## Summary

“There is always somewhere higher to climb. And in the grand scheme of things, what I have accomplished was flashy and exciting, but not particularly tactically relevant. The loss of one ship for the imperial fleet is nothing, and while the saving of four hundred Alliance soldiers may mean much to their families, in a war where battles regularly involve the lives and deaths of millions of people, it’s insignificant.”

“You want to be in charge of the lives and deaths of millions?”

Reinhard’s smile showed teeth. “I would like to see the Goldenbaum dynasty destroyed,” he said. “And that is a goal that will involve a great many people, a far greater number than are on a single ship, or in a single fleet, even.”

This is part four of a very involved roleswap AU. At minimum, you should read part two \(Life Out of Balance\) before reading this part. Just as science fiction plays fast and loose with the laws of physics, so too do I play fast and loose with some elements of canon. Tags/relationships will be updated as chapters are posted.

## Notes

THERE IS A PERIOD WHEN IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE GONE WRONG BUT YOU CONTINUE. SOMETIMES THERE IS A LUXURIOUS AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE ANYTHING BAD HAPPENS.
