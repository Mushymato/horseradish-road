## Summary

Three soldiers. Two bodies to be buried. One haunted house.

This story takes place immediately after the events of "Servants of the Pharaoh". You really have to read that one before this will make any sense at all.

## Notes

There’s bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet, no matter where you live.
