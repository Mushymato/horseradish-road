## Summary

Out of the blue, Reuenthal said, "You should be more ambitious\." He looked across the table at Yang\. "Other people will like you more if they see you have interests outside of history\."

Yang hesitated a moment, picking up his teacup before answering\. "I have ambitions\."

"Oh? What kind?"

Yang hid a small smile behind his teacup\. "The wrong kind\."

When Reuenthal didn't say anything in response, Yang returned to his reading, though he could feel Reuenthal's eyes on him\. After about half a minute of silent study, Reuenthal said, "I think I am a man with the wrong kind of ambitions, as well\."

Yang didn't look up to meet Reuenthal's eyes, but he gave a quick nod\.

[Roleswap AU, this is part 1 of a longer planned work\. This part covers the years UC 782\-787\. Aside from the obvious, some mild liberties have been taken with the OVA canon\. Spelling of character names is whatever I want it to be\. This story may or may not manage to simultaneously annoy and please both reuyang and reumitt shippers so take that as you may\. This work is being crossposted to royalroad\.]

## Notes

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal\.
