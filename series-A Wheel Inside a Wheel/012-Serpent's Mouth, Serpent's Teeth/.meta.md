## Summary

After agreeing to help Duke Braunschweig put his daughter on the Imperial throne in exchange for Mittermeyer's life, Yang must figure out how to not just survive, but win the largest civil war in human history\.
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
Part Five of *A Wheel Inside a Wheel*\. At bare minimum, you must read *Speaking In Tongues* and *Servants of the Pharaoh* before reading this work\.

## Notes

If you didn't read *Keep the Home Fires \(Burning\)*, you probably should do that before you read this story\. It contains a major event that is relevant in this chapter\.

Also, SMST covers many of the events of *Lighting Out for the Territories* from the other side\. The two books can be read independently, or in either order, but each does contain spoilers for the other, so pick your poison when it comes to reading order :\)
