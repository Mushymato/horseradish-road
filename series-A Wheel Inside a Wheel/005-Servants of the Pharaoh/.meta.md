## Summary

“Unfortunately, Commander, on that point you might be wrong,” Yang said, smiling a little\. “I’m a very lazy man, and I have no great desire to provide distinguished services to the Goldenbaum dynasty\.” 

“And yet you are one of the Goldenbaum dynasty’s servants\.”

“I shall strive to be a humble one\.”

“Why is that?”

“It seems strange that I would need to explain why I dislike the idea of being an effective weapon of war\.”

“Sub\-lieutenant,” Oberstein said, “you stand out by virtue of your being\. It might be to your benefit to be above reproach in your actions, which by necessity means being successful\.”

Yang scratched his head\. “Maybe\.”

“But perhaps all of this is dangerous talk,” Oberstein said\.

## Notes

I catch a movement of his
     lips, but he won’t
speak – You don’t    love me?
     – Yes, but in torment

drained and driven to death
     \(He looks round like an eagle\)
– You call this    home? That’s
     in the heart\. – What *literature*\!

Love is flesh, it is a
     flower flooded with blood\.
Did you think it was just a
     little chat across a table

a snatched hour and back home again
     the way gentlemen and ladies
play at it? Either love is…
– A shrine?
                                – or else a scar\.

A scar    every servant and guest
     can see \(and I think silently:
love is a bow\-string pulled
     back to the point of breaking\)\.
