## Summary

“Do you take my silence as an admission of guilt?”

“What else can I take it as?”

“Silence, and nothing more.”

“I’m forced to imagine, Reinhard.”

“Are you so painfully curious? Will knowing satisfy you?” Reinhard’s voice was bitter. “Must I put into words for you something that I don’t dare to put into words for myself?”

Eventually, Annerose said, “Yes.”
