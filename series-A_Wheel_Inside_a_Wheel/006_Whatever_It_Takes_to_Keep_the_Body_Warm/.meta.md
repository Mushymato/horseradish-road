## Summary

“I’m going to Kapche-Lanka,” Reuenthal finally said. “There’s going to be a ground campaign there, to try to retake some of the bases that were overrun a few years ago.”

Yang took a sip of his beer. “How interesting.”

“I’ll have a battalion of my own,” Reuenthal said.

“Congratulations,” Yang said. He had an odd expression on his face, one that Reuenthal couldn’t quite parse.

-----------------

This side story is part of a longer roleswap AU. It takes place in 484/485 IC, between chapters 16 and 17 of Servants of the Pharaoh . It concerns Mittermeyer and Reuenthal on Kapche-Lanka. You should probably read at least Part One (Speaking in Tongues) and Part Three (Servants of the Pharaoh) up to chapter 16 before reading this story. Tags will be updated as chapters are posted. OVA canon is respected in the way that one might respect the speed limit on your local highway.
