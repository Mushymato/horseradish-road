<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <em>
    <span>October 481 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Although they had the option of a funeral, out in one of the military cemeteries that dotted the countryside, Martin‚Äôs mother elected not to have one. His father yelled about it‚Äî just a little‚Äî the kind of yelling a man does when he doesn‚Äôt know how to cry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt bury your son?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúBury?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúWhat body? If you want to go look at an empty grave, you do it. I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt make myself.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin had not been given a choice in the matter, even though he was old enough to have an opinion. He was dispossessed to agree with his mother on most things, as a matter of course, but the nagging thought in the back of his mind was that Christopher would have wanted a funeral‚Äî a big one, as big as they could manage, where everyone was forced to look at his smiling uniform photo and cry about how handsome he had been.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wasn‚Äôt supposed to smile when that picture was taken, he said. They told everyone to look serious. But just before the photographer finished his countdown, before he could take his finger off the shutter button, Christopher had cracked his biggest grin, showing off the gap tooth and dimples that gave him a boyish handsomeness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Martin grew older, he would understand that the boyish face was not just due to Christopher‚Äôs features: he still was a boy, not even twenty. This was not apparent to Martin at age fourteen. His brother, five years the elder, had always seemed impossibly adult, and impossibly unique. As an adult, too, Martin wondered how many boys had managed to break rank‚Äî that one tiny act of defiance‚Äî and smile for the camera in the face of death. Hundreds, thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although they didn‚Äôt have a funeral, when the local paper published the usual note of which boys from the district had died, Martin‚Äôs mother held unofficial visiting hours at their house. Everyone in town who had known Christopher, or knew the Bufholtz family, came by. It was a veritable procession of high school teachers and athletic coaches, former classmates dragged in by their mothers, three of Christopher‚Äôs old girlfriends, his mother‚Äôs friends, one or two of his father‚Äôs coworkers.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a well known ritual. Martin had been on the other end of it at least twice that he could remember, but had never imagined what it would be like to sit there himself all day and listen to people murmur how sorry they were. But how could he have imagined it? If anyone tried to think of what it would be like beforehand, if they really succeeded at it, they would do anything it took to stop their son or brother from going away. Or they should have.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin sat stiffly in the armchair in the corner of the living room, wearing his best suit and positioning himself like a doll. He tried to move as little as possible, because he thought if he moved, if someone noticed him, he might be forced to say something. And what was there to say?¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His parents sat together on the loveseat, though his father often got up and left the room, leaving his mother alone to face the somber women who came in. The young children who were brought along pulled faces at Martin, peeking out from behind their mothers‚Äô legs, and stole the cookies from the coffee table. The women never accepted his mother‚Äôs half-frantic offer of tea and something to eat, but Christopher‚Äôs former classmates took the food, with a guilty look in their eyes as they said their condolences between bites, and then left as soon as their own mothers would allow. The food didn‚Äôt run out: people brought covered dishes as offerings, and the Bufholtzes ended up with more than they started with. A feast of crudites which would inevitably end up in the trash.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps that was a kind of </span>
  <em>
    <span>libation</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Martin thought. His junior high school class had been going through a myths and legends unit for the past several months, and he allowed this to occupy his mind as he sat there in silence. Although the boys who came through the living room shook his father‚Äôs hand and murmured something about Valhalla, Martin found it very hard to picture the ancient halls of gods and warriors filled with men in his brother‚Äôs uniform, and he found it even harder to picture his brother at the table with them, feasting all night and going out to fight the next day. Perhaps he just found it hard to picture because he was too familiar with the Empire‚Äôs religion‚Äî there was no escaping the sense of falseness that came with being told the divine coexisted with the mundane. But perhaps it was because he couldn‚Äôt picture his brother as a soldier very well at all. The only image they had of him in uniform was his smiling one, and he made it look more like a costume than anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was hard to think about him being dead. Martin was like Orpheus coming up from Hades with Eurydice behind him: so long as he imagined Christopher somewhere off in the next room, silent and just out of sight behind his shoulder, he still might be alive there. If he turned to look, tried to search for him, that was when he would be dead. He might be able to keep up this mental deception for some time, he thought. The reality had not yet sunk in, despite the house filling with mourners. He was numb with it completely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only Christopher‚Äôs girlfriends, who had sometimes found Martin cute enough to acknowledge his existence when they visited the house in happier days, were in danger of saying something more to him than a rote phrase or two. Martin had memorized an answer to the simple condolences, repeating what his mother said like a parrot. ‚ÄúThank you. Christopher would have been glad you came.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of these girlfriends, Emmeline, the last of the three, who had broken up with Christopher at the end of his last year of schooling, clutched a bouquet of roses in her arms. It was bigger than her head, and she didn‚Äôt seem to know what to do with it. The whole room was already filled with flowers from the other visitors, sitting in vases on every available surface: above the fireplace, on the windowsills, strewn across the kitchen table, set on the bookshelves, and finally placed on the floor when they ran out of other places for them to go. Most of these flowers were lilies and other white blossoms‚Äî appropriate for a funeral, even if there wasn‚Äôt one‚Äî and when Martin let his eyes unfocus, they made the room look like it was covered in a dusting of snow. Emmeline‚Äôs red eyes fell on Martin, and she handed the bouquet to him. Martin took it, though it dwarfed his lap.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The roses thus handed off, Emmeline no longer looked at him, and Martin ran his finger down the stem of one of the flowers, finding a thorn and pressing his fingertip into it, like a diabetic‚Äôs needle looking for the right signs of life. When he felt it break the skin, a bubble of blood emerged, and he wiped his hand on his pants.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúHe would have been happy you came,‚Äù his mother said to Emmeline in the painful silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDid he ever mention me in his letters?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou had broken up with him, hadn‚Äôt you?‚Äù his father asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt was stupid,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really want to‚Äî‚Äù She rubbed at her face. ‚ÄúWe just‚Äî‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he understood in the end,‚Äù his mother said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDid he say anything to you when he left?‚Äù Emmeline asked. ‚ÄúDid he know this was going to happen?‚Äù¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúHow could he have known?‚Äù Martin‚Äôs father asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúNo, I know, I‚Äôm being stupid,‚Äù she said.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin‚Äôs father got up from the couch again and left the room, heading outside to smoke another cigarette. His mother remained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhat did he say when we saw him off, Martin?‚Äù his mother asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember,‚Äù Martin said. This wasn‚Äôt true. He remembered it perfectly clearly.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the day he left, Christopher had shaken their father‚Äôs hand, then hugged their mother, and then turned to Martin. They were all in the parking lot of the big military spaceport just outside the capital city, and occasionally they saw a ship lift up into the sky overhead, rising like a rock would fall. It was a beautiful summer day, and Christopher was already sweating in his black uniform, though he tried not to show it. He constantly readjusted it, pulling it into place‚Äî he was shorter and sturdier than the uniform had been designed for, so the shirt kept riding up. He looked at Martin with a goofy smile. The two boys could not have been more different in appearance: where Christopher was broad shouldered, Martin was slender; where Christopher was handsome and funny, Martin was odd and quiet.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Christopher looked down at him and punched his shoulder. ‚ÄúGuess you‚Äôll have to be the man around here when I‚Äôm gone, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even Martin knew that he was only saying it just because it was a thing boys ought to say to their younger brothers, and he was joking‚Äî laughing silently, round cheeks crinkling up over his eyes. It was a funny joke, perhaps, considering how little like a man Martin was. He should have played along, but he hadn‚Äôt yet discovered the skill to differentiate between being laughed with and laughed at, so instead he shoved his fists in his pockets and scuffed the ground with his toe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be back,‚Äù he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be taller than me when I get home,‚Äù Christopher said. He bumped his shoulder up against Martin‚Äôs. ‚ÄúLook‚Äî you‚Äôre almost there already.‚Äù If this was true, it didn‚Äôt feel true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Christopher said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt miss me too bad, I guess.‚Äù There wasn‚Äôt anything more that could be said so he gave a wave to his family and headed off towards the big glass doors of the spaceport. He glanced over his shoulder every few steps as he left, and just before he pulled open the big double doors, he turned one last time. Martin managed a wave; his parents were already getting back in the car. Christopher smiled, and then headed inside, and that was the last Martin saw of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They weren‚Äôt told how he had died, and they weren‚Äôt given a body to bury.</span>
</p><p>¬†</p><hr/><p>¬†</p><p>
  <span>Martin‚Äôs father insisted that life go on as normal, so he didn‚Äôt take any time off from work, and Martin was to go to school. His mother shook him awake, as she had every morning for years, and he didn‚Äôt speak a word of complaint as he got dressed. The bouquet of roses was on the hall table, and as his mother forced him out the door to walk to school, he grabbed one and stuck it in the lapel of his grey uniform.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He entertained the thought of skipping class, if only briefly, but he didn‚Äôt know where he would go. It was a blustery period in October, the temperature unseasonably cold and hovering just above freezing, so he couldn‚Äôt stay outside even if he wanted to. The haunts in walking distance that he could imagine (the grocery store, the library, the pub) were all accustomed to calling the school to report wandering truant children. There wouldn‚Äôt have been any point in skipping school, except for that it would have been what </span>
  <em>
    <span>Christopher</span>
  </em>
  <span> would have done, if he had been the one who had lived, and Martin the one who had died.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Christopher had never really liked studying, which was how he had ended up in the fleet so early. If he had gotten an admission to any school around‚Äî not even an important one, like Odin National University, but even just a vocational school‚Äî he would have been able to defer his service for another few years, if not avoid it completely. But he had been uninterested in that, so had entered the fleet directly out of high school.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt‚Äôll give me a few more years to decide what I want to do with myself, anyway,‚Äù he said to their mother, which had made her very annoyed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúSo would a higher education,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wasting your potential, you know.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúMy potential will still be there in three years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going anywhere.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was easy to look up to Christopher‚Äôs dislike of school as an unattainable aspiration‚Äî yet another area in which Martin fell short. He liked academics, or wasn‚Äôt interesting enough to dislike them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Martin discarded the thought of skipping school, he tried to equally push Christopher out of his mind. He managed, for a while, by constructing vast corridors of emptiness where all his thoughts should have been.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No one spoke to him at school, not for days, aside from calling his name for roll. His teachers didn‚Äôt protest at all when he put his head down on his arms and ignored the lessons completely. Even when he kept his head up, the words of his teachers were a meaningless ring and buzz. He didn‚Äôt retain anything that was said to him, if he heard it in the first place. He had somehow become a ghost inside his own life. A week passed like this, though he hardly was aware of the time going by.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wouldn‚Äôt have even noticed it was Friday afternoon, if not for the fact that on the last Friday of every month, the last two hours of the day were allotted to their grade being ushered into the school‚Äôs auditorium. It was different every month what they were subjected to during this time. Sometimes it was testing, sometimes it was a guest lecturer, sometimes it was a special lesson on health, but today the mood of the class was jubilant: one student had overheard that they were going to get to watch a movie.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It appeared to be true. Martin took a seat near the very back of the auditorium, in the dark shadowy place covered by the overhead room with the projector equipment. Even with the lights on, it was dark enough back there to sleep. When all the rest of the three hundred or so boys had filed their way in to the auditorium‚Äôs narrow seats, one of the literature teachers stepped up on stage and yelled (no one had given him a microphone) that to cap off their unit, they would be watching an adaptation of one of the stories they had read. Some of the boys cheered before being shushed by teachers standing by the edges of the rows.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin slumped down in his seat, pressing his knees up against the back of the chair of the boy in front of him, as the lights in the auditorium flicked off, and the projector blinked to life. Although he tried to gather enthusiasm for watching a movie (at the very least, it would be something to take him out of himself for two hours), all he could muster was a vague sense of disappointment that their literature unit was ending. He had enjoyed it, up until this last week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could tell right away what kind of film this was going to be: the very first image that appeared on screen was the imprimateur‚Äôs mark, the golden seal with the crowned eagle. This was a government film, and even at fourteen, Martin knew that films from Phezzan were more entertaining to watch. It was an older movie, too. The date beneath the signature of the official who had signed off on the film‚Äôs release was from more than a hundred years ago. It must be a classic. He glanced around in the dark and located his teachers. Usually during these things, if the boys were under control, the teachers left en masse to go grade papers or smoke outside, but today most of them had taken up residence in the emptier back rows near where he was sitting and were watching the projection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt make a movie like this these days,‚Äù Martin‚Äôs algebra teacher said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù one of the other math teachers asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúAfter building Iserlohn? You couldn‚Äôt make a movie about a walled city falling. It‚Äôd look like rebel propaganda.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other teacher laughed, but was shushed as the pounding drumbeat music of the movie‚Äôs opening sequence swelled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The film was called </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Fall of Troy</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and was based on one of the myths they had studied. In class, they had read a short adaptation of the Trojan war story. It seemed like that might have only been included in the curriculum as an excuse for the teachers to watch this movie on school time.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a spectacle from its first moments, clearly a high-budget film compared to what they were usually shown in these assemblies‚Äî cheap productions with untalented actors reciting hamfisted scripts about the dangers of drugs or the benefits of various careers. The actors here were all perfect specimens‚Äî the one playing Achilles was particularly beautiful: tall and broad shouldered, with curly blond hair. It was actually a little funny, a part of Martin‚Äôs dazed brain managed to comment, whoever had made this film had chosen actors according to such a strict standard of appearance that the woman Briseis could have been Achilles‚Äôs sister rather than his captive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every shot, from the thrashing sea and the boats leashed to the shore, to the sweeping plains and the churning river near Troy, to the walls of the city itself, was framed to make the viewer feel small. When looking at the actors, the camera always positioned them to look not-quite human‚Äî taking up too much space in the frame and too much air in the auditorium when they spoke.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed to Martin that this was a loose adaptation, even compared to what was written in the short version of the story they had read in class. The way the fight for Troy was described by the attacking Greeks was as a matter of national unification‚Äî even a well made film couldn‚Äôt escape the heavy-handed influence of the government program that had funded it. But whoever had been the creative brain behind this movie hadn‚Äôt cared much about that; those lines stuck out because they were incongruous with the tone of the rest of the movie, which was wholly concerned with the spectacle of war. Even the ostensible central plot of Achilles‚Äôs rage, and the way the scriptwriter twisted his refusal to fight into a narrative of unpatriotic desertion for which he had to be duly punished, was merely a frame on which to hang the action.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The battles were lovingly rendered, spears and swords glittering in the sun. Horses gleamed with sweat, and so did men. When the Trojans fell, the picture took delight in their deaths, panning up from the gore and lingering on the victor standing over them; when the Greeks were toppled, the camera closed in on their suffering faces and tried to find meaning there.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There weren‚Äôt many named Trojans in the film‚Äî it was their battle to lose after all‚Äî but there couldn‚Äôt be a story without them. To distinguish them from the Greeks, they were given darker hair and coarser features, though clearly the producer had cast for beauty here too.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although at the start of the film, after realizing what kind of movie it was going to be, Martin had tried to close his eyes to it and take a nap, sinking further and further down into his seat, he found himself unable to look away whenever Hector and his brother Paris were on screen. The two were brothers, though they were different as night and day: Hector was broad shouldered and smiling, always dashing forwards to meet the Greeks with his spear, while Paris was small and crafty, and picked them off with arrows from afar. The actors who played the two brothers had an undeniable chemistry, even when their characters were at odds. Martin couldn‚Äôt avoid making the mental comparison, but he tried to avoid thinking it consciously, letting it float just out of reach as he stared up at the screen, unblinking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was hard to watch the film when he knew what was coming. Troy had to fall to the Greeks‚Äî this was the only way the story could end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The climax of the film was the fated fight between Hector and Achilles. It seemed to stretch on forever. Martin felt trapped by it, his fingernails digging into his palms as he mentally begged for Hector to escape into the walls of Troy when Achilles chased him. When Hector didn‚Äôt hide inside the city, Martin silently pled for some one of his countrymen to come out and help him when he stood against Achilles, face to face. And then, only then, did Martin beg for Hector to win the fight that he could not win‚Äî spear and sword both falling uselessly against Achilles‚Äô armor.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn‚Äôt cry when Achilles stabbed Hector through the throat, but he found himself unable to breathe when Hector begged for Achilles to return his body to his family, somehow able to speak even as the blood gushed out and spilled down onto the dirt. When Achilles refused, and stripped Hector‚Äôs body bare to drag behind his chariot around the city, Martin got up from his seat and fled the auditorium, pushing past his classmates in the fumbling darkness. No one cared that he left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once the auditorium doors shut behind him, freeing him from the relentless pounding of the movie‚Äôs soundtrack, the halls of the school were eerily silent. It was the last hour of the school day, and the nearby hallways were empty, since all of his class was in the auditorium. Martin wasn‚Äôt sure where he was going, but he found himself at the back doors of the upper grade hallway, the ones that led out to the teachers‚Äô parking lot and the big dumpsters behind the cafeteria. There were no windows on this side of the building, which was why the teachers all came out this way to smoke, but none of them were there now. It was deserted, and no one would find Martin there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wasn‚Äôt thinking about evading detection when he slipped outside. He was just grateful to the bitterly cold air for reminding him that he could breathe still, though being reminded that he could breathe let him know that he could cry. He crouched down next to the dumpster, amid all the flicked away cigarette butts, and covered his head with his arms. The rumpled rose that had been tucked into the lapel of his jacket worked its way free and fell to the ground, and a gust of wind sent it skittering across the parking lot, though Martin didn‚Äôt notice. He was too engaged with trying to choke down and swallow his sobs, a losing battle if there ever was one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hadn‚Äôt really cried yet. It hadn‚Äôt felt real enough yet‚Äî without a body how could it feel real? But maybe that had been a lie he had told himself, to stay wrapped in the protective shroud of numbness for as long as possible. None of his thoughts now were clearer at all, but the pain was, all of a sudden.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hector‚Äôs body would be fed to the dogs, Martin thought, over and over, unable to think of anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He fell backwards from his crouch out onto the asphalt, laying on his back, arms spread. The sky was grey, and the few tree limbs he could see reaching over the dumpsters were bare and skeletal. What did it feel like, he wondered, to be dragged behind Achilles‚Äô chariot? He stared up at the sky and let the cold ground steal the heat from his body. He lay there, with the tears drying on his face, for some time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn‚Äôt even notice someone approaching until a shadow fell across him. Martin was sure it was one of his teachers, and almost would have been relieved to be scolded and hauled back inside, but then the tall shadow sat down on the dirty asphalt next to him, and Martin could just barely see his shock of red hair from his position on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was one of his classmates: Kircheis. The two boys only shared one class together this year, algebra, but since they had been attending the same schools together for about nine years, they both were passingly familiar with the other.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was tall, very tall, and his school uniforms no longer fit‚Äî his wrists poked out of the sleeves, and a few too many centimeters of black sock showed at his ankles, even after someone had let down the hems of his pants. Despite his rapid growth, he didn‚Äôt look gangly and awkward like a few of the other boys did: he wore his height like it fitted him better than his clothes, and he had a very careful, measured way of moving that made it seem like he had always been this tall, and didn‚Äôt need to get used to it. He and Martin shared the top of the class academics-wise: they often found themselves standing together on stage at the end-of-year awards for best students, though Martin knew he fared better in language and history, and Kircheis did better in math.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite that, they had never spoken more than a few words to each other, having never had much of an occasion to. Martin was quiet and unassuming, and Kircheis always had a following‚Äî not exactly one of popularity, but because he never turned away anyone who wanted something from him. He was universally generous, which might have made him an object of scorn for some of the crueler boys, but Kircheis had also never seen a fight that he couldn‚Äôt end. The other students tended to either look up to him or ignore him, which had always struck Martin as a very lonely kind of existence. If he had been forced to choose a side of that dichotomy, he would have also looked up to Kircheis (it was hard not to), but he felt a distinct discomfort in admitting that he did. If he wanted any acknowledgement from Kircheis, it was not whatever he gave to the cadre of boys who wanted his quiet words of approval and help with their algebra work. And if Kircheis thought he wanted that now, Martin was faintly disgusted by the idea. But that didn‚Äôt seem likely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was very strange that Kircheis was sitting beside him out behind the dumpsters‚Äî the two best students skipping school together. The strangeness of it, and the the long silence that stretched on between them, finally made Martin turn his head to look at Kircheis properly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDid someone send you out here to get me?‚Äù he asked. His voice cracked, his throat still full of the remnants of tears, which made him feel even more embarrassed and pathetic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Kircheis said. ‚ÄúI was just taking a walk. I‚Äôve been out here for a while.‚Äù¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy did you leave?‚Äù Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like the movie very much.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOh. Me neither.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDo you want to see what I found?‚Äù Kircheis asked. It might have been an attempt at cheering Martin, though it wasn‚Äôt likely to work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis reached beside himself and held up a fragile little bird‚Äôs nest, the former inhabitants long since flown off to warmer climes. Nestled inside it was the rose that had previously adorned Martin‚Äôs jacket.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin put his hand to his chest, noticing for the first time that it had gone missing. Kircheis smiled, though it was a somber expression, and picked the rose back out of the bird‚Äôs nest. Tentatively, asking permission with his slowness, he reached over and tucked it back into the buttonhole of Martin‚Äôs jacket. Martin touched the soft petals with his fingertip, then let his hand flop back down to the ground. He closed his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI saw it in the parking lot,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI thought it was yours.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI think my dad grows that kind of rose,‚Äù Kircheis said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a summer flower.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúFlorists get them shipped in,‚Äù Martin said. It was a silly thing to say, and he regretted his abrasive tone immediately‚Äî there was no way Kircheis didn‚Äôt already know that. But he didn‚Äôt seem offended to have the obvious pointed out to him, or at least he didn‚Äôt get up and leave.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about your brother,‚Äù Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin didn‚Äôt know what to say, so he just nodded. They were both silent once more. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to sit out here with me,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go back in,‚Äù Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI think the movie‚Äôs almost over.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù Kircheis agreed.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get in trouble if they catch you out here.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDo you want me to go?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin fell silent, which was enough of an answer for Kircheis, and he stayed sitting there next to Martin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was the one to break the silence next, which surprised Martin. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why they made us watch that movie,‚Äù he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a patriotic film,‚Äù Martin said, opening his eyes and turning to look at Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThere are a million of those.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThe teachers like it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Kircheis said. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know why.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin felt a sudden flash of anger‚Äî the first truly new feeling that had broken through the haze of his thoughts in a while. He clung to it like a lifeline. ‚ÄúSome people just enjoy cruelty,‚Äù he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis flinched. ‚ÄúI hope not,‚Äù he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think so?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was quiet for a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù He seemed to be considering his words very carefully. ‚ÄúAn old friend of mine tried to explain something like that to me, once,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people like cruelty‚Äî I think they just try to find ways to see beauty in it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWho said that?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúReinhard von Musel.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOh, that transfer student.‚Äù Martin looked back up at the sky. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a stupid thing to say.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù Kircheis looked down at his hands, at the bird‚Äôs nest in them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy would anybody want to find something beautiful in it?‚Äù Martin asked. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing beautiful about it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt see another way to live with it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs your answer,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they showed it to us. As a lesson in how to live with it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin was almost immediately sorry for his anger‚Äî there was no reason for him to be angry at Kircheis, of all people, but Kircheis was the one who was there, and he just nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt was a stupid movie, anyway,‚Äù Martin said after a minute, trying to calm himself down, trying to offer something to Kircheis, rather than push him away. ‚ÄúI think they would just take any story and twist it to be whatever they wanted. It was like the movie didn‚Äôt even matter except for being a way to carry the fighting. It‚Äôs stupid.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah. It‚Äôs nothing like the original.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve read it?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Kircheis said. ‚ÄúMy teacher gave me a copy.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWho do you have for lit?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúHerr Steiner.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOh. So do I.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúHe probably would have told you, too, if‚Äî‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Martin looked away. ‚ÄúMaybe he did. I haven‚Äôt been paying attention.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in my locker,‚Äù Kircheis said. ‚ÄúYou can have it, if you want. I‚Äôm done with it. Herr Steiner wouldn‚Äôt mind.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin nodded, but it was an apathetic nod.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt really is different,‚Äù Kircheis said again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their conversation was interrupted by the shrill scream of the school bell signaling the end of the day. Martin, still laying flat on the ground, knew that he had to get up, but felt detached from his limbs, like he didn‚Äôt know how to work them anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWe should go,‚Äù Kircheis said. ‚ÄúThe teachers will all be coming out here in a minute.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Martin said. He didn‚Äôt move until Kircheis stood and offered him his hand to haul him to his feet. Martin took it, and he felt unexpectedly dizzy as he stood. Vainly, Kircheis walked behind Martin and brushed the dirt and grime off his back. It made Martin shiver.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis held open the door, and he and Martin slipped back inside. As usual, the ringing of the bell had caused a flood of students towards the front of the building, and so there weren‚Äôt many around in the back hallway to see them enter. They grabbed their bags from their lockers and walked out to the front. Students were fanning out from the courtyard in every direction, running or walking down the streets to their houses, alone or in groups.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis stopped when they reached the sidewalk. ‚ÄúCan I walk you home?‚Äù he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin frowned at him. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you live in the other direction?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need an escort.‚Äù He was feeling abrasive once more, maybe just because the privacy of the strange shared moment near the dumpsters had been lost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI want to.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis met Martin‚Äôs eyes. It was very strange to suddenly realize that Kircheis wasn‚Äôt lying‚Äî he </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> want something from Martin, something his crowd of hangers-on couldn‚Äôt give him.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúNeither of us wanted to learn how to live with it,‚Äù Kircheis said, very quietly. They looked at each other for a moment, then Martin nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis followed him down the street, and then into the woods when Martin dipped into his usual shortcut. It was very quiet there, as soon as the shouts of departing students and the noise of cars faded away. It wasn‚Äôt a very long way to Martin‚Äôs house, but he didn‚Äôt walk quickly. There was nothing good waiting for him at home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was silent as they walked, but it was a companionable silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIn the book,‚Äù Martin began when they were not far from his house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDoes anyone in Troy get Hector‚Äôs body back? After Achilles feeds it to the dogs?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThe dogs don‚Äôt eat it,‚Äù Kircheis said. ‚ÄúThe gods protect it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOh.‚Äù¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis could tell this answer was unsatisfying. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin shrugged. He plucked at the rose tucked into his jacket, pulled it out, and twirled it between his fingers. The petals were looking worse for wear, the flower wilted now, but it still retained its color, a twirl of red in his fingers. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt matters to you.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúAnd what can anybody do about it?‚Äù he asked. He had raised his voice again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis just nodded, and looked down at his feet as they walked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Kircheis‚Äî I‚Äôm just‚Äî‚Äù Martin said finally. His street was coming into view through the last brush of trees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúSiegfried,‚Äù he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúPlease‚Äî just call me Siegfried.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin stopped walking to look at him. ‚ÄúSiegfried,‚Äù he said. The name felt very funny on his tongue, even though it was a common name, one he had heard in hundreds of different places. He found he had to look away. ‚ÄúCan I borrow that book?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOf course. Here,‚Äù Siegfried said. He swung his backpack off his back, and held out the bird‚Äôs nest he was still carrying to Martin, who took it, holding it gently in his hands. Martin placed the rose inside. He watched Siegfried fish around in the backpack for a moment, and he came out with a tattered paperback, a drawing of soldiers in shining helmets on the cover. He held it out to Martin. They traded again, passing the bird‚Äôs nest back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin flipped through the book, looking at the lines of poetry and illustrations. He paged right through to the end. ‚ÄúAnd so they held a funeral for Hector, tamer of horses,‚Äù he said, reading the last line. He was surprised that the book ended this way, not with a line about the Greek victory. It was a very melancholy way to end the poem.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>¬†‚ÄúMy mother didn‚Äôt want to have a funeral at an empty grave,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI suppose she was right‚Äî it wouldn‚Äôt have done him any good, since he wasn‚Äôt there.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to have a grave to remember someone with.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThere probably is a headstone in a fleet cemetery somewhere.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWill you ever go to it?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thought disgusted Martin, and his lip curled involuntarily. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried nodded. He seemed about to say something, offer advice, but he stopped himself. Maybe that was for the best. He looked through the woods, at the street they were approaching. ‚ÄúIs that your house?‚Äù he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúJust a little further,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on that street.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to come all the way,‚Äù Martin said, and this time, Siegfried took the offer to let him go for what it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúAlright. Will you be in school on Monday?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll see you then.‚Äù He looked at the bird‚Äôs nest in his hand, and saw that it still had Martin‚Äôs flower in it. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said, holding it out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin reached for the flower, but Siegfried gestured for him to take the whole bird‚Äôs nest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou take it. I have too many of these,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always finding them.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the first time, Martin smiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because you‚Äôre so tall‚Äî all the nests are at eye level for you.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù he said, but he was smiling too. ‚ÄúI just put them in a tree near my house. Sometimes other birds will find them and live there‚Äî makes it easy for them if they don‚Äôt have to build their own nest, I guess. Here‚Äî take it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin did, though he wasn‚Äôt sure why Siegfried was so insistent. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you on Monday.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried‚Äôs smile brightened like the sun‚Äî it was almost difficult to look at, and it made Martin feel very strange.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Siegfried said. He picked up his bookbag from the leaf litter on the ground, swung it over his shoulders, and gave a little wave‚Äî for the first time seeming quite awkward and funny‚Äî he wasn‚Äôt sure how to leave. ‚ÄúBye, then.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúBye, Siegfried,‚Äù Martin said. He watched him head off back through the woods.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Martin arrived at his house, the quiet surrounding it like a tomb, he slipped into his room without his mother hearing him. He sat on his bed with the borrowed book on his knees and the bird‚Äôs nest cupped gently in his hands. It seemed like the kind of thing his mother would yell at him for if she found it on his dresser‚Äî when Christopher had found a small animal‚Äôs skeleton and displayed it in his room, his mother had yelled loud enough to wake the dead‚Äî so Martin instead opened his window and put the bird‚Äôs nest outside, in the corner of his windowsill, where it was protected from the wind. Maybe birds would come by in the spring, though that season was still many months away.</span>

  <em>
    <span>June 483 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin spent very little time at home his freshman year of high school. Though he had always had a fair amount of liberty to go where he wanted, he had not ever felt the desire to exercise it until he had gotten to high school and realized how little he wanted to be in his house. Although Martin was not part of any extracurriculars, he stayed at school long hours anyways, usually sitting in the library and getting his homework done. He would wait until Sieg was done with practice for whatever sport he was participating in that season, and until the school emptied out and the janitors began to get anxious to lock the doors. Usually, he‚Äôd walk Sieg home, lingering at his front gate until he sighed or smiled and said that he had to get his homework done. After that, Martin would go where he pleased, sometimes just wandering, until he grew hungry enough that he had no choice but to go home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rather paradoxically, the end of the school year, with its massive increase in freedom, had disrupted this schedule quite severely. Without school to go to, Martin hated the endless feeling of needing to fill his days. It didn‚Äôt help that Sieg had a job: bussing tables at a local pub. He was busy most of the time, or at least in unpredictable enough hours that Martin couldn‚Äôt form a fixed schedule around his presences and absences.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a peculiarly lonely feeling. Sieg was the first real friend Martin had ever had‚Äî or at least the first friend of his caliber. They could talk endlessly, about any subject under the sun, or just enjoy a thousand private hours in each other‚Äôs company. During the time they spent together, Martin didn‚Äôt notice his happiness, but he missed it as soon as he left Sieg at his gate. Being with him gave a sense of contentment‚Äî one that discomfited Martin in some ways. It was difficult for him to relax, even in Sieg‚Äôs calming presence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Summer had only just begun a few weeks before, but already the twelve weeks seemed to stretch on endlessly, a river of time. Martin read a lot, spent too much time on his computer, and walked down by the river.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Today, he made his way to the library. He had, over the past couple years, undertaken a serious course of self study on various subjects. The subject that fascinated him the most was history, though it was more of a history of stories than a history of facts.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After he had come out of his coma of grief after Christopher died, Martin had nurtured the seed of anger that had been planted in his chest. There was the anger at the war that had killed him, of course, but as his grief became easier to bear, the anger broadened. Almost more than the war, he hated the way the lies that justified it. He found himself going back through everything he had ever been taught, and looking at it with as glaring of an eye as he could muster. He trawled backwards in time, trying to understand if the root of evil was a new invention particular to his time, or how long it had been a part of the human race. His answers, so far, had been inconclusive‚Äî but the more he read, the more he wanted to read.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He found himself speaking with like-minded people online, and made friends that way. He used a pseudonym and pretended to be older than he really was, but everyone did the former, and he suspected that plenty did the latter as well. He hadn‚Äôt understood how it would feel to join into a broad conversation, one that felt like it had been going on for thousands of years. The other members of his online circles tended to be radical, and Martin enjoyed the talk. He often reported what was said to Sieg, who listened, though only contributed the occasional soft word. It was clear that Sieg agreed with him, but he wasn‚Äôt seized by the same passion to participate in the shaping of the discussion‚Äî he was content, or happy, to let Martin dictate the scope of their political thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The library closed early in the summer, so Martin tried to make the best use of his time. In the morning, he did his reading. Today, almost at random, he had chosen several ancient plays, which he thought he could get through in one sitting if he focused. Perhaps later that night, he would try to find a recording of them played out. But he sat in one of the chairs in the far back of the stacks, and worked through them. At lunch, he ate whatever snacks he had jammed in his pockets when he left his house in the morning‚Äî he rarely paid attention to what he was grabbing. Then after lunch, in the remaining time before the library closed, he tried to catch up on his online discussions (he decided that looking at some of them on public computers was better for him than keeping them all on his home internet, though he sometimes wondered if he was being paranoid). And on the way out the door of the library, he would grab the copy of the daily paper‚Äî technically theft, but no one cared enough to stop him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sat on the grass outside and read it, flipping through one page of news after another. Most of it didn‚Äôt interest him, but for weeks a main subject of online conversation had been the trial of a fleet defector. He was fully expected to get the death penalty, though his trial had been interesting in that he had staunchly refused to plead either guilt or innocence, and had instead remained completely silent for the duration of the trial. Martin, along with the rest of his online circle, admired him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin skimmed the paper for the report on the trial, and found it, though also next to it a deeply grim article. Ten young men had been arrested outside the courthouse, and Martin could only suspect they were there in conjunction with the trial, though the article gave no indication of that. It was unclear if they had been trying to rescue the defector, or simply show up to support him. It didn‚Äôt matter‚Äî they were in custody now, and it was unclear from the article if they would ever be released.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin looked at the article for a long time, then pulled it from the larger bundle of the paper, folded it, and put it in his bag. The rest, he tossed into the bin, and he walked slowly through town, headed for Sieg.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin slid into the booth at the pub where Sieg worked. The other staff were somewhat familiar with him coming by, and it was a dead hour, four in the afternoon on a Thursday, so the dinner rush wouldn‚Äôt start for another hour at least. The restaurant was dark and quiet, and Sieg was sweeping out the area behind the bar‚Äî cheerful and industrious. His shift was almost over, which was why Martin was here. Often, Sieg would take a seat at one of the tables himself, and have some of the lunch food that was leftover as an early dinner, and then he and Martin would be able to spend the evening together. But Sieg hadn‚Äôt yet noticed him come in, and was whistling along to the warbling music on the speakers. Martin draped himself across the table, head on his folded arms, and watched him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took some time for Sieg to turn around and notice him, but when he did, his smile widened enough to brighten the room. He gave Martin a wave, then finished his tasks before he came over to sit down. Martin didn‚Äôt straighten up, but he did tilt his head so that he could smile up at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect to see you here,‚Äù he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy not? Isn‚Äôt your shift ending?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù Kircheis said. ‚ÄúI just figured you would be out walking all day or something. It‚Äôs cooler today than it was yesterday.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only so many places I can walk. I was at the library,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúAnd I wanted to come see you, and you told me yesterday that you were done around four today.‚Äù This made Sieg smile some more, which felt like a reward in some undefinable way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhat were you reading?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúSome plays.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOnes we can go to the city to see?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúNot likely,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúAnd I was reading the newspaper.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúLearn anything?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin lifted his head off the table finally, then pulled the folded stolen newspaper pages out of his bag. He spread the relevant one out on the table, and pointed to the relevant headline and small black and white photo that accompanied it: ‚ÄúRioters Arrested Outside Ministry of Justice.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg read the article very carefully before he commented on it. Martin watched his eyes flick back and forth, moving back up to the top of the article to study the picture. The figures in it were so small that their faces couldn‚Äôt be made out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt say what they were doing,‚Äù Sieg said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOf course it doesn‚Äôt. But there were only ten of them‚Äî that‚Äôs not a riot.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDo you know what they were doing?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThey were there for the court case that morning,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI think, anyway.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhose case?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThe deserter. Wasserman.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Sieg said. ‚ÄúI remember you told me about that.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin slumped back in the booth, sliding down so that his back was curled against the stiff pleather seat, and his chin was barely above the level of the table. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs tons of deserters, I bet,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI think they just have to pick one to make a real example of every once in a while. It‚Äôs too bad for them that they managed to pick one who would be able to make even average people sympathize with him.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúAnd what happens to the rest?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúQuietly shot, I guess,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúIf they let people know how many there really are, there‚Äôd only be more.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Sieg looked down at the paper. ‚ÄúDo you know any of these people?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúHow would I?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm a lot more adventurous than I am,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI just read things online.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúSomebody has to be the one putting things online.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúTrue.‚Äù Martin paused. ‚ÄúI hope I don‚Äôt know them. I might.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to happen to them?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in the newspaper, so they‚Äôll get made examples of too. Sympathy isn‚Äôt something that can be tolerated, I guess.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre apologizing.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDo you want to go?‚Äù Sieg asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice out.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin got the hint. He folded the paper back up and shoved it into his bag. Sieg yelled out to the manager behind the bar that he was headed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not having something to eat?‚Äù the manager asked. ‚ÄúI had Frank save you a plate.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI promised my mom I‚Äôd be back for dinner.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOh, we couldn‚Äôt disappoint the venerable Frau Kircheis,‚Äù the manager said. ‚ÄúHave a nice night, Siegfried.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThank you, sir.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They headed outside together. It was extraordinarily bright out, and Martin squinted into the sun. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs early for dinner.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to be home yet. Just by six.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúAlright, that‚Äôs good.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to come to dinner, by the way.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDo I need a reason to invite you?‚Äù Sieg asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin glanced over at him, then fell silent. They walked together for a while, out of the busier streets and down towards the river. It wasn‚Äôt in the direction of Sieg‚Äôs house, but they had a little bit of time to kill.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúHow many deserters do you think there are every year?‚Äù Martin asked as they walked along the river. The sidewalk was crumbling in places, and there was no handrail as it sloped down towards the turbid water. A few swans struggled to keep their place where the rapids met the shallows, poking their heads into and out of the water, then shaking themselves back up towards the calmer areas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Kircheis asked. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt ever hear a number. I don‚Äôt even know if I can make an educated guess.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThey probably report anybody who makes it away as having been killed in action.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúMost of them probably don‚Äôt make it, though,‚Äù Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúProbably not.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin kicked some pebbles down the dirt slope, watching them roll and plop into the river. Fish, thinking they were food, poked their gaping mouths above the surface of the water. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine what that would feel like,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúTrying to run, and knowing you won‚Äôt make it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚Äú</span>
  <em>
    <span>Do</span>
  </em>
  <span> they know that they won‚Äôt make it? You think they would do it even if they didn‚Äôt have hope at all?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYes, of course,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI would.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg turned to look at him. ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWell, everyone hopes they don‚Äôt have to,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know‚Äî I don‚Äôt think we have a choice.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúNo‚Äî I know what you mean. You do what you have to do.‚Äù Sieg looked across the river, away from Martin, though they were walking so close together that their arms brushed. ‚ÄúI just would want myself, or you, to feel like there‚Äôs hope, if it came down to something like that.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIs there?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúSome people get away.‚Äù Martin knew when Sieg said this, he was thinking of Reinhard von Musel, who had vanished to the other side of the galaxy years ago. He was the only data point either of them had, but his situation was much different than that of a military deserter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just talking about escaping the fleet,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI mean everything.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúSo do I.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were such an optimist.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I am. Maybe I want to be, or wish I was.‚Äù He smiled, not looking at Martin, but it was a rare expression of his‚Äî usually his face was either carefully neutral, or with his wide, crinkling smile. He was always genuine, but Martin rarely saw him look so bittersweet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIn what way?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I understand doing things just because they‚Äôre the only things you can do, but I would also want to think that a better world is possible.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúMaybe it is,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know for who.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúUs?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin laughed. ‚ÄúAnd what would that look like?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Sieg said. ‚ÄúYou tell me.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou have a better imagination than I do.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúCome on, Martin.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI just want to hear you talk about it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If it had been anyone else, Martin would have accused them of making fun of him. But this was Sieg, who had never been anything less than completely earnest with him. That was probably why Martin liked him so much. He thought about it, kicking rocks down into the water as they strolled along the riverside. It hadn‚Äôt rained in a while, so dust collected in slight indents in the path, and Martin‚Äôs feet stirred it up when he shuffled his way through them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think there have been good societies before‚Äî ones without war, people getting dragged off to secret courts and shot, or made examples of and shot in public.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù The answer didn‚Äôt seem to satisfy Sieg.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúSomeday, I think the Goldenbaum dynasty will fall,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúA world without kings‚Äî a world where there aren‚Äôt people on the frontier under the thumb of little lords‚Ä¶‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThat would be nice.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt sound enthusiastic.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really mean about that,‚Äù Sieg said. ‚ÄúI can already imagine that.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYour imagination is fine, then.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI meant just what you would want your life to be like.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg hadn‚Äôt meant the question to be a difficult one, but Martin found it hard to contemplate. It was another place where he was asked to imagine the perfect pressing up against the mundane‚Äî only he could imagine the perfect very clearly, and he didn‚Äôt like the discomfort of trying to superimpose it on his daily life. That always made it feel less real, less possible for people like him.¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter, does it?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt matters.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get to live it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWe could try to.‚Äù Sieg seemed very sad. ‚ÄúI would try to.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin stuffed his hands into his pockets. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd just want it to be like this,‚Äù he said after a moment. ‚ÄúWalking along the river. Just without ever having to worry about it ending. Without always having to leave when it gets dark.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn‚Äôt a good answer, but it made Sieg smile, though there was something behind his eyes that Martin couldn‚Äôt interpret. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep walking then.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou have to go home for dinner, you said.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Martin said. They kept walking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúTell me about the plays you were reading?‚Äù Sieg asked as they went.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI was working my way through the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Oresteia</span>
  </em>
  <span>,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI really enjoyed it. They‚Äôre tragedies, but you know what‚Äôs interesting?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThe notes at the front of the book said that these plays would all be performed in one day, a long saga where one happened right after the other. But at the end of the three tragedies, there would be a comedy‚Äî still written by the tragedian, but meant to be happy. The one that‚Äôs supposed to go with these is lost, though.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs too bad.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs the way things go. It wasn‚Äôt important enough to keep getting written down with the rest, so it got lost.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou should write one yourself,‚Äù Sieg said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin laughed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be good at it. I‚Äôve never written anything more than an essay.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt hurt to try.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThe comedy doesn‚Äôt fix the tragedy of the other plays,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt change anything.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it did.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThen why would you want to see it?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Isn‚Äôt it nice to have it anyway?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou must really think I need cheering up today. I don‚Äôt know why. You want me to imagine all kinds of happy endings.‚Äù He hadn‚Äôt meant it to be rude, but maybe it came out that way. Maybe Sieg was right, anyway. The news about Wasserman‚Äôs trial and the arrested protesters had certainly put him in a dire mood, at least when it came to politics, and Sieg was picking that up. But even still, Martin didn‚Äôt want to ruin the comfortable rapport he had with Sieg and wreck their evening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg hadn‚Äôt said anything, and was just looking at the river as they stood along the edge of the path.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs just keep walking,‚Äù Martin said. He pulled on Sieg‚Äôs elbow, which did make him smile again. Their shoulders bumped into each other every few steps while walking, but neither of them made any move to step further away. Sieg, the steadier one, was the one closer to the dangerous edge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked along the river until the path turned towards the street and the area along the river became train tracks. Sieg shoved aside some branches and helped Martin clamber over the fence in the most ungainly fashion, and then they walked along the train tracks. They could always find something to talk about, even if it was just Sieg calling his attention to some flowering weed growing up through the gravel next to the rails, or the song of some distant bird. Their shadows stretched out longer and longer behind them as they walked into the sunset. It was getting very late‚Äî past dinner time by several hours.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWe should get back,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll definitely get in trouble if you stay out all night.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúMy mother doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm sure she hasn‚Äôt really even noticed I‚Äôm gone.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg nodded, but Martin had to pull on his arm to get him to turn back towards town. It would be a long walk still‚Äî they had walked pretty far together, despite the train tracks making a wide curve all around town.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they approached the Kircheis house, Sieg asked, ‚ÄúAre you hungry?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou think your parents will give me dinner, after you stayed out late enough to miss the meal with me?‚Äù Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOf course they will.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúAlright. If you say so.‚Äù¬†</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They approached the Kircheis house. It seemed like all the lights were on, and all the windows were thrown open in the summer heat. Behind the house, the eerie glow of the lights inside the greenhouse illuminated the lower branches of some of the trees. They couldn‚Äôt hear any voices from inside, but Sieg‚Äôs parents were definitely home. He trotted up the steps and held open the door for Martin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin followed Sieg through the house, through the dining room into the kitchen. His mother was standing over the sink, her arms wet to her elbows in soapy water. Compared to her son, she was diminutive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI wondered where you went,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou know, I was frantic when you didn‚Äôt come home. I called the pub, I called the parents of every friend of yours I knew. No one knew where you were.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI was on a walk,‚Äù Sieg said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I lost track of time.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou could have called.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gotten into you, Sieg,‚Äù she said. She finally turned around and noticed that Martin was standing behind Sieg, his hands in his pockets. Her expression, which had been stormy, flattened out into one that looked eerily like Sieg‚Äôs practiced neutrality. This was so much worse than anger, Martin thought. ‚ÄúAnd this is who you were with?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIs there any dinner left?‚Äù Sieg asked. ‚ÄúCan Martin have some?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIn the fridge,‚Äù his mother said coldly. She rinsed off her hands, then stalked out of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin didn‚Äôt know what to say to that, or if he should say anything at all. Silently, Sieg got out the leftovers, some baked chicken and salad. He filled a plate for Martin, though Martin didn‚Äôt feel very hungry at all, even though they had walked for hours, and he hadn‚Äôt eaten anything since a granola bar and apple at lunch. They sat down at the dining room table across from each other. Neither of them spoke, so they could hear with crystal clarity the sounds of Sieg‚Äôs mother going upstairs and her muffled voice as she reported, ‚ÄúYour son is back home.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúSo is yours,‚Äù Sieg‚Äôs father said. His voice was just as placid as Sieg‚Äôs usually was, not a trace of anger in it. ‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt need to worry. He‚Äôs a perfectly capable young man.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mother‚Äôs response was inaudible, but the tone carried just as well through the too-hard closing of a door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Martin whispered. ‚ÄúWe should have gone back earlier.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. I wanted to stay out with you.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg just smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really understand why you‚Äôre doing this either,‚Äù Martin said, still whispering. ‚ÄúWhat is all this about, Sieg?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg just shook his head, and they quietly ate their dinner. Martin finished quickly, and Sieg abandoned his when Martin got up to leave, not wanting to be in the house with Sieg‚Äôs parents any longer than he had to be‚Äî it felt like he was only making things worse with his presence. Sieg followed him out the door, but when they reached the front garden, Sieg beckoned him around the side of the house, and let him into the greenhouse. Martin, rather confused, followed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The greenhouse was lit against the darkness, but it was impossible to see through the glass in either direction, since the windows were completely fogged up with steam. Sieg‚Äôs father grew tropical plants of all different varieties, and so they needed the water and heat, even in the middle of summer. Stepping inside was like stepping into a different world than Odin: the air was wet and tasted alive, and there was the sound of a rippling water fixture hidden somewhere behind the plants. It might have been just an ugly hydroponics system, but it sounded like a fountain. The plants were a riot of colors, every shade of the rainbow seemed to be represented there, if one pushed past the thick leaves that draped themselves over the narrow path through the raised beds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting very strange, Sieg,‚Äù Martin said. He sat down on the bench at the back of the greenhouse‚Äî concrete, but with the green beginnings of moss creeping up the lower edges of the legs. Sieg took the toolbox that was on the other side of the bench off and set it on the pebbled path floor, and sat down next to Martin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI wanted to talk to you,‚Äù he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been talking all afternoon. We talk every day.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Sieg fell silent, and Martin let him have his time to collect his thoughts, there in the quiet greenhouse with nothing but the sound of the water rippling somewhere. ‚ÄúYou said you thought I wanted to cheer you up, by imagining a happy future.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean for that to come out so wrong,‚Äù Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs alright.‚Äù Sieg smiled down at his feet. ‚ÄúI wanted to hear you talk about it. It was for me‚Äî not really for you. Sorry.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDid something happen?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve just been thinking.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you always?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWell, then.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúMartin‚Äî‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg was quiet again for a second. ‚ÄúI liked what you said, about being able to walk together forever.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin flushed, all the way up to his ears, though he couldn‚Äôt have exactly explained why. Luckily, the heat of the greenhouse was already making him sweat. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not possible, is it? The sun‚Äôs always going to have to go down.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had said something wrong again, he knew he had. ‚ÄúBut I liked walking with you until then,‚Äù Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI know. I did too.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin smiled, though he looked away, his eyes fixed on a bright red flower, the size of his hand, which dangled from a nearby vine plant coming down from the ceiling. ‚ÄúWell‚Äî I know that. But I‚Äôm glad. I don‚Äôt really understand why, though.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Siegfried stop whatever his train of thought had been. ‚ÄúWhat don‚Äôt you understand?‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúOh‚Äî you know.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg looked at him very strangely. ‚ÄúI admire you, you know.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand that either.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou understand the world, though. Better than I do.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt is. And you know what you want to do with yourself in the world. I admire that about you.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin looked over at him, but it was Sieg‚Äôs turn to look away, at the foggy glass and the invisible night outside. It was like this year round in here, Martin realized. He wondered if Sieg had a sense of that endless summer in the greenhouse, or if this had simply been a private place for them to have this conversation, whatever it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to think about the future,‚Äù Sieg said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for being grim about it earlier.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, though. That‚Äôs what makes it hard.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I could be wrong. You hope I‚Äôm wrong.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg smiled, that strange, bittersweet expression again. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúWhat is this about, Sieg?‚Äù Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg looked at Martin directly, meeting his eyes in a way that almost made Martin want to flinch. He didn‚Äôt, though. He stayed very still. Sieg reached forward and put his hand on Martin‚Äôs, on his knee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin suddenly understood what was happening, and what Sieg had been struggling to say. The understanding would have relaxed him, if it had not made his heart pound so strangely. But even if he couldn‚Äôt get his facial expression to be anything coherent, as he met Sieg‚Äôs eyes, he at least managed to curl his hand around Sieg‚Äôs and grip it tight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sieg smiled so brilliantly that it made Martin‚Äôs stomach flip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúCan I keep walking with you then?‚Äù Sieg asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúUntil the sun goes down?‚Äù Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúUntil then, and‚Ä¶‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‚ÄúYes‚Äî please‚Äî‚Äù</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Sieg leaned closer and closer to him on the bench, and Martin‚Äôs other hand tangled in his blood-red hair, and then they were kissing each other at last, there in the quiet, endless summer.</span>

          <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I was so close to writing a non WIAW piece‚Äî I had this somewhat elaborate plan for a really experimental Elfriede/Dominique interactive fiction piece, but then I procrastinated and ran out of time completely lol. So I went back to something that I‚Äôm much more familiar with. I figure you‚Äôll probably like this better anyway üòÖ. Martin is your little guy lol</p><p>(clearly, there is 0 point in me trying to respect exchange anonymity rn so I will not bother to do so)</p><p>Anyway, about this fic. Quite obviously, Martin‚Äôs arc is rapidly coming to an end, so this was a really good time to give him a bit of a sendoff‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs thematically connected in some ways both broadly to the ideas of WIAW as presented back in <i>Speaking In Tongues</i> and to a different short piece that I should have out in a couple days. (you‚Äôll see.) I think even though this is obviously backstory, it does work best right before the next section of <i>Serpent‚Äôs Mouth, Serpent‚Äôs Teeth</i> chapters‚Ä¶ but maybe i‚Äôm just biased in terms of feeling the writing order very intimately‚Äî the reading order of this series is really ‚Äòchoose your own adventure‚Äô</p><p>idk‚Ä¶ in WIAW, love is often very closely tied to grief‚Äî weddings and funerals often come in pairs in this story‚Äî so I thought that it would be interesting to play with that here again on a couple different levels. and i can never stop picking at the meta layer of the story haha.</p><p>the symbolisms are quite mutable‚Äî i‚Äôll just pick whatever i feel like works best in the moment. the joy of storytelling (for me) is in making connections anyway.</p><p>but of course when I read the Iliad, I have an enduring sympathy for Paris and Troy. I‚Äôve lived in two different Troy cities in my life, and my last name irl is of course not Rome ;) sometimes one does not choose the literature, the literature chooses you lol. but it was fun (‚Äòfun‚Äô) to imagine what ‚Äúthe Iliad as propaganda‚Äù would look like. picture <i>Ben Hurr</i>, but worse, I guess lol. The thing about Homer is that he goes to great lengths to humanize the dead in that story‚Äî amid the death there‚Äôs always a long litany of lineages and stories to accompany the names. That‚Äôs where the horror of war lives in the Iliad, but there‚Äôs a different kind of horror that would come from an adaptation that deliberately strips it out and dehumanizes the enemy.</p><p>anyway i really hope you enjoyed this little story! it was tricky to try to strike the balance of ‚Äòi am writing about eighth graders and high school freshmen‚Äô lol. i‚Äôm not entirely sure i succeeded but i did try my best.</p><p>thank you so much to Em for the beta read!</p><p>you all know where to find me lmfao</p></blockquote>
