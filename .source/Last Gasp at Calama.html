      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>When Thomas Barrow is medically discharged from the Imperial fleet, he has no desire to return to the backwater planet where his family lives. Running short on money and options, he is forced to ask his former employer, Lord Grantham, if he might return to service in his seasonal home in the capital planet of Odin. But things have changed since Thomas left service to go into the fleet, and he does not fit back easily into the old way of things. With a lesser position and new enemies, Thomas finds life on Odin difficult to bear.</p><p>Newly awarded the title of count, Reinhard von Lohengramm finds returning to the capital after being out in space intolerable. He wants nothing more than to be on his flagship, fighting the next battle, with Kircheis by his side. In contrast to that, the court on Odin is a pit of serpents, especially for the formerly middle class Reinhard, who is disliked by the majority of the nobility. When one of his few allies in court, the Baroness Magdalena von Westpfale, demands that he play the social game for his sister's sake, Reinhard reluctantly agrees and tries to join the court life.</p><p>The court season of 486 I.C., in the heart of the dying Galactic Empire, will be the last one of its kind.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>The lieutenant in charge of their rescue team was a blotchy faced man in his thirties, and he stood at the front of the shuttle, despite the pilot having yelled at him not two minutes before to stay in his seat, gods help him. He was shouting in vain over the angry thrum of the shuttle’s engines, holding on with one hand to the strap above his head, gesticulating madly with the other. His feet were hooked into the slats on the floor, but it didn’t seem like that was going to do much to stop him from falling over, should they get hit, or even make a sharp turn, for that matter. Thomas Barrow wasn’t paying much attention to the lieutenant from his seat near the back; he had tuned out the sound but was fixated on his fleshy lips moving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man next to him nudged him, then nodded to the tiny slice of window that they could see from their seats. “Looks like things are going well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what makes you say that,” Thomas said. All he could see was the carcass of an Alliance destroyer sliding past the window, the metal frames shoved outwards like broken ribs where the engine had catastrophically exploded. There was a part of his mind that was running the calculations: was there anyone left alive? What parts of the ship would they be trapped in? The engine was already blown, so the destroyer would be relatively safe to enter, for the rescuers at least. Probably not many survivors with a hit like that, though. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, as the man next to him said, they were winning, so there would be no rescue shuttles like his coming from the other side, dodging through the barrage of laser fire to latch themselves on to the side of the Alliance ship like a leech, cutting open the metal flesh, and sending in men to extract the life that remained. Anyone still alive in that destroyer either soon wouldn’t be, or would eventually become an Imperial prisoner of war. Thomas had to think that would be worse. It was bad enough being an Imperial soldier, he couldn’t think that prisoners of war were given any more of a light touch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their shuttle made a sudden, sharp twist and turn, pressing Thomas up and forward. If he hadn’t been suited up in his scuffed and stained white armor already, the restraints across his chest probably would have left gouges in his skin. As it was, he nearly dropped his helmet. According to procedure, they were all supposed to be wearing them already, but nobody wanted to, so it was customary to put them on right before the shuttle sawed open their route into their target ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lieutenant at the front was yelling louder now, though he was clutching his shoulder with a grimace-- it had been worth staying seated after all. An Imperial battleship swerved into view in the window and Thomas took notes: engine intact, but half of one side sheared away. Collision? It was bad that the engine hadn’t blown. Thomas didn’t want to be anywhere near this ship in case it was about to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Munich</span>
  </em>
  <span> class ship!” the lieutenant yelled. “We’re aiming for the fourth deck, port side. Everyone who could evacuate already did-- we saw the escape pods go out. This isn’t likely to be one where there’s an untouched group. Don’t try to go towards the starboard side-- there won’t be survivors there. Alpha-- you’re with me in engineering. Beta-- crew quarters, deck six and seven. Gamma-- command decks. Gravity is going to be fucked on this one-- do not come back if you feel it go-- it might not mean anything!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or it might mean that the huge gravity engine at the center of the ship was ticking over into instability. They just weren’t allowed to leave for the sake of their own lives: that would be too cowardly, after all. Thomas tried to stuff that thought down, knowing that he didn’t have a choice except to enter the ship. He figured somebody’d shoot him for refusing to go. He wouldn’t know; he’d gone every time before. Spaceman First Class Barrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He braced himself for the part of each one of these missions that he hated most, clutching the chest straps that held him down as their shuttle hit the bulk of the ship before them. He had seen other shuttles do this from the outside: the front end latched on like a mouth, and then a fiendish contraption of circling plasma cutters would strip away the shielded metal flesh of the larger ship, cutting a hole big enough that two people could step through abreast, ducking. From outside, it hardly looked like anything. From inside the shuttle, he could feel the impact as they stuck on, throwing him hard against his seat, and then the vibrations of that whirling mouth carried back through their shuttle like a scream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Helmets on, gentlemen!” the lieutenant yelled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, here we go,” the man next to him said with a sigh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The helmet tucked between his knees was ghastly. The eyes were sunken red holes in a white skull: a death’s head, for sure. It was intentional, of course. If such a terrifying visage could make a rebel soldier hesitate for even an instant, that was enough of an advantage to make it worth it. But as his fellows in the medical corps clicked their helmets into place, Thomas was surrounded more by dead men walking than he was by his peers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His own helmet settled around his head, the sweat-and-gunmetal scent of the shuttle replaced with the tang of filtered air. He couldn’t hear anything until the radio in his ear crackled to life, the sweaty lieutenant’s heavy breathing audible as though he was standing right at his shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s get in and get out on this one,” the lieutenant said. Now that there wasn’t the throb of the shuttle’s engines between them, Thomas could hear the anxiety in his voice clear as day. “Don’t go far from your group. If you lose signal, you won’t be able to hear the order to get out. Understood?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few people across the aisle from Thomas flashed the “acknowledge” handsign, not bothering to turn on their radios to verbally report back to the lieutenant. Even that acknowledgement was lackluster.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two minutes until we get this open. Form your lines.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hesitated in unclipping his harness, his hands suddenly not working under his control. The man next to him reached over and did it for him, then engaged his squad comms. “Come on, Barrow. There’ll be time to nap in your chair later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pushed himself to his feet, the magnetic feet of his suit hooking into the floor, allowing him to take dragging steps forward, forming a line, one body among bodies, ready to enter the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was near the rear, so he watched as groups of ten at a time pushed forward, squeezing into the airlock, and then vanished into the bowels of the ship. He came closer and closer to the front of the line, then he was in the crowded press of the airlock, radio chatter filling his ears without registering, and then he was stepping through the blistered hole in the ship, feeling gravity take hold of him and almost send him to his knees, and then he was moving, running forward, the way illuminated by only the red emergency lights in the smoke-filled corridor of the dead ship.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>He hadn’t been a soldier forever. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas often thought back to the day he had decided that he would become one. It had been a clear blue day, the kind of early spring that made him take the task of blacking His Lordship’s shoes outside, sitting at the rickety wooden table outside the kitchen’s back door, rag in one hand, shoe in the other, cigarette dangling out the corner of his mouth, looking up at the little white clouds shuffling their way across the sky. Any time the door opened behind him, he’d be furiously engaged in bringing the shoes to a mirror sheen, but there was plenty of time and no one needed him inside just yet, so he could dawdle, if he wanted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The talk at breakfast had been that His Lordship had finally agreed that it was time for his youngest daughter, Sybil, to take her first trip off planet, heading to Odin for the season. They would be going early this year, a month earlier than usual, to give Sybil time to get acquainted with the capital’s atmosphere before the season began properly. This disruption from the usual yearly routine was the kind of thing that made everyone talk around the servant’s table, not just upstairs. The house in the capital had a good number of its own staff, so it was a point of honor to be chosen to accompany the family from their country estate to the capitol on Odin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas had not yet had that opportunity, but this year... This year he was secure in the knowledge that he would. Lord Grantham’s valet’s father had fallen ill with something that was described as both tragic and terminal, and he had left abruptly the month prior, leaving Lord Grantham with no valet to speak of. Thomas, who had been first footman, was therefore the most eligible replacement, and had been serving in that capacity ever since.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Lord Grantham’s valet </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span> made the trip to Odin. He was indispensable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was looking forward to it. Thinking about everyone else rushing back and forth in the house, wondering if they would be among the lucky number, while he was sitting secure in his position, that was the kind of thought that put a smile on Thomas’s face, curling his lips despite the cigarette.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kitchen door banged open behind him. Thomas busied himself with the shoe polish instead of his daydreams about the bustling city life on Odin. He imagined there must be so many people there-- millions, billions even-- on the planet. Far more than the sparse, agrarian landscape that was the family’s duty to oversee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>O'brien, the lady’s maid to Lady Grantham, slid into the seat at the table across from Thomas. She had one of Lady Grantham’s bodices in one hand, and a huge ruffle of lace in the other, along with her sewing kit under her arm. Her face was as pinched and annoyed as ever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s all that, then?” Thomas asked. Seeing as it was only her, he put down his shoe polish entirely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Her Ladyship has decided that she does want to follow the latest trend in the capital after all, since we’ll be heading there right away.” She put the lace down on the table and brought her hand to her chest, wiggling her fingers outward to illustrate the ruffle that was to be added.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is the fashion to look like some sort of overgrown bird?” Thomas asked. “Maybe it won’t be so pleasant to go to Odin after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not like I ever get to wear much that’s fashionable over there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not so bad to get to see what they all wear upstairs. It’s a shame if it’s ugly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would like to look, wouldn’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas took a long drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke out across the table. “Not a crime to look, is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a crime to listen, either,” O’brien said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas looked up at her. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Talking might be a crime, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Out with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t like what I have to say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dangle whatever you heard over my head if you like,” Thomas said. He leaned back, trying to look relaxed and failing. “I’ll find out my own way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I doubt it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blew smoke at her again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Give me one of those,” she said, and held out her hand. Thomas fished around in his pocket for his last loose cigarette and passed it to her. “Light,” she demanded. The book of matches in his back pocket was almost empty, but he struck one and held it out to her so that she could light her cigarette, already between her teeth. Still, despite his </span>
  <em>
    <span>generosity</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she took a long, long time to say anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Grantham received a letter yesterday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You reading his post now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she said. “He was telling Her Ladyship about it, and I was in the room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know how he talks about his soldier-servant sometimes. From when he was in the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What of him?” Barnes or Bates or Bane or something-- Thomas couldn’t remember what the man’s name was. They had never met.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Apparently, he’s on Odin and looking for a job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s that got to do with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Grantham wants him for a valet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m his valet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not his valet,” O’brien said. “You’re the first footman, who’s filling in while he looks for a replacement.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s been satisfied with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Has he?” O’brien asked. “Or has he been putting up with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas narrowed his eyes. “I don’t believe you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Believe me or not,” O’brien said. “No skin off my back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And when was I supposed to learn about this?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I expect right before we were set to get on the ship to go to Odin,” she said. “His Lordship doesn’t want you to feel slighted and leave him in the lurch without a valet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how does His Lordship think I feel about that?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>O’brien just smiled grimly. “You can’t let on that I told you. Consider this information an early birthday gift.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a fine one,” he said, scowling. “What am I supposed to do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go back to your family for the summer, like you have been.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will not,” Thomas said. “I’ve been moving my way up in the world. I’m not going back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I suppose you’ll say you won’t go back to being first footman, neither.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Thomas said. “I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Better start asking Mr. Carson for a good reference now, then, before the whole family ups and leaves, and him with them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like it matters,” Thomas said. “No use for a reference around here. Nobody else looking for a valet on the whole planet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have enough saved to let a farm?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas laughed and stubbed the ashy end of his cigarette out against the table. “If I had that kind of money, you think I’d be hanging around here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay or go, I don’t care what you do,” she said. It was certainly a lie on some level-- Thomas was the only friend she had among the staff, and the reverse was true as well-- but she had to say it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll figure something out,” he said. “I always do.” He gathered up the shoes and polish and left without another word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All through the rest of the day, Thomas kept quiet. He was furious, of course he was, but one thing servants learned quickly was a perfect mask. If he hadn’t been able to keep himself under control while dressing His Lordship for dinner, he might have found himself without a job sooner than expected.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was after dinner, when Thomas was downstairs sitting at the table and reading the day’s paper, that Carson, the butler, came by. Several of the other servants were sitting as well, drinking tea or working on various petty tasks that could be done in the servants’ hall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have the evening post,” Carson said. “One for you, Anna, and” --he flipped through his stack of letters-- “one for Thomas.” He scrutinized the envelope more closely before holding it out to Thomas to take. “You didn’t inform me that it was your birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s it to you?” Thomas asked. “Didn’t think you’d be getting me a gift, Mr. Carson.” He took the letter. “And it’s next week, besides.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, happy birthday.” Carson’s voice conveyed the usual level of disdain. “You’ll need to speak with His Lordship to sort that out. Won’t want to have you missing when we travel for the season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Mr. Carson, we wouldn’t,” Thomas said, voice brutally dry. He took a closer look at the envelope that Carson had just given him. He was turning eighteen. This, then, was the standard notice informing him that he was being summoned for compulsory service in the Imperial fleet. University students automatically had their draft date deferred until they graduated, but Thomas was not in university, and so here was his notice, right on schedule.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anna looked over at him. “You’ll want to get that sorted right away,” she said. “They don’t joke when it comes to making you serve if you don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will,” Thomas said. But as he did, he caught O’brien’s eye from across the table. She raised a silent eyebrow, and Thomas stood, tucking the letter into his pocket and heading outside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The night was cool and dark, and Thomas bitterly wished he had another cigarette. He hadn’t been to town in too long, and had missed the chance to buy more. O’brien followed him out after a minute, and this time it was she who silently offered him a cigarette, lighting them both in her own mouth and passing it to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not thinking of going into the fleet, are you?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why should you care?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The only reason men work in this damn place is to get out of it,” she said. “Seems like a waste if you don’t at least take that piece of payment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, have His Lordship sign the piece of paper that says I’m vital to the functioning of the estate and can’t be spared even for a second.” Thomas took a drag on his cigarette. “I don’t know why anybody goes along with that stupid line.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because nobles like to feel so generous,” O’brien said. “And they like to have everything just so, and wouldn’t it be a shame if their valet went and got his head shot off in space.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t do it,” O’brien cautioned. “I doubt this soldier-servant His Lordship wants will last-- I’ll make sure he doesn’t come back here when the family’s done on Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re too kind,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not for your sake. I like things just so, too. And having a new valet when I’m the lady’s maid-- it changes things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what if you can’t make him go?” Thomas asked. “Am I to be shunted back to being a footman?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Put up with it for now,” O’brien said. “You’ll only make trouble for yourself if you don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What if I’m tired of putting up with things?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think there won’t be endless putting up with things in the fleet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A different sort. And a chance to advance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A chance to get yourself killed, more like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t care,” Thomas said. “I want to get off this planet. And if I can’t get to Odin with them” -- he jerked his head at the big house-- “I’ll do it my own way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t come crying to me when you get killed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t get killed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what they all say.” She took a drag on her cigarette. “I doubt it’ll be as pleasant as you’re imagining.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do you think I’m imagining?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I don’t know,” she said. “But I’d be careful, if I was you. And I’m glad I’m not you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas scowled. “Aren’t you the lucky one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All I’m saying is that if you think you’ve had to watch your back around here, I don’t think it compares to anything in the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you know anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That may well be,” O’brien said. “But I don’t suppose you know anything, either.” She dropped her cigarette to the ground and smashed it under her heel. “Don’t do it, Thomas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not your business what I do or don’t do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She just shook her head and walked back inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas said nothing about the letter to Lord Grantham, or anyone else, for quite some time. When he was finally told that he would not be leaving with the family for Odin, Thomas simply smiled and said, “That’s alright, Your Lordship. I’ve got my fleet papers served to me, anyway. So I’ll just answer that summons, then.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had to admit that he was gratified to see Lord Grantham’s mouth pinch at that.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thomas had been in the fleet for nearly two years, with some time left in his compulsory service still. He had been lucky, all things considered, as he had not yet been killed, at least. There had been some disturbingly close calls, the kind that made him wake up in his thin bunk, sweating and thrashing in his sheets. Everyone had those.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The time when his shuttle had been hit by laser fire had been the worst one, he thought. At least the closest he had ever come to dying himself. They were lucky it was only a sub-light engine in the shuttle, so when it was cleaved in half, taking off a slice of ship, all it had done was start a fire, and another shuttle had pulled course and grabbed all the survivors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A less fatal close call had been the NCO who had threatened him, not for anything he’d done, but just because-- well, some people had a sense of things. And Thomas stood out to those people, even if he wished otherwise. But that NCO had been transferred out to a different unit, taking his threats with him, and there hadn’t been any more of that trouble since.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Life in the fleet was almost unbearable, and it wasn’t one thing that made it so terrible-- it was everything. Hauling the dying out of ships that were about to blow was a difficult task, the kind of thing that most people wouldn’t volunteer for unless they were stupid. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas had been stupid, had thought that the medical corps would be an easy position. But he hadn’t known at all what it would be like.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He envied the crews of the big destroyers. They didn’t have any control over where their ships went, and if they were going to die, they wouldn’t see it coming. Someone who sat at a gun turret or a communications panel, they didn’t have to put one foot after the other, running deep into the guts of a ship, barely able to see through the smoke in the halls, the gravity warping and shifting beneath their feet, throwing them to the hallway wall or pulling them down to their knees, stepping over the dead on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His father had been a big believer in religion, talking about Valhalla. If this was a warrior’s paradise, Thomas had to wonder exactly what hell would look like, because he thought this might be it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The smoke was so thick in the ship’s hallway that Thomas lost sight of his group almost immediately. But he had this ship class layout memorized-- he could have made his way towards the command deck blind if he had to. Every door that still had power opened beneath his medical corps authorization, and those that didn’t, he had to pry open himself, straining with his full body to break the door seal, sending out a new rush of smoke each time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first, he was unsure where the smoke was coming from, because he saw no fire, but as he advanced deeper into the ship, more and more of the electrical systems had failed, and when he accidentally stumbled and put his hand against the wall, he could feel the heat of the burning cableways inside through his gloves. Smoke must be pouring out through every socket, every crack in the walls, every ventilation shaft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were very few people left alive, and those that were might not be for long. It took some time searching, but he found one person still living, laying on the ground, barely breathing with the smoke. He waited for a shudder in the gravity, making him and everything else briefly, momentarily, blessedly lighter, and pulled the dying man over his shoulder. The gravity swamped him again-- it was all he could do not to stumble to his knees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dragged himself, footstep by agonizing footstep, back to the shuttle, passed off the dying man on his shoulders to the medical team there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get going back in,” someone said, though he didn’t recognize their voice through the radio, nor could he see their face through his headset. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But the gravity--” Thomas said. The oscillations of it had been coming faster and faster, a sure sign that the engine was going to go, and take everyone who remained on board the ship with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s the order of the day,” the man said, and gave Thomas a shove on the shoulder. His tone hadn’t been cruel, nor had the shove been heavy, but that was an easy thing for someone who got to stay in the shuttle to say. If they thought the engine was going to go, they would not hesitate for a second to unlatch themselves from the ship, leaving everyone else behind to die.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas knew that first hand. He had been on the shuttle once, when that happened. Someone had given a two minute warning, and Thomas had dropped what he was doing and had sprinted, faster than he had ever run in his life, back to the shuttle. They had closed the doors right as he slid on board, and he knew, counting heads, that they had left a good twenty percent of their team behind. The ship had blown, two minutes after they had unhooked themselves from it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was a hard two minutes, he remembered. And he didn’t want to think about what it was like for everybody who hadn’t gotten back to the shuttle on time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tried to put that out of his mind, but it was difficult as he ran back in to the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t trust the lieutenant who was in charge of their group. He was antsy, the kind of man who wanted to look good to his superiors, more than he wanted to direct his team. That was the kind of officer who wouldn’t want to give a five minute call, enough for everybody to get out. That was the kind of officer who would only give a sixty second evacuation call. A thirty second call.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gravity throbbed beneath his feet. Thomas, distracted, stumbled and fell, knees and palms smacking the deck hard. It took far too much effort to drag himself back to his feet. Gravity swung again in the other direction, and his next step bounced him forward unpredictably.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This ship was not going to last.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But if Thomas ran back to the shuttle now, without a rescued body over his shoulder, he would-- well, he didn’t know what would happen to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another step forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was at the bridge, now, though it was barely visible through the smoke. Someone had already been through here, one of the other medical corps members; the door was open. Still, no one had tagged the door with the fluorescent mark that said the room was checked and clear, so Thomas went in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His weight shifted; he could feel it in his gut. It was fear made physical, that sensation of gravity changing. Nausea tugged at him, and he swallowed acid bile back down. He was sweating through his uniform, feeling it pooling around the joints of his suit. He wanted nothing more than to run back to the shuttle, but he dragged himself forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He saw the fire for the first time here, black-red through the heavy smoke, heat pressing down on him even through his suit. He imagined the white paint of his suit warping and bubbling with the heat. The wall of computer terminals between him and the command chair was ablaze, his path towards the dais where the captain usually sat blocked by structural debris that had fallen from above, bolts deformed by heat and pulled out by changing gravity. Much of that debris, too, was on fire, cables which traveled in the ceiling conduits now twitching like snakes as their heat-wrapped outer layers melted and constricted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Underneath all that debris, his legs trapped beneath a half crushed computer bank, his arm reaching out towards nothing, was a man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was dead already. Thomas could see that, as soon as he could tear his gaze away from his agonized face. He wasn’t breathing, at the very least. Thomas turned away. He doubted there were other survivors on the bridge, but he should check. But gravity throbbed again, harder and faster, and Thomas realized that there would be no time to look for other survivors. He had felt this type of thing before. This was the kind of throb that the engines gave when they were five minutes away from going.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it was paranoia. But he knew, would have sworn any oath, that if he wanted to live, he needed to get out, now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He would be shot if he returned without the order to return, and without someone slung over his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His gaze twitched back to the dead man on the ground, pinned beneath the burning rubble. He was a captain. They liked it when officers were rescued. He might even be a noble, for all Thomas knew. If he lied and said he had been alive when he started walking back to the shuttle-- pretended he died in his arms-- that would make him look a little more like a hero, and a little less like someone who was abandoning their post to get back to safety, wouldn’t it?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship groaned beneath Thomas’s feet. He could feel its death-scream in his bones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why wasn’t the lieutenant giving the call? Because he didn’t care if Thomas lived or died. Only Thomas cared about that. And he was going to die if he kept this up. If he kept being assigned under officers who didn’t know what they were doing, or even if they did-- it was luck, and everyone in the Imperial fleet had bad luck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He never wanted to do this again. They couldn’t make him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except they could, couldn’t they? It was this or court martial, and the execution for desertion of his post.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The captain was still lying dead on the ground, and Thomas was frozen, unmoving, pinned between the fear of the ship beneath him, and the whole fleet’s justice in the shuttle behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was envious of the people on this ship, the ones in the side that had been destroyed completely. They’d died before they had even known what hit them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t do this anymore. He realized, suddenly, that he would do anything to never have to do this again. Never have to run back in to a dying ship. Any bargain he had to strike, he would strike it. Any sacrifice he had to make, he would make it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That realization clarified the situation in his mind, swept away the fear and replaced it with a calculating certainty, a cold, blank feeling in his chest. He could hear his heartbeat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The captain was dead on the ground, and when gravity pulled Thomas down, he went down on his knees next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were wounds that a person could get that would discharge him from service. Not losing an arm-- if he lost an arm they’d give him a mechanical replacement. But if a man had enough damage to his limb without it being justifiable to cut it off, they’d send him home. It was burns, usually. The kind that required skin grafts. Those got a man out of service.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The captain was dead on the ground, trapped underneath burning debris.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His left hand trembled, acting like a creature with its own mind, as Thomas jammed it under the cable conduit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first, there was nothing. Then he could feel the heat, more and more intense. He had to look away, couldn’t watch the armor of his suit blistering and melting. It burned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the worst pain Thomas had ever endured, and he bit his tongue until it bled, holding his arm in the fire. It was the pain that meant he was going to live.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gravity threw him backwards, sending him sprawling onto his back. He couldn’t move his arm, even if he had wanted to. The joints in his suit had melted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas could barely think, or breathe, but he got to his knees. He grabbed the dead captain’s outstretched right arm. In the weak gravity now, it was easy enough to pull him, drag him, lift him by one arm, onto his shoulder, take steps down the smoke-filled hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He made it to the shuttle as the lieutenant, fleshy-lipped and sweating, called the fifteen second warning. Someone took the dead captain from his shoulder. With the weight gone, Thomas fell forward and it was someone else who had to drag him back towards the medical area, no one touching the char-black left arm of his suit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Thomas whispered, slumped against the shuttle wall, though he was glad no one could hear him through his suit. “Thank you for my deliverance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was going to live, and he was never, never going back into a ship like this again.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Ostensibly, Reinhard and Kircheis had been invited to Baroness Magdalena von Westpfale’s house to have dinner and celebrate Kircheis’s promotion to captain, but the force with which Magdalena had extended the invitation made Reinhard sure that this was not just a social visit. Nothing was ever </span>
  <em>
    <span>just</span>
  </em>
  <span> a social visit with Magdalena, though she would protest that statement, if Reinhard chose to say it aloud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had dressed up for the occasion, her dress shiny and black to match her hair, and the neckline almost dripped off her chest. She smiled impishly at Reinhard when he came in, and fluttered her fan in front of her face when she looked at Kircheis. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dinner itself was pleasant enough, which was what gave Reinhard a clue that Magdalena wanted to discuss something very serious after dinner. They could talk on at length about her visits to Reinhard’s sister, or Kircheis’s promotion, and Magdalena could be the world’s most charming hostess  while the servants were in the room, and nothing of substance could be spoken of. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard sometimes thought that Magdalena understood operational security far better than some of the higher echelons of the fleet did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After dinner, they moved into her library, with its dark furniture and walls of books that stretched up to the ceiling. Reinhard gave a mindless push to the ladder that circled the room on tracks to make the upper levels accessible, and it clattered away a few meters before coming to rest. Kircheis closed the door firmly behind them all, then stood awkwardly with his hands behind his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shall I get you something to drink?” Magdalena asked, flouncing over to the bar cart that had been set up. “Port, perhaps?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My sister would chastise you for trying to get me drunk,” Reinhard said. “You’ve trapped us both here to take advantage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena laughed. “I would like to, wouldn’t I? Is that a yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose I shouldn’t say no to your hospitality.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you, Sieg?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, thank you, Baroness,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She handed glasses to both of them, and then linked her now free arm with Kircheis’s, dragging him to take a seat next to her on the couch. It was a funny sight: he was more than a head taller than she was, but she moved with such surety that Kircheis didn’t have time to protest, only sparing a pained glance at Reinhard, whose mouth puckered as he sat on the armchair across from them both.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose it’s Kircheis you’re taking most advantage of,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t mind. Do you, Sieg?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis didn’t have a canned response to that, so he just smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What have you dragged us here to talk about, Baroness?” Reinhard asked. “We ought to be getting home-- I have a meeting with Fleet Admiral Muckenburger tomorrow, early.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena’s voice was almost delighted as she answered, “Oh, you’ve just done the work of bringing up several things that I would like to talk to you about. Forewarned is forearmed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure what you have to say on the subject of Fleet Admiral Muckenburger or morning meetings,” Reinhard said. “You’re certainly not in the fleet, and I wasn’t aware that you knew him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darling,” Magdalena said, “for one thing: I know everyone. And for another, don’t you think I would look absolutely thrilling in one of your fleet uniforms?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard took a sip of his port and said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sieg, agree with me that I would look good in uniform,” Magdalena demanded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis scratched his head, flushing as red as his hair. “I don’t think they would really fit you, Baroness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That would be no object.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness--” Reinhard began.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Count Lohengramm</span>
  </em>
  <span>. We’re in private now. It would kill no one for you both to call me Maggie. Gods know your sister does.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am not my sister.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More’s the pity.” Magdalena smiled. She cocked her head at him, her loose black hair catching the yellow reflected lamplight and shimmering with it. “I am sorry that I couldn’t arrange to have her here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand that my sister has constraints on her time,” Reinhard said, keeping the bitterness out of his voice. Of course, it was less that his sister was busy, and more that Reinhard was not allowed to see her, except with express permission of the Kaiser. Visiting her was his reward for victory in battle, these days. She was the leash that kept him tied to the Kaiser.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena had no such restrictions on visiting Annerose, as her friend, and so Reinhard did appreciate her willingness to act as a go-between, as well as her stories about how Annerose was doing and feeling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you’ll get to see her soon,” Magdalena said, consoling and surprisingly genuine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps.” Reinhard put down his glass on the side table. “What was it that you wanted to tell me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Three things,” she said. “But they are all wrapped up together, I’m afraid, so it won’t be easy to discuss any of them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s start with what you want me to know about Fleet Admiral Muckenburger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to be sent out to do battle again, soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s hardly secret knowledge,” Reinhard said. “It’s a fact of life in His Majesty’s fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re being schemed against.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness-- Magdalena,” Kircheis said, interrupting. “We are aware that Lord Reinhard has enemies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>We</span>
  </em>
  <span> are aware,” she repeated. “Here’s a question: how are your latest acquisitions to your little cadre of talent? Rear Admirals Reuenthal and Mittermeyer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard narrowed his eyes at her. “They are not part of your social circle,” he said. “I don’t know why you want to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Reuenthal didn’t tell you we had met?” She smirked at him. She was enjoying drawing out the suspense, but at least she sounded more amused than aggrieved about Reuenthal. He was a man with a bad reputation, but of all the women in the capital, Magdalena was probably closest to his match.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Reuenthal’s personal life is none of my concern,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena leaned forward, seizing on that. “Oh, I think it’s quite a lot of your concern, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What women he sees is no business of mine, even if you are among their number, Magdalena.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed. It was a charming sound-- the kind of laugh that made the listener know she had spent time practicing it in a mirror like an actress. It went on for just the right amount of time. Kircheis shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Let’s not pretend like we both don’t know what part of Reuenthal’s personal life I’m referring to. It has very little to do with women,” Magdalena said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Explain whatever your pet theory is to me, then,” Reinhard demanded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Must I be crass?” she asked. She was enjoying herself too much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that is what it takes for you to get to the point, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re no fun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should have invited someone else to dinner if you wanted a houseguest who is entertaining at parties.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed again. “Is he this funny when you’re alone, Sieg?” she asked, turning to Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Funnier, Baroness,” Kircheis said. His tone was dry, but he cracked a little smile at last.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She leaned back on the couch, throwing her arms across the back of it. Reinhard kept a close eye on the hand that trailed near Kircheis’s back, but she didn’t touch him. She saw his look and she smiled, a smug, secretive expression as she met his eyes. “Now, Lord Reinhard, we both know that you loaned Reuenthal your aid, and your sister’s influence alongside it, because you have certain things in common.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I agreed to help him because he said that he and Mittermeyer could be useful to me. I believed him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, you don’t think I would judge you for being sentimental, do you?” Reinhard was silent, so she turned to Kircheis. “Sieg, did it tug the strings of your heart to see the high-and-mighty Reuenthal plead for help on behalf of-- well--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know all of this?” Reinhard interrupted, cutting her off to rescue Kircheis. He was done with the game.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He keeps a photo of Rear Admiral Mittermeyer on his bedside table,” Magdalena said curtly. “I wouldn’t have known if I hadn’t seen that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And he let you see that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I went snooping,” she said. “And then he kicked me out of his house.” Her tone changed to something a little less manufactured. “Actually, maybe don’t mention to him that I’m talking to you about this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why are you talking to me about this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because, Lord Reinhard, Herr von Reuenthal is capable of being discreet. But he came to you for help because you are not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard scowled and said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lucky that Reuenthal only was taking advantage of your sympathy,” Magdalena said. “But it’s only a matter of time before someone takes objection to your, shall we say, lifestyle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness,” Kircheis said, “I believe there are more pressing things that people object to about Lord Reinhard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed and leaned her head on Kircheis’s shoulder. “Of course. But you and I both know that the Kaiser isn’t going to live much longer, and after that, you will lack certain protections.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need the Kaiser’s protection,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena sat up straight and crossed her arms. “Put your pride away for one second, and listen to what I’m telling you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not telling me anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right now, the only way that people are allowed to try to kill you is by sending you into danger in the fleet. I don’t doubt that you’ll survive, gods know you’re good at what you do, but there are other ways that people can make your life miserable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you say so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As I said, people are already scheming against you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have details, or is this a generalized warning? I don’t need the latter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have details,” she said. “When you go out at the end of the year, heading towards a battle that everyone thinks is unwinnable, you will not have any of your top staff with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any?” Reinhard asked, his eyes widening, looking at Kircheis, who frowned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aside from Captain Kircheis,” Magdalena said. “I’m sure it’s with the intent to kill the both of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Reinhard relaxed, smiling, and waved his hand. “Reuenthal, Mittermeyer, and Captain Mecklinger can all enjoy their vacation, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t be quite so glib, if I were in your shoes, but I’m glad you think it’s no issue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As long as no one causes trouble for them on Odin while I’m away, I don’t think it matters.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably no one will,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And who arranged this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duke Braunschweig and Baron Flegel,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course it was them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d appreciate if you didn’t let anyone know I had given you this information.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand operational security as well as you do,” Reinhard said. “Though clearly Baron Flegel does not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t know how to keep his mouth shut,” Magdalena said derisively. “It’s not an attractive quality in friends, but it’s a useful one in enemies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate the warning,” Reinhard said. “Was that all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That wasn’t even what I wanted to talk to you about,” Magdalena said. “It was just to get your attention.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m listening,” Reinhard said. “If you’ll stop drawing out the suspense, that is. I really do have an early meeting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You, of all people, don’t need beauty sleep,” Magdalena said with a huff. “But very well, I’ll be blunt, if that’s what you want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you’ve gotten lucky,” Magdalena said, her tone quite serious now. “Flegel and his company have thought that it’s easier to kill you and Sieg together, and rid themselves of both problems at once. But, sooner or later, they are going to realize that a far more devastating blow would be to separate you from him, by one means or another.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard met Kircheis’s eyes. “Kircheis is perfectly capable of protecting himself from the likes of Baron Flegel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not listening to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard silently stared at Magdalena and waited for her to continue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What I mean is that it’s not just going to be Baron Flegel and his ilk, now that you’re really part of the court. Now that you have a title.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t see how that changes things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It does,” Magdalena said. “Before, they hated you because they hated your sister, for her position in the Kaiser’s life. Now that you have proven yourself in the Kaiser’s eyes, they are going to hate you on your own merits. And I’m not just talking about petty grudges with Flegel because you were rude to him at a party, or anything like that. You’re going to have the whole of the court against you if you don’t behave in ways that they like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a dancing act. I don’t care what the court thinks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I just can’t with you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said. Reinhard looked sharply at him, and Kircheis’s small smile made him drop his defensiveness, at least a little. “Baroness Westpfale is right: it will be more difficult to protect your sister, and accomplish what we need to, if we have no allies in the court.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Thank</span>
  </em>
  <span> you, Sieg. I’m not suggesting you become a slave to the fashion, as it were, but you need to think about the allies you can find outside the fleet. The fleet is all well and good, but it doesn’t run without money and support from the nobility.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how do you expect me to change the court’s opinion?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have to become one of them, I’m afraid. They hate status seekers, but they at least understand them. Someone like yourself who acts indifferent to status is like an invading germ-- the court’s immune system will drive you out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard frowned. “And what changes do you expect me to make?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s start with the easiest. Number one, you must start signing your personal correspondence as </span>
  <em>
    <span>Count</span>
  </em>
  <span> Lohengramm, rather than </span>
  <em>
    <span>Admiral</span>
  </em>
  <span> Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t the name enough?” Reinhard asked. “Not that I had any attachment to ‘Müsel’, but one would think that taking a distinguished name would satisfy people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Magdalena said flatly. “There’s a reason that generally only younger sons go into the fleet: it’s a far lower tier of respectability, but if one doesn’t inherit, it’s the only title one can hope to earn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The fleet is the great equalizer of classes, is it?” Reinhard said, voice dry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena laughed. “You know that is not the case. But this is an easy concession to make. Just start making it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you insist. What else do you want me to change about my </span>
  <em>
    <span>lifestyle</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena smiled and leaned forward to pick up a pad of paper and pen sitting on the coffee table between them. As she scribbled something in her elegant but carefree hand, she said, “You haven’t just inherited a title: you have an estate, as well. Even if you won’t manage it directly, you can’t let it and the money languish. This is my lawyer. He will be expecting a call from you, and he can explain to you exactly what needs to be done to manage your property. If you do not call him, I will be very displeased.” She ripped off the top sheet of paper, and handed it to Reinhard. He glanced at the name-- Matthew von Crawley, then folded the paper and tucked it into his breast pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” he said. “I’ll speak with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And on the subject of your estate, one part of it is a lovely home in the capital.” She paused, waiting expectantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You need to move out of Linbergestrasse. It doesn’t make sense for a count to be a tenant in someone’s rented flat.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That will be a pain,” Reinhard said. “Kircheis--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will need to move there without Kircheis,” Magdalena said. “You can’t keep living together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reinhard snapped. “I shall not. We’ve lived together for almost a decade, and I see no reason for that to change.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was different when you were not a count,” Magdalena said. “A schoolboy or a soldier can have a roommate. It makes sense to split rent money when you do not have money. But a count cannot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not asking you to never see each other,” Magdalena said. “I’m asking you to bee a little more circumspect. That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t care what you’re asking. I will either move into the new house with Kircheis, or I will remain at Linbergstrasse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighed. “Think about it, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena had spoiled any good mood that Reinhard had. “Was there any other part of my life you wanted to upend? Are you going to tell me to resign my commission and retire from the fleet, next?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked at him with a surprisingly sympathetic expression, but this only made Reinhard frown further.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to get you invited around to places,” she said. When Reinhard opened his mouth to protest, she held up her hand to forestall him. “I don’t care if you do not like the court. You need to become familiar with it. You will make your rounds,” she said. “For Annerose’s sake, if not your own.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard stood, which caused Kircheis to stand, as well. “If that is </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Baroness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Think about what I said, Lord Reinhard,” Magdalena said. “This is my world, and I know how to navigate it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will think about it,” he said, very grudgingly. “Goodnight, Baroness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena stood, looked at him for a second, and then embraced him. “Goodnight, Lord Reinhard.” She turned to Kircheis. “And goodnight to you, as well, Sieg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for the lovely dinner, Baroness,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed. “I’ll tell my cook that you enjoyed it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their rented flat on Linbergstrasse was quiet and cozy, with the fire low in the hearth. Their landladies were well asleep by the time that Reinhard and Kircheis returned, sneaking up the stairs back into their own domain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Honestly, I do not know what my sister sees in that woman,” Reinhard said as he divested himself of his jacket. “She does not know how to stay out of other people’s business.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That can be a helpful thing to have in a friend, Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said, pulling off his own cravate. “She means well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t tell me she’s convinced you to move out of here,” Reinhard said, scowling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe she intended that I move. Only you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard turned away, stalking towards the windows. “I don’t care what the court thinks of me. If they hate me, all the better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should ask Lady Annerose about it, next time you see her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What good will that do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If she believes that Baroness Westpfale is correct, I think we could put up with the inconvenience of living apart, for a little while, at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard’s scowl softened when he saw Kircheis come up behind him, in the warped reflection in the windowpane. “Until we take the universe?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Until you have enough power that no one can touch you,” Kircheis said. “Then we won’t have to care what other people think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t care.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not in that way,” Kircheis said. “But Lady Annerose would appreciate me thinking about how to keep you safe-- from the court as well as the rebel fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s stooping to their level,” Reinhard said. “To bow and play the game by their rules.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It won’t be their rules for much longer, Lord Reinhard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard smiled. “No, I don’t believe it will be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you go see that lawyer about the estate?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should, shouldn’t I? I’ll give him a call tomorrow, see if he can fit me in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Baroness Westpfale told him to expect you, I’m sure he can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“True.” Reinhard stared out the window at the dark garden below. “You don’t want to leave me, do you, Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis’s answer was to wrap his arms around Reinhard, bury his nose in Reinhard’s sun-bright hair. “You should get to bed. You’ll be in a terrible mood if you don’t sleep well before you see Muckenburger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard turned, difficult still enclosed in Kircheis’s arms. “Damn Muckenburger,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis smiled, his eyes crinkling shut, and Reinhard tugged on his curly red hair, bringing his head down so that they could kiss, his back against the window.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>A few days later, Reinhard met the lawyer that Magdalena had recommended in his office. It was a well kept place, bustling with activity, and the receptionist was very obsequious to Reinhard when he arrived at the door in his uniform, saying he had an appointment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lawyer who came out to meet him was stocky man about Reinhard’s height, with a gregarious, round face underneath light brown, swept back hair. He extended a hand to Reinhard to shake. “Admiral Lohengramm, it’s an honor to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since it was Baroness Westpfale who recommended me your services, and I’m not here on fleet business, I’d have thought everyone would insist on calling me ‘Count,’ Herr Crawley.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Old habits die hard,” Matthew said. “I feel like I would be chewed out by my CO to address him by anything other than his rank, even if we were to meet on the street these days. Right this way, sir.” He led Reinhard into his office, which was brightly lit and comfortably full of books and other paraphernalia of the lawyer’s trade. They both sat across from each other, with Matthew’s heavy wooden desk between them. Reinhard felt unexpectedly out of his element.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were in the fleet?” he asked, by way of orienting himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I served on a ship called the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Blue Danube</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” he said. “Only ever went as far as lieutenant, but that was plenty for me. I don’t think it would have suited anybody assigned under me if I had advanced further-- it wasn’t really my strong suit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard nodded. “Some people never recognize that about themselves. It does you credit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I almost didn’t-- I might have stayed in if my mother hadn’t begged me to come home after my tour was up,” he said. “You know how mothers are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid mine died when I was very young,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew blanched. “My condolences, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard waved his hand. “I hardly remember her. My sister practically raised me.” To spare Matthew from further embarrassment, he said, “I haven’t had to deal with this inheritance business before. When my father died, there was nothing left, so I’m glad to have someone recommended to walk me through it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Certainly, sir,” Matthew said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know the Baroness Westpfale well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A purely business relationship,” he said. “My firm had served her father, the Baron Westpfale, and he died just as Herr Fellenburg was retiring. I was very pleased when the baroness asked me to overlook her estate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any particular reason she chose you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t possibly say,” Matthew said. “She may have just wanted to choose a younger solicitor, so that she wouldn’t need to go through the trouble of replacing an older one who would retire in ten or fifteen years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s shrewd,” Reinhard said. But he suspected that Magdalena may have chosen Matthew for a certain innocent and good-looking charm that he had about him. That was the kind of thing that Magdalena tended to like. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume you don’t have much time to spend going over the details, Count Lohengramm, so when Baroness Westpfale said that you were intending to take me on, I took the liberty of gathering some of the relevant details about the estate you’ve inherited. I hope you don’t mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at all. Though I don’t have anything booked for the evening,” Reinhard said. “I expected that being thorough here would take a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Matthew said, sounding pleasantly surprised, “there’s still no reason to delay getting started.” He reached over to his computer and turned it on, pulling up some documents on the second monitor to show Reinhard, who looked at them with his usual exacting stare. “I thought a good place to start would be with the land. It’s on the planet Helmuth, and has been overseen by a crown-appointed steward since the Lohengramm line died out…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard appreciated Matthew’s exactitude-- for all that he had said he hadn’t been a good officer in the fleet, Reinhard found that hard to believe: he suspected he would have made an excellent staff officer. It may have just been humility on his part, or a lie to excuse his leaving the fleet. Reinhard put those thoughts away as he listed to Matthew go over the details of the estate he had inherited. The land, the people who lived on it, the money, the various properties on Odin, and all the rights and responsibilities that being a count-- it was all new, and felt tedious. But he paid attention anyway, asking incisive questions that made Matthew raise his eyebrows each time. If Reinhard was going to do something, he was not going to do it halfway, or leave a task to someone else without understanding it. He had no desire to have some other noble scam him through misunderstanding the ways that noble society functioned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew’s secretary brought in coffee for the both of them while they were absorbed in the minutiae, but they finished their business before they finished the coffee. Since the sun had slipped past the window long ago, Reinhard had lost track of time, so didn’t mind sitting a little while longer to finish his drink before he made his way back home. Kircheis would be pleased that he was taking it seriously, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, Admiral Lohengramm,” Matthew said, “quite aside from being happy to be your solicitor, I’m happy that you’ve given me the opportunity to get some first hand experience dealing with the inheritance of an estate this size.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you not have to for Baroness Westpfale?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was somewhat less involved,” he said. “Her father had already sorted out most of the details, and a barony is smaller than a county.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard nodded. “I’m happy to provide the experience, I suppose. If you find such things fascinating.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew laughed, and shuffled some of his papers into a neat stack. “Not particularly,” he said. “It’s my career, but not really my passion. But it’s funny-- if I dare say so, we’re in similar positions, Admiral Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In what way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a few weeks ago, I received notice that a cousin of mine had died, and that I am now next in line to inherit the title of Count Grantham.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Congratulations,” Reinhard said. He didn’t particularly care, but it didn’t hurt to be polite. “Was that expected?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at all,” Matthew said. “I wasn’t aware that I was even in the line of succession. I was perfectly content to spend the rest of my life solidly middle class, and I had to go and get a letter that tells me my whole way of life is about to be upended.” He laughed. “But that’s the way things go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose it is,” Reinhard said. “Are you going to inherit soon?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m certain I won’t. The current count, Lord Grantham-- he’s my third cousin once removed-- he’s only in his sixties. I don’t expect I’ll inherit for at least twenty years. That’s why Baroness Westpfale encouraged me to take your case. She thought I would still have plenty of time to work on it before I became wrapped up in my own responsibilities.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m beginning to think that it’s more likely that Baroness Westpfale was trying to engineer us to find this commonality, and become friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t presume, Admiral Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard smiled. “I wouldn’t worry about presumption, especially when it comes to the baroness and her schemes. She is a clever devil. I expect you, too, will have to spend your free time being shuffled between social events, now that you’re an heir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew smiled. “I don’t know how well I’ll fit in at such things. I am terribly middle class.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So am I.” Reinhard finished his coffee. “If we end up trapped in any of the same parties, it will be good to have someone I know. I find some of these social events unbearably tedious.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to be spending quite a lot of time at Lord Grantham’s estate in the capital,” Matthew said. “Would it be presumptuous for me to ask Count Grantham to invite you, should we hold any sort of social event?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure Baroness Westpfale is banking on it,” Reinhard said. “If you’re looking for an ally to raise your image in the eyes of the old guard, I’m hardly the right choice for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The most successful admiral of the Reichsflotte wouldn’t be a good choice to bring to a party?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Crawley, I think you’re about to find that there are few people more hated in the eyes of the court than myself and my sister. It may be that Baroness Westpfale wants me to associate with you to raise my status.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew laughed. “Is that you telling me not to bother to be social with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can invite me,” Reinhard said, though he was sure the tiredness showed in his voice. “Though I somehow doubt it will help either of us, no matter what Baroness Westpfale thinks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excellent,” Matthew said. “I am sure Lord Grantham would be happy to have you-- and his daughters, I’m sure, would love to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard forced a smile onto his face. “You’re very kind, Herr Crawley.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew glanced at his watch, then made a face. “My mother was expecting me for dinner over an hour ago. I probably should have telephoned her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard stood. “I’m very sorry to have held you up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, don’t worry-- I hope I didn’t keep you from anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My own dinner will be waiting, I’m sure,” Reinhard said. He extended his hand. “It was a pleasure, Herr Crawley. I look forward to seeing you again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Likewise, Admiral.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>Every year, it seemed as though the trip to Odin for the season came with more chaotic of a departure for the Crawley family than the last. Sybil didn’t mind the excitement, not in the least. Among her sisters, she was always the fastest to pack, not feeling the need to hem and haw over every last detail like Mary and Edith did. She was simply picking dresses from her wardrobe at random, chatting with Gwen, the housemaid who was helping her, the whole time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so excited,” Sybil said. “I had a letter from Maggie-- Baroness Westpfale-- this morning. She said she wants to take me out on the town as soon as we get to Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very exciting,” Gwen said. “Are you taking this one?” She held out a green dress, one with delicate little beaded flowers festooned across the chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes. I forgot about that one.” Sybil said. She took it and held it up to her petite frame in the mirror, looking at the way the green stood out against her dark hair. “How many more should I take, you think?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, m’lady. You don’t want for space in the trunks, that’s for sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But if I bring too many, I won’t have an excuse to go shopping when we get there.” She grinned, and Gwen tentatively smiled back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is the fashion really so different on Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think it depends on what you call different.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘Suppose if I went with you, I’d still be in uniform,” Gwen said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shame not everybody gets to come,” Sybil said. The disappointment in her voice was genuine, but Gwen shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t mind. I don’t know if I could bear going on a ship like that,” Gwen said. “Not after what happened to His Lordship’s cousin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil frowned. “It’s perfectly safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope so, m’lady. But you’re more adventurous than I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe next year, I’ll ask Frau Hughes if you can come with us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no, I couldn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, alright.” Sybil sat back down on her bed and leaned back on her arms, staring up at the canopy ceiling. “You’d like Odin, though. Everything in the universe happens there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When I’m old enough that Mama won’t make a fuss, I want to live there, not just go for the season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When will that be, m’lady?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil laughed. “When I’m sixty-two, maybe. Aunt Rosamund lives on Odin, so I don’t see why I couldn’t someday. But Mama wouldn’t want me to be so far away. She won’t even want me to go out to see Maggie. I’ll have to find a way to escape secretly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very exciting,” Gwen said. “You like Baroness Westpfale?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Love</span>
  </em>
  <span> her,” Sybil said, rather dreamily. “She’s so… vivid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did you meet her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When I came out,” Sybil said. “She was at Neue Sanssouci that night, and introduced herself. She knows Mary and Edith, too. I think they’ve seen each other at parties for years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How old is she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mary’s age, I think?” Sybil said. “Not old, anyway. Why do you ask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was just wondering-- she’s married?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no. At least not last time I saw her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t really understand, m’lady,” Gwen said. “She’s a baroness? But Lady Mary isn’t going to be able to inherit His Lordship’s title.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that,” Sybil said. “If the title, back in the line, was given to a lady first, women can inherit it. The first Westpfale must have been a woman. But the first Count Grantham was a man, so… Poor Mary. Doesn’t really seem fair.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gwen nodded, then held up another dress from the wardrobe. “This one, m’lady?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I don’t know. What do you think?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pink suits you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then sure, I’ll take it.” She grinned at Gwen, who smiled back, and laid the dress on the neat pile to come with her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They continued to talk for a little while longer, until the set of outfits to bring along had been narrowed down into what would fit in just a few trunks, and Gwen called one of the footmen to help carry them away. Sybil slipped out down the hall and headed for Mary’s room, knocking and then leaning on the doorframe when Mary said she could come in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anna, the head housemaid, was with her, picking through Mary’s jewelry to decide what to take. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You finished packing first, I see,” Mary said, holding some earrings up to her ears and contemplating her reflection in the dressing table mirror. “It’s not as though doing it faster will make us leave sooner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Sybil said. “But I didn’t see any need to wait. I am excited, even if you’re not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m excited,” Mary said. But it was in that above-it-all tone she usually had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could stand to act like it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re not going to Odin to jaunt around,” Mary pointed out. “At least </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m</span>
  </em>
  <span> not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t tell me you can’t have a little fun, even if you are going to have to find a husband.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure that process will be fun in its own way.” She put the earrings back down. “I’m interested to try it, at least, though I expect Mama and Papa both will give me about as much choice in my next suitor as they did for my last one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil just rolled her eyes and came in to sit on the bed. “There were reasons for them wanting you to marry Patrick.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m well aware,” Mary said. “But I went along with it before because I was younger. I don’t think I’ll do the same again if they want me to marry the new heir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do they?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you think the thought hasn’t crossed their minds, you’re fooling yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have we ever met him?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have, years ago. Didn’t leave much of an impression on me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hunh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could start looking yourself, you know,” Mary said. “You’ve been presented at court, so you’re perfectly eligible. And there’s nothing holding you back like--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, don’t be mean to Edith, Mary,” Sybil said. “I think she’s perfectly beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have a generous imagination.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think we’ll be on Odin until at least you find some prospects, so I’m not in any rush,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t recommend you wait on me,” Mary said. “Urgency always makes me drag my feet that much more.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like with packing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not making me go any faster.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t trying to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anna, who had been listening as she carefully wrapped some of Mary’s chosen necklaces in tissue paper for the journey, gave Sybil a small smile, and Sybil grinned back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to wonder what the social calendar is going to be like when we arrive,” Mary said. She fished around for something in her jewelry box, but it was clear that she was just looking for something to do with her hands. Sybil kicked her heels against the side of Mary’s bed. “Granny will probably take it upon herself to parade me around the town.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You love Granny.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love being a show pig rather less, I’m afraid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow, Sybil wasn’t sure that was true. “Well, if you don’t want to go out quite as much, you should convince Papa to host some sort of event.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gather all my potential suitors in one place and have them joust for my attention?” Though Mary’s voice was dry, the idea had clearly caught her attention. “Perhaps.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who would you invite?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should think of who </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>want to invite,” Mary said. “We’re all going to have to get married. It’s not like the money Papa has set aside for us will last very long if we don’t. We’ll all have to manage it somehow. Even Edith.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even Edith what?” Edith said, coming to stand in the open doorway. Mary grimaced.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You finished packing, Edith?” Sybil asked, turning to smile at her other sister. While Mary managed to make her mourning black dress look chic, Edith’s dour outfit only made her face look paler and her eyes wider above her large nose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll go back to it later,” she said. “It’s almost time for tea.” She looked over at the open trunks where a few of Mary’s dresses had been neatly folded already. “Are you really bringing those?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why wouldn’t I?” Mary asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should be in mourning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The period will be up by the time we get to Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not for a fiancee.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We weren’t engaged, not really.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s like you didn’t care about him at all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know why it should matter to you,” Mary said. “It’s not as though you had any intention of marrying him.” Mary wasn’t even looking at her, and was back to looking at her jewelry in the mirror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edith’s expression darkened for a moment, but she composed herself and said, “It all seems rather callous. Like you wanted to get rid of him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wanted? I certainly didn’t bribe the pirates to attack his ship,” Mary said. “What I wanted with regards to Patrick hardly seemed to matter, since the whole matter was settled when I was about six years old.” She dropped her hands to the dressing table. “It would certainly look odd for me to be in mourning while the rest of you weren’t, since nobody but family even knew we were intending to marry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you were intending. It seems cruel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Patrick can hardly be bothered by it, at this point.” She turned in her chair. “I loved him as a cousin; I’ll mourn him as a cousin. I don’t see how that couldn’t satisfy you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Edith,” Sybil said. “Everyone on Odin looks so bright all the time, you can hardly expect Mary to--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Patrick had been </span>
  <em>
    <span>my</span>
  </em>
  <span> fiancee--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, he wasn’t. So I don’t see why you should care.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t be able to turn around and look for someone else to take his place quite so fast as you seem to want to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Luckily, you don’t have grief to delay your attempts to find a suitor,” Mary intoned. “You’ll need all the time you have, and I don’t think getting older will do you any favors.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mary!” Sybil exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edith turned up her chin. “You think it’ll be so easy for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What should it matter whether it’s easy for me or not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I know what your plan is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what’s my plan?” Mary picked up a hairpiece and held it against her dark hair. It sparkled in the light coming through the window. “I think I will take this one, Anna,” she said, and handed it over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No one would want to marry you if they knew you weren’t going to have any inheritance other than your dowry and what Papa’s leaving for you. But I don’t think it’s right, to pretend like you have the money.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who says I’m going to pretend anything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama told me not to let that slip. Did she tell you, as well, Sybil?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Afraid you were going to stab me in the back, was she?” Mary asked. Edith was silent. “But it wouldn’t matter if you did. I shouldn’t think I need the promise of Mama’s fortune to find a husband.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll have to rely on looks, since your personality won’t do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Edith, come on,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s more than you have to rely on,” Mary said. “So I suppose I still have the advantage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edith made a disgruntled noise and turned on her heel, heading out of the room. “I’m heading down to tea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she had gone, Mary looked over at Anna, who had been silently following the exchange. “What’s got her so bothered?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No idea, m’lady,” Anna said, though her usual patience was clearly wearing a little thin. “But she’s right that it’s teatime.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary sighed. “Very well.” She gave one last lingering touch to a broach laid out on the desk. “I suppose I will be glad to get to Odin. There’s more places to go to get away from each other, at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not if Granny brings us all around to dinner at every house with an eligible gentleman in it,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary laughed. “Oh, Granny should know better than to bring the both of us together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could try to get along, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We do get along,” Mary said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil just shook her head and rolled off the bed onto her feet. “Come on,” she said, holding out her hand. “Let’s see how Mama’s doing with her packing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The whole Crawley household arrived with a great hustle and bustle to their family home on Odin in the middle of the local night, after an interminable journey aboard a merchant passenger ship that they had chartered. As usual, Mary grumbled that they should buy a ship of their own for the family to use, but Edith had told her that she should just marry the richest man that she could find, and then she could buy whatever spaceship she pleased. This usually sent Mary into a tiff. Tensions ran short, and by the time they set foot on solid ground on Odin, Sybil was anxious to get as far away from the both of them as possible, tired of being the go between and the only reasonable one. If they had arrived back at their estate in the middle of the day, Sybil might have excused herself to go on a long walk of the grounds and re-acquaint herself with them, but as they came past midnight, and with all the lights and noise and going in and out and waking up all the Odin staff to handle their things, it was all Sybil could do to drag herself into her unfamiliar bedroom and collapse unconscious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She awoke early, the morning light streaming into her bed and hitting her like a train. It was strange and exciting after having spent so long inside the artificially lit confines of a spaceship. She reveled in it-- even though she had only slept for a few hours, there was no way she could remain unconscious, so she got out of bed and threw open her bedroom windows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their estate on Odin, though it was on the much more densely populated capital planet, was far enough from the capital city limits that all she could see out the window was a carefully tended garden that ended in thick forest not too far back. The Crawleys were a country family, through and through, even when they did come closer to the heart of civilization, and the estate here was well suited for hunting and fishing and all other good country entertainments. Sybil enjoyed a walk through the woods as much as the next person, but what she really wanted, no, needed, this moment was an excuse to get out of the house and see the rest of the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She dressed herself from the one trunk that had been hauled into the room for her the night before. She could have called for a maid to help, but she wanted a little bit of privacy to make a phone call. A new phone, one connected to the Odin planetary communications net, had been left in her room for her, and she picked it up and scrounged in her personal travel bag for the worn slip of paper on which she had written Magdalena von Westpfale’s Odin number.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was still very early, so Sybil had no idea if Maggie would answer, but she held her breath through four or five rings until the call connected and Magdalena’s sleep-thick voice said, “Who is this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie! It’s Sybil von Crawley-- you told me to call you as soon as I got to Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did?” There was a fumbling on the other end of the line, like Magdalena dropped the phone. “Right. I did. Sorry Sybil-- ah--” There was further chaos from the other side of the call.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want me to call you back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No-- I-- did you just come in?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Last night, but I fell right asleep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena laughed, sounding now more awake and like herself. “You know I don’t usually get up until nine, darling.” Sybil glanced at the clock. It was quarter to eight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry for waking you up-- I just had to call right away before my family got themselves in proper shape.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you saying that because you want to engineer an excuse to come out and see me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would love to speak with you, darling. I have a favor to ask you, in fact.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you need?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Better talk in person,” she said “Shall we meet for lunch? I know a lovely little spot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes-- I’d love to.” Sybil hesitated for a second. “I’ll have to come up with some sort of excuse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You just got to Odin. You want to go shopping. Stretch your legs. See the sights.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Without a chaperone?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sybil, if you can’t figure out how to escape your family for one afternoon, I don’t know how you could possibly be my friend.” She was teasing, and Sybil laughed. “You’re welcome to bring one of your sisters, of course. I’ve been </span>
  <em>
    <span>dying</span>
  </em>
  <span> to catch up with all three of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gods, no. I’ve just been trapped on a ship with them for weeks. I love them, but we all need some space,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> to your mother, then. She’ll understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Sybil said. “Text me the address?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will,” Maggie said. “See you then, darling.” And she hung up before Sybil had a chance to even say goodbye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slipped downstairs, finding the house eerily quiet, the unfamiliar cohort of servants staying well out of her way. She wandered through the large, empty rooms, admiring the way the golden morning light fingered the drapes on the windows and dappled the carpet in pools of warmth. She made her way to the dining room and found her father already at the table, a cup of coffee in one hand and the newspaper in the other, looking down at it and completely ignoring his breakfast. He looked up when Sybil walked in and smiled at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning, my darling,” he said. “You’re up early.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning, Papa. And it’s not really early,” Sybil said. “I’m surprised Mary and Edith aren’t down already.” She got herself some eggs and toast from the back table, then sat down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let them sleep in,” he said. “Your mother isn’t awake yet, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why are you up, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Business,” her father said. “I’d like to have a look at the estate, then I have to meet with my lawyer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you had already taken care of all of the inheritance trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought so, too, but your Granny believes that there may be other options available, and she’s going to make me go through them one by one before we give up just yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think Mary will be able to inherit Mama’s fortune?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not really ‘Mama’s fortune’ anymore, Sybil. It’s part of the estate. It hasn’t been in your mother’s name since I married her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil sighed. “Mary isn’t happy about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No one is happy, except maybe the new heir,” her father said, and shook out his newspaper. “I have to get in touch with him, as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You haven’t spoken to him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A letter back and forth after Patrick died. But I haven’t seen him in person since he was younger than you are. Now that we’re on Odin, and he’s to inherit from me, I have no excuse not to invite him around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s he like?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just told you, I don’t know him,” her father said. But even when he was grumpy, Sybil found him amusing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, alright.” She nibbled her toast. “Is Granny coming by?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For dinner tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I’m glad,” Sybil said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” her father said, though he sounded less enthusiastic by far. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t you glad to be on Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s going to be a busy season,” he said by way of an answer. “I only hope your mother will not run me too ragged with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or Granny.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Her, too,” her father agreed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Papa?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could I go out to the city today?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever for? We just got here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, exactly,” Sybil said. “I’d love to do some shopping.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do your sisters want to go with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope not,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father laughed. “I don’t much like you wandering around alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just the city,” Sybil said. “Safest place in the galaxy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you’re mother’s not here to disagree with that assessment.” He shuffled his newspaper. “If you must. Take the car and have the driver stay in eyeshot, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was a slight complication, but nothing she couldn’t work around. “Thank you, Papa.” She grinned at her father and finished her eggs.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sybil found the driver outside waiting with the car, a shiny black beast, already idling. The driver was a stocky young man, a few years older than herself she guessed, with a a gregarious smile. His hair was light brown, and swept back over his round face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Carson said you’d be wanting to go into the city, Fraulein.” He held open the back door of the car for her, and she climbed inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And did Herr Carson tell you that you would have to follow me around to make sure I didn’t wander away like a lost little duckling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That he did, Fraulein,” the driver said as he got in the front.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I likely to get terribly lost?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The capital’s a big place,” he said. “A lady like you, oh, you’d probably be fine if you knew where you were going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose that is the problem,” she said. “What’s your name, by the way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom,” he said. “Tom Branson.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice to meet you, Tom.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pleasure, I’m sure.” He had his arm hooked around the headrest of the driver’s seat, craning his neck to talk to her in the back. “Do you have a destination in mind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would love to hear it so I can take you there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you just start driving?” she asked, peering out the window back at the house. She had the sudden paranoia that one of her sisters was about to step out and stop her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, that feels to me like you’re trying to get me to kidnap you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to object to that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do have some kind of obligation to keep you safe from harm,” he said. “As long as you don’t think you’re about to walk into something dangerous, I’m happy to take you there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not dangerous,” she said. “I’m meeting someone for lunch, but it’s nowhere near lunch time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom nodded and kicked the car into gear, pulling them slowly down the gravel drive until they entered the dark, tree-lined road. Sybil slumped back against the seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I ask who you’re meeting?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not a secret boyfriend or anything like that,” she said. “I suppose you’ll have to know, but I’d prefer if you didn’t tell my parents, or anyone else, for that matter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Meeting up with a group of republican revolutionaries, then?” She could see the amused twist of his lips in the rearview mirror; their eyes met.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t know the first thing about meeting up with revolutionaries,” Sybil said. “Though it would be exciting. Don’t tell my father I said that, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your excitement’s safe with me, Fraulein.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled at him. “No, I’m meeting the Baroness Westpfale,” Sybil said. “My mother thinks she’s too wild, but I like her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Too wild?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I don’t know. I couldn’t explain it if I tried-- I don’t really understand it myself. I think she’s perfectly lovely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And so do Mary and Edith, though they wouldn’t say as much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Guess young people tend to like each other,” Tom said. “Nothing unusual about that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you’re right about that, Tom.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very happy to hear it. I do like to be right about things, on occasion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sybil had forgotten how long the trip into the city tended to take, so she didn’t spend as much time wandering around aimlessly before her meeting with Magdalena as she had been worried that she would. She asked Tom what some of the more interesting sights were in the city, and they spent a very pleasant half hour or so strolling down the streets of the capital, Sybil admiring the various shops they passed. She didn’t go in any of them, not really enthused about dragging her chauffeur dress shopping, but made mental notes of what the fashions were that were prominently displayed, and what she liked so that she could come back later. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to go back to the car to go to the restaurant?” Tom asked her, as the time to meet Magdalena inched closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a beautiful day. How far a walk is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not far,” Tom said. His look of concentration was rather endearing as he consulted his mental map of the area. “About four blocks. We’ll go through Triangle Street.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you don’t mind walking, then?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fraulein, I may be a driver, but that doesn’t mean my legs don’t work. I doubt you’re going to run me ragged.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She just laughed at him and headed further down the road. He pointed in the direction that they should go, leaving the busiest street. They didn’t make much conversation for a little while, moving faster to make good time, but as they entered one more open area, a quiet, brick plaza surrounded by tall buildings, Tom said, “Here’s Triangle Street.” His voice had a strange quality to it, and it almost echoed through the desolate square.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil glanced back at him. Tom had his hands in his pockets and was looking all around, eyes narrowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Something special about it?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whole lot of people were killed here once,” Tom said. “Republicans, some of them. Ordinary people though, mostly.” The gravitas in his voice was completely at odds with the cheerful way he had been talking to her just a little while before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” Sybil lowered her own voice, matching his tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘Course you wouldn’t have heard about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gave her a sidelong glance, trying to judge how much she really cared. Sybil leaned forward, the picture of earnesty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The last Kaiser, he wanted to make a show of executing some republicans. Decided he would have it done in public. Don’t know why it had to be a blood sport. Everything has to be a blood sport.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here?” Sybil asked, lifting her feet now as though there could be pools of blood underneath them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here,” Tom said. “But people had gotten used to this kind of thing not being a display. Things have been better since Rudolph’s time, in some ways.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The crowd didn’t like to see innocent men shot in the public square,” Tom said. “Decent folks. They tried to put a stop to it. But that couldn’t be allowed to happen.” He pointed at one of the nearby walls, and suddenly Sybil could see pockmarks in the bricks, hundreds of them, places where the heat of blaster fire had vaporized thimble sized holes in the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil looked around, face drawn. “Nothing like that ever happened at home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No?” Tom asked. “You must be very lucky then.” He didn’t sound sincere. “Or at least lucky to have never had to hear about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil didn’t know what to say to that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on,” Tom said. “You’ll be late for your lunch with the baroness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They trooped on in silence. Outside the restaurant, Tom said, “I’ll go back and fetch the car while you have lunch. I trust you won’t be kidnapped from inside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome to stay,” Sybil said. “As appreciation for giving me the grand tour.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not really my type of place,” Tom said. “And you wouldn’t want to be seen eating with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on,” Sybil encouraged. “Maggie won’t mind at all.” She wasn’t sure that was true, but she had been enjoying her conversation with Tom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll go get the car, Fraulein.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil sighed, shook her head, and went in. Tom was right that the restaurant Magdalena had chosen was quite swanky. The place was decorated with heavy marble, and bright gold accents curled across the windows of every door. A long, flat fountain decorated to look like a river ran down the center of the restaurant, its slight burble still audible over the soft music. Sybil might have felt underdressed after her morning out strolling the town, but all thoughts of that wer immediately wiped away by seeing Magdalena seated across the way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was unusually pensive looking, staring into space, with one hand dangerously tilting a tall glass of some mixed drink, the other trailing fingertips in the fountain’s rippling water. She didn’t notice Sybil come in, even when she was led to Magdalena’s table by the maitre d’. Magdalena jumped when Sybil got her attention by saying hello.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena stood up immediately, putting down her drink so that they could embrace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s so good to see you again, darling.” She kissed both Sybil’s cheeks in greeting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s good to see you, too, Maggie. How are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel like I’ve been running all over the place these past few days,” she said. “And you waking me up early--” She tried to be chastizing, but her smile was infectious instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry about that,” Sybil said. “I was just excited to talk to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And of course I’m so wonderful to talk to, I could never blame you for wanting to do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil laughed. “Thank you for taking the time to have lunch with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at all,” Magdalena said, waving her hand. “Besides, I did tell you that I was here to ask you to do me a rather large favor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, of course, whatever you need,” Sybil said with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A very good friend of mine told me recently that I shouldn’t agree to do a favor without knowing what it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you should tell me what it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s eat first. And you can tell me all about your trip here. It’s been years since I was last on a ship, you’ll have to remind me what it is like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Truly tedious,” Sybil said. But she happily described the journey anyway, and Magdalena listened with her chin resting on her dainty wrist, head tilted in a rather indulging way, a few locks of her black hair resting on her cheek. She punctuated Sybil’s stories of Edith and Mary’s squabbling with laughter, and when Sybil had truly run out of things to say, over their lunch Magdalena described all the goings on in the capital-- all the people Sybil knew who were courting each other, or feuding with each other, or planning to throw money at some ill-gotten scheme together. It all sounded deliciously exciting, and Sybil was again struck by how much she wanted to live in Magdalena’s world, a permanent resident of Odin, rather than being the outsider only there for the season.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She said as much as they ate their desert, a light-as-air cake with creme fraiche and the juiciest strawberries that she had ever tasted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if you really want to be in the thick of it,” Magdalena said. “The court is a den of serpents, in my opinion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You get along well enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena gestured with her fork. “I do well because no one can touch me. I do not have to depend on anyone but myself; I’m a baroness in my own right, I own my land and am not stupid enough to have lost all my fortune yet, and I have no meddlesome male relatives who wish to get into duels on my behalf. Even if I behave quite as badly as your mother thinks I do, the worst that people could do to me would be to stop speaking to me, and they’ll never do that.” She laughed. “I’m too entertaining to give up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could live independently,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena wagged a finger. “You’re far too innocent, my darling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena smiled. “You are, because I’m about to ask you to do something that many people who live on Odin full time would die before they agreed to, and you’re going to agree to it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Sybil asked, putting her fork down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or, not die, maybe, but they would probably be very professionally unpleasant about it, and I’m hoping that you won’t be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, don’t string me along, Maggie-- what do you need?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You remember I introduced you to Countess Grunewald, Annerose, when you were at Neue Sanssouci to be shown to the court?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, of course,” Sybil said. “I could hardly forget her.” The countess, the Kaiser’s current consort, was perhaps Edith’s age. She was a quiet woman, and she had greeted Sybil with a soft voice. Next to the dark-haired Magdalena, Countess Grunewalde had been a golden sun. She was enchantingly beautiful, and even when she returned to the old Kaiser’s side, her posture of deference making it clear she wanted to disappear into the background, Sybil couldn’t stop looking over at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She does tend to do that to people,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you bring her up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I’m trying to do her a favor that she doesn’t yet realize she needs.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil cocked her head. “What kind of favor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know of her brother?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Sybil admitted. “Who’s her brother?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Reinhard von Lohengramm,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil furrowed her brow. “But Countess Grunewald couldn’t be </span>
  <em>
    <span>married</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena rolled her eyes. “The Kaiser gave them both new names and new titles. They were born Annerose and Reinhard von Musel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Sybil said. She hadn’t ever heard of something like that happening before, but, then again, Maggie was right that out in the country, she had been isolated from the minute details of court life. Even if she had heard about such a thing, it probably would have slipped directly out of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was probably partially to be generous, and partially to put some distance between the two of them,” Magdalena said. “Reinhard is quite, shall we say, attached, to his sister.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m quite attached to my sisters,” Sybil said in this stranger’s defense. “That’s hardly a crime.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is when your sister is His Majesty’s chosen,” Magdalena said. “Anyway, that’s all beside the point. The thing is, both of the are, shall we say, unpopular at court.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because Annerose displaced the Kaiser’s previous favorite, Marquise Benemunde, who was viewed rather favorably. And both of them came from nothing, in terms of what the court considers an acceptable background, and they’ve both made nuisances of themselves by seeming above the rest of things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was recently reminded that the Kaiser is quite old, and this means that someday in the near future, Annerose, who is my bosom friend, will lack his protection.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’ll only have her brother to rely on. And myself, of course. So, what I am attempting to do is get Reinhard to play nice with the rest of the court. When the day comes for them both to stand on their own, I don’t want them to be immediately eaten alive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That seems reasonable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would think so, wouldn’t you? The problem is that he detests them all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It seems like half the members of the court hate each other, for one reason or another, to hear you say it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course they do. But they know how to pretend to be civilized. Count Lohengramm does not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure what you’re getting at. What do you need me to do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena steepled her fingers and looked across the table at Sybil. “Darling, Count Lohengramm is beautiful, rich, intelligent, and, most importantly, single. He’s not going to want to marry either you or your sisters, but I would like for you to convince your father to invite him to your house so that your sisters can at least make a show of flirting with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quite simply, he needs to be trained to put up with it. And the rest of society needs to see that he can go to a party without standing in the corner and scowling, looking like he’s figuring out the fastest way he could murder any given guest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he really that terrible?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Magdalena said with a laugh. “But almost.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you like him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I love him. Though I love his sister more.” She smiled. “He’s perfectly pleasant in any other circumstance than a party. You’d like him, too, I imagine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Sybil said. “How am I supposed to convince my parents to let him come?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your parents are just as far out of the loop as you are, so at least they shouldn’t already hate him.” Magdalena tapped her chin in thought. “Your father was in the fleet, correct?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, for a long time,” Sybil said. “I think he regrets retiring.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perfect. Reinhard is His Majesty’s most talented admiral. I’m sure your father would be thrilled to meet him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see what I can do. Mary has convinced my parents to hold some kind of party-- I’ll make sure he’s on the invitation list.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Surprisingly earnest, Magdalena leaned forward and took Sybil’s hand across the table. “Thank you, darling. I appreciate it more than you know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sybil had hoped to get back home and get ready for dinner without any fanfare (or her sisters asking where she had been), but when Tom drove her up to the front of the house, she saw another car already in the driveway, and her grandmother getting out of it. This was not exactly a surprise, but it was exiting. Sybil hopped out of the car before Tom could even turn off the engine, and she ran up to her grandmother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Granny! I thought you weren’t going to be here until dinner time.” Her grandmother looked about the same as Sybil remembered: the same short and spindly frame, the same austere lined face. She clutched the head of her cane, but still seemed sprightly as she greeted Sybil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My dear, I’m always exactly on time. I didn’t want to wait to see you all, after you’ve left me alone here for so long.” She looked Sybil over, head to toe. “Where did you just come from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been out in the city,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“By yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Papa had Tom keep an eye on me.” She pointed out Tom, who heard his name and tipped his hat politely to the dowager.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what were you doing in the city with Tom’s watchful eye upon you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shopping,” she lied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her grandmother peered around her and took a look at the car, from which nothing was being unloaded. “Is that so? What did you buy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hasty to change the subject, Sybil said, “We should go inside. Everyone will be so happy to see you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping to have a nice long talk with your father before dinner,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their arrival had now been noticed by the servants, so Carson was at the door to let them in. They stepped inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did you want to talk to him about?” Sybil asked, though she knew the answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The future of you and your sisters,” her grandmother said. “Where is your father?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In the library, m’lady,” Carson said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her grandmother nodded and set off down the hall, Sybil following at her heels. Just as Carson was about to open the library door and announce them, the dowager said, “You ought to get changed for dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her grandmother was not going to brook any disagreement, and gave Sybil a severe look. “It will be more pleasant for us all to speak again at dinner time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Granny,” Sybil said, though she was frowning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson opened the library door and stepped inside. “The Dowager Countess, milord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama,” Sybil could hear her father say. “I wasn’t expecting you until dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?” her grandmother could be heard to ask as Carson shut the door behind them both, leaving himself and Sybil in the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish I could hear what she’s going to say to Papa,” Sybil said to Carson.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let us hope that she says something in Lady Mary’s favor, m’lady,” Carson replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She will. But Mary will be alright even if she doesn’t, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure, m’lady.” But with Carson’s dour voice, Sybil couldn’t really tell if he believed it or not.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>As expected, dinner that night was a somewhat fraught affair. Aside from the dowager, there weren’t any guests, but that only meant that Mary and Edith had more free rein to snip at each other. They apparently hadn’t taken the chance, as Sybil had, to spend the day as far apart from each other as possible, or, if they had, it hadn’t done anything to improve their spirits. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How was your talk with the lawyer today, Robert?” Sybil’s mother, Cora, asked as they began eating. She was trying to smile nicely, but it was a pointed question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Informative,” her father said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure,” the dowager cut in. “But he was informing you of things that you already knew. I hope you will take my concerns into consideration.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you speaking to Papa about this afternoon?” Mary asked, lifting her wine glass and looking astutely between her grandmother and father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like your father to enlist the services of a Phezzani property lawyer,” the dowager said. “Your mother’s fortune was Phezzani to begin with; I see no reason why it shouldn’t become Phezzani again, so that you could inherit it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gods,” Mary said. “Are you trying to make me an expatriate?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your mother is one,” the dowager said. “But just because money is on Phezzan, there’s no reason you would have to live there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought that there were laws against moving money to Phezzan to avoid the estate tax?” Edith said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is why Robert should contact a </span>
  <em>
    <span>reputable </span>
  </em>
  <span>Phezzani lawyer,” the dowager said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama, can we discuss this later?” Robert asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t see why we shouldn’t discuss this now,” Mary said. “After all, it’s going to determine how exactly I spend my time this season, and you weren’t willing to discuss it on the ship here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mary,” her mother said. “Please moderate your tone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So I shall not even have a token say in how my future will be decided?” Mary asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robert put down his fork. “Mary-- this isn’t about trying to deprive you of your inheritance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It certainly feels like it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If we do as your Granny suggests, and we move a vast sum of money to Phezzan, the Grantham estate will no longer be able to function,” Robert said, his voice hard. He looked directly at Cora as he said this. “I have a responsibility, not just to Mary, but to every employee of this house, every tenant on our land, all the previous members of this family who have safely shepherded the estate through in one piece, and the crown. I cannot abandon those responsibilities. Splitting Cora’s fortune and sending it to Phezzan would be cutting off the estate’s legs, and I cannot do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a deathly silence for a second, then Mary said, “But you’d abandon my future.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am not </span>
  <em>
    <span>abandoning</span>
  </em>
  <span> anything!” Robert raised his voice. “Least of all my daughter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary, though clearly not cowed, dropped the subject, raising her wine glass to her lips so that she wouldn’t say anything more. In the awkward silence that followed, Cora said, “How was your trip into the city, Sybil?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, it was lovely,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did you do there?” Edith asked. “You could have taken me along.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would have been bored,” Sybil said. “I mostly walked around to see what the fashions are this season. Tom made sure I didn’t get too lost.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom?” Mary asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Our new driver,” Cora supplied. “I’m glad you had a good time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil spotted an opportunity to get her family to agree to the favor Magdalena wanted. “I’ve definitely made some notes about the kind of outfit I’d like to wear to the party that we’ll be hosting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Party?” the dowager asked. “What kind of party?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a dinner, maybe some dancing. It’s to gather all of Mary’s potential suitors in one place, so they squabble over each other and kill each other off,” Edith said. “We discussed it on the trip.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have any potential suitors yet,” Mary said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Every single man of the right age and stature is a potential suitor, my dear,” the dowager said. “And we certainly are not in short supply of those. But what about the new heir? Have you given up on him so soon? He might be as suitable of a match as Patrick was, and that would save your father from having to choose between his real child, and the estate that he feels is his child.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t properly met the man,” Mary said haughtily. “And I don’t know why you believe that he would have any desire to mary me out of pity for my lack of prospects.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There will be plenty of people we can have come,” Sybil said, trying to diffuse the situation and get a word in edgewise. “I’ve been thinking that there are some people I’d like to invite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who do you have in mind?” Cora asked, happy to play into continuing to change the topic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was thinking-- when I came out I met Countess Grunewald-- I’d like to meet her brother, Admiral Lohengramm; she spoke so well about him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her grandmother gave Sybil a look. “My dear, there are more suitable matches for you than he.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Sybil asked. “What’s wrong with him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing’s wrong with him,” the dowager said, looking like she was licking a slice of lemon. “But all he is is a pretty face, much like his sister.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought he was quite successful in the fleet,” Sybil protested. “Papa, wouldn’t you like to meet His Majesty’s most talented young admiral?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re so desperate to invite this man you’ve never met,” Mary said. “I can’t imagine why.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m rather curious about him myself,” Edith said. “I’ve seen his picture in the news. He does stir the imagination.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And wouldn’t he look quite foolish, standing next to someone like you at a party?” Mary asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mary, that’s quite enough,” Cora said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have nothing against inviting Admiral Lohengramm,” Robert said. “We’ll have to put together a full list. Do you have any other suggestions, Mama?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heavens, you suddenly care about my opinion of the court.” The dowager looked at her granddaughters consideringly. “You liked the Duke of Crowsburg when you met him last season, did you not, Mary? He should be on the list.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did rather like him,” Cora said. “He made a charming impression.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Mary said. “Invite whomever you like.” She folded her napkin and placed it next to her plate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Edith? What about you?” her mother asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We will invite the new heir, won’t we?” Edith asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary laughed. “You’ll try your hand at him, will you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since you seem intent on making life difficult for yourself, yes, I will,” Edith said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course we’ll invite Cousin Matthew,” Cora said. “Though we should meet him before hand, if he’s not too busy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Too busy?” the dowager asked. “Why would he be too busy to come meet the family he is going to inherit from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s a lawyer, Mama,” Cora said. “I expect he has obligations.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A lawyer? What would he be that for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robert looked exhausted. “He had no intention of inheriting anything before Patrick died,” he said. “His father was a doctor. I believe they’re middle class, of some fashion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How dreadful,” the dowager said. “Yes, you must invite him here before you bring him to any kind of party. Make sure he knows how to behave himself, so that he doesn’t embarrass the family in front of whatever esteemed guests you choose to invite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure he wouldn’t, Granny,” Sybil said. “I look forward to meeting him, really.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sybil found Mary as she was getting ready for bed that night, having Anna take down her hair and brush it out so that it fell in long, dark waves down her back. Sybil sat on the edge of her bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you really determined to make this whole thing difficult for Papa?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He seems determined to make it difficult for me,” Mary said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t mean to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t matter what he means to do.” She put her hands down flat on her dressing table and turned to Sybil. “I don’t think you understand, really. I have to lose the home I grew up in, everything I’ve ever thought was mine, to give it to some middle class lawyer I’ve never met, for no reason other than that Papa refuses to fight for me.” She scowled. “If he was determined, he would find some way to make this Cousin Matthew a landless peer, detach the title from the estate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil was silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Mary asked. “Don’t look at me like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, Mary,” Sybil said, “Edith has had quite the opportunity to gloat at you, and she hasn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why should I care what Edith says?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your prospects have changed, but hers and mine haven’t. We two were never going to inherit anything, and would have always had to leave the estate someday,” Sybil pointed out. “You could accept it with a little bit more grace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t try to be the better person about this. I won’t be able to bear it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not trying to be,” Sybil said. “I just think that you would be happier if--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The last thing anybody seems to care about is my happiness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not true. I care.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary’s mouth pressed into a thin line. “Goodnight, Sybil.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil stood. “Goodnight.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>When a man left the fleet, along with his last paycheck, he was given one thing for free: passage to any planet within the Empire. When he filled out his paperwork before his discharge from the military hospital, Thomas’s hand had hovered over the choices. He could go back home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he wasn’t going to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was absolutely nothing waiting for him on the planet he had originally embarked from, and this was the next logical step, after the fleet, to changing his life. He had an honorable discharge (medical, wounded in service) so he wouldn’t be barred from employment like people who were sent out of the fleet for various infractions-- drug use and the like-- and he had survived. That was more than a lot of people could say, so Thomas would take it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had originally gone into the fleet to escape his backwater home planet. With no further hesitation, he entered Odin into the form, then sat back, satisfied, at the desk in his small hospital room. He had said he would get to Odin, after all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, when they discharged him from the military hospital, he was packed on a a military transport, and then dumped unceremoniously onto the capital’s streets, with truly nothing other than his small bag of possessions containing little more than the few non-uniform outfits he owned and had been carrying with him for the duration of his service. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Thomas stepped out of the spaceport on Odin, he was briefly overwhelmed. He hadn’t been on a planet in nearly two years, so the bright sunlight moderated by the atmosphere and the early fall breeze stopped him hin his tracks. He hadn’t felt wind, real wind-- not too-strong ventilation, not the sucking of a vacuum pulling air through a ship, not the chimney effect of a confined space fire-- in so long that he had almost forgotten how to breathe it in. When the air buffeted his face, it shocked him and he struggled to take a breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He squinted in the morning light, then wandered over to stand beneath a tree and took out his cigarettes, the ones he had bought in the spaceport as soon as he had gotten off the ship. Even the fleet hadn’t managed to cure him of the habit, though it had certainly tried. He couldn’t buy cigarettes at the commissary, of course, and any found in his belongings (or worse, in his hands) would have been taken as contraband and punished accordingly, but there was always someone who managed to sneak them on board a ship, and Thomas paid the price he had to. And someone always knew spots on the ship where the air filtration would suck the smoke away before it could be picked up by the detectors, or where the smoke detectors had been rendered useless. They had nicotine gum and ten different kinds of other mild stimulants available, either in the rations or at the commissary, but that wasn’t the same. There was a ritual to finding the lighter and cigarette, to steadying the shake in his hands enough that he could light it, to taking the first drag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His left hand was stiff, covered by a leather glove, but that didn’t stop it from trembling. He hated the way the grafted skin was too tight, and the way that every sensation felt muted, and the new clumsiness in the limb. He tried not to think about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas watched people pass by: families greeted their returning sons, or cried after their departing ones. There was no one to greet Thomas, just like there hadn’t been anyone to see him sent off in the first place. He didn’t mind that so much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas had never been to any kind of major city before, aside from his time in Iserlohn Fortress, so the variety and number of people going by was unfamiliar to him. And Iserlohn hardly counted as a city, since it was purely military in function, and the civilians who lived there were all working in service of the fleet. Its few streets still had the unmistakable sensation of being in an enclosed space, and it only took walking a little way away from that main concourse to find oneself back in narrow hallways, brushing past streams of soldiers hurrying this way and that, each with some urgent task to fulfil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With his right hand, he fingered the bills in his pocket, the cash he had taken his last pay in. There wasn’t much of it. Strange how, even when on a ship, with nowhere to go and nothing much to spend money on, Thomas had managed to earn very little. His reserves would last him a couple weeks in a hotel, at most, and he would have to find a job before he could put his name on a lease. He supposed this was why most people went back home after their service, instead of trying their luck in the capital. If a man didn’t get lucky, he would end up worse off than when he started.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t know his way around, so after his cigarette burned down to a stub that he crushed under his heel, he picked a direction and started walking towards the city. No one paid him ay mind whatsoever. He would find what he needed to find, he was sure of it. There had to be something on this planet for a man who was willing to go and get it.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Two and a half weeks later, in a motel room with walls so thin he could hear every word of his neighbor’s conversations, Thomas admitted to himself that he was going to have to try a different tack. That didn’t mean he was giving up on a new life on Odin, but he was going to need to alter his expectations. Though he had assumed that his discharge from the fleet would have been enough to assure employers that he was a reasonably upright man, it was turning out to be less the case than Thomas had hoped. After all, every able man in the Empire served in the fleet, and the people he had spoken with tended to take one look at his gloved hand, and smile in the polite way that didn’t reach their eyes. He had to wonder, if it had been his right hand that had been wounded, would they have refused to shake it?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In any event, Thomas had reached the tail end of his cash reserves, and he needed a job that would give him a cash advance, or a place to stay. There was only one of those that he was relatively sure existed, and which would hire him, though it grated to ask. It was, at least, approaching the time when the Crawley family would be on Odin for the season, so he was sure that the Odin house staff would be looking for temporary, seasonal hires. It was unclear in his mind if it was preferable to be a seasonal hire and leave at the end of the few months with a reference in hand, or if he would try to leverage his employment to a permanent, travelling role. That would entail going back home, and would be a step in the wrong direction, but--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was getting ahead of himself. He would figure that out when he saw the conditions on the ground, what the house was like, what the season itself was like. He still had choices; he wasn’t going to get fooled into thinking he didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Crawley house on Odin was a far bit away from the capital city, out in the woods, and the cost of the ticket on the train to the nearest village was enough that Thomas decided to walk from the station to the house, rather than trying to call and pay for a cab. It was a several mile walk, along thin, winding roads. But at least the day was neither cold nor unseasonably warm, and he didn’t mind the walk. He had not called ahead; he thought it might be better to make a plea in person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Surprisingly, when he turned down the drive that went to the Crawley house, further back in the woods, several cars whizzed past him. Was the house occupied already? Perhaps the family had come early. Well, all the better. They were sure to need more hands urgently, then.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Indeed, as he approached the great house, standing out in heavy grey stone against the surrounding greenery, there were all manner of gardeners and staff walking about, tending the lawns or moving between the outbuildings and the main house. Thomas was ignored completely as he walked around the back, looking for the servants’ entrance. If all of the staff were here, his best chance was to find Mr. Carson, the butler, who was responsible for hiring of the male staff.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door at the rear of the house was propped open, and so Thomas slipped inside, finding himself in the cool, dark half-basement level that was the servants’ domain in every like house. It was hardly any different from the Grantham country estate, except Thomas had no idea where all the hallways led. He was sure he would figure it out soon enough; the house couldn’t be as labyrinthine as all that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Voices echoed softly down the halls, and Thomas stuck his hands in his pockets and walked towards them, projecting an air of confidence and belonging.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he reached the gathered group of people, a door creaked open into the hallway, and a broad shouldered man with an unpleasant face stepped out. He had a cane in one hand, and was carrying a pair of riding boots in his other. He came up short when he saw Thomas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you?” he asked, voice harsh and suspicious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas Barrow,” Thomas replied. “I’m here to see Mr. Carson.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who let you in?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The door was open.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you just walked through?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m looking for Mr. Carson. Figured he’d likely be down here, or somebody’d be down here who could let him know I’m looking for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What business do you have with him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“None of yours,” Thomas said. “He’s still the butler of this house, isn’t he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Carson may be the butler of this estate, but the estate belongs to the Lord Grantham, and you, a stranger, have entered it without any invitation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a stranger. Mr. Carson knows me.” He might have been better off being obsequious to this man, but there was something about his bearing, the way his knuckles were white on his cane, the way his voice was so angry already when Thomas had done nothing wrong, that made him quirk his lips in a half smile, unintimidated, his own voice fresh and calm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suggest that you leave,” the man said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if my business is so urgent that Mr. Carson would be unhappy you turned me away without letting him hear what it was?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You haven’t stated your business.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nor you, yours,” Thomas said. “I know who I need to speak to, and you haven’t given me a reason why it should be you, instead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suggest you leave. Now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suggest you get Mr. Carson.” Thomas kept his smile on his face. “I don’t know who you are, but I know you’re not the butler.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another door opened down the hall, making the muffled sounds of conversation suddenly clear, and causing both the man and Thomas to glance down the hallway. Mrs. Hughes, the housekeeper, was coming out of the kitchen, accompanied by Lady Mary. They looked down the hall and saw Thomas and the man standing there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas Barrow?” Lady Mary asked. “Is that you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, m’lady,” Thomas said, smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mrs. Hughes and Lady Mary both came towards them, though Mrs. Hughes seemed somewhat alarmed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you were in the fleet for another year, at least,” Lady Mary said. “What in Odin’s name are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man next to Thomas was growing more frustrated with every word that Lady Mary spoke, but only Thomas seemed to be aware of the tension in his posture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was discharged, m’lady,” Thomas said. “Wounded.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Mrs. Hughes said. “But, may I ask, what </span>
  <em>
    <span>are </span>
  </em>
  <span>you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I found myself on Odin, and I had to wonder if you were looking for extra hands, for the season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll have to speak with Mr. Carson about that,” Mrs. Hughes said. “I don’t know if he’s of a mind to hire more footmen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Thomas said. “I was just looking for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel like he must be,” Lady Mary said. “Since we’re going to be doing so much entertaining this season.” There was some odd tone in her voice, one that Thomas was extremely curious about. To Thomas, she said, “I was just speaking to Mrs. Patmore about the menu for the first party that we’ll be having.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas nodded and smiled. “I hope Mr. Carson agrees with you, m’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were now other people leaving the kitchen, including a short young woman who glanced at the group standing in the hallway and began to hurry away nervously. Mrs. Hughes stopped her. “Daisy, would you fetch Mr. Carson? He’s in the wine cellar.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Mrs. Hughes,” Daisy squeaked, and hurried off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s no need for you to be held up, m’lady,” Mrs. Hughes said. “We’ll have this settled, and the menu.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m in no hurry,” Mary said. “Thomas-- if it’s not impolite-- what kind of injury got you discharged?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A burn, m’lady,” Thomas said. He pulled his hand out of his pocket and held it up, though it was still gloved, not revealing the ugly scar tissue. “All up my arm. I was trying to pull a captain out from where he had been trapped, and my suit arm melted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t sure if it was to Mary’s credit that she paled slightly, or to Mrs. Hughes that she showed little reaction. “And you’re looking to be a footman?” Mrs. Hughes asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or something of the like,” Thomas said. “I won’t be ugly waiting table, anyway, since footmen wear gloves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you believe you’d be able to perform the tasks of a footman?” Mrs. Hughes asked. “A medical discharge from the fleet as being unfit for service--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gods,” Lady Mary said. “We kept Bates, didn’t we?” and she nodded at the man. “If anything, it’ll be nice for him to have some company, with his war wound and all.” Bates-- this was Lord Grantham’s valet, then, the one who had replaced Thomas-- tried and failed to not look even more angry at Thomas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quite right, m’lady,” Mrs. Hughes said. “Though Mr. Carson would like his say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I most certainly would,” Mr. Carson said, appearing down the hallway with the nervous looking Daisy in tow. Daisy scooted back into the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Carson,” Lady Mary said. “Surely you remember Thomas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, though as I recall, he worked in the country estate, and not here.” Carson’s voice was brutally dry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m on Odin now, Mr. Carson.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see that. And what, exactly, are you doing on Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was wondering if you needed some extra hands for the season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure Lady Mary doesn’t need us to relitigate this in the hallway, and you have things to do, Mr. Bates,” Mrs. Hughes said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Carson said. “Quite right.” He gestured for Thomas to follow him, and gave a nod to Lady Mary. “M’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is good to see you again, Thomas,” Mary said with a smile, catching Carson’s eye as she did. “I’m glad you made it out of the fleet in one piece.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Thomas said. “And mostly, m’lady.” He followed Carson off down the hallway.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>It had been the brusque and coincidental intervention of Lady Mary that had secured Thomas the job, he was sure, though he didn’t feel like he owed her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas ran into O’brien as he was going to look for a fitting set of livery down in the wardrobe where all those things were kept in the servants’ hall. O’brien was walking down the hallway, then stopped in her tracks when she saw him, her face blanching.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is,” he said, turning towards her. “I made it to Odin after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hastily, she stepped inside the room with all the liveries and shut the door behind herself. “You didn’t tell me you were coming back here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why should I have?” he asked. “I didn’t expect to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I ran out of money.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She made a derisive noise. “Of course. But you’re working here, now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Carson’s taken me on as a footman, at least for the season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“First?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He didn’t say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>O’brien frowned. “William won’t like that. He’s first.” Thomas had no idea who William was, but he didn’t think it mattered. It didn’t surprise him that whoever had taken his place would be unhappy at his return.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence as they looked each other over. O’brien didn’t look that much different. She had the same permanent scowl lines around her mouth, and she wasn’t even doing her tightly brushed hair in a different way. “What’ve things been like since I’ve been gone?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Same as usual. Lady Mary’s gotten left out in the cold, so all the girls are scrambling to find husbands this season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Thomas flicked some lint off the shoulder of one of the liveries.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Patrick died. The new heir’s some stranger, and Lady Mary has no interest in him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how have you been? I was beginning to think you had died, since you stopped writing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas silently held up his gloved hand. “Medical discharge. I was in the burn unit for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Couldn’t have written then, could you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And said what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head silently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see you didn’t actually get rid of His Lordship’s new valet,” Thomas pointed out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s not so new, now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t seem like he’s the type you could stand to have around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There was no point in sticking my neck out to get rid of him, since you had run off for your own stupid reasons,” she said. “If you ignore him, he leaves you alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He stopped me in the hallway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t make trouble, Thomas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want his job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked at him. “You’re the new one, now,” she said. “Especially around here. You’d better be careful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You trying to warn me of something?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m trying to tell you that if you want something, you might want to be smart about how you go around trying to get it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not going to help me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Give me a reason why I should.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, since you think I’m a stranger, you won’t think I have anything worth offering you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, then,” she said. “Suit yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did what you said,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I told you to go join the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You told me not to die,” he said. “I didn’t do that, at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fat lot of good it’s done you.” Her acerbic voice was only to hide whatever true thing she felt towards Thomas. She had looked like she had seen a ghost when she caught sight of him. “How bad is the wound that got you out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not something that ladies like to see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She snorted. “And you think I’m a lady? I’m trying to figure out if the first time someone hands you a plate you’ll drop it on the ground.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas obliged, rolling up his shirtsleeve and pulling off his glove, revealing pitted and warped red flesh from fingertip to elbow. Compared to the rest of his body, feeling the damp chill of the servants’ hall basement, his left arm was a senseless lump, barely part of his body at all. But he curled and uncurled his fingers, demonstrating to O’brien that he could, if barely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried not to look disgusted with it, but she didn’t really succeed. Thomas had to wonder: if the arm was not attached to him, if this was someone else’s barely healed wound, would he be able to hide his reaction to it? He had seen a lot of wounds when pulling people out of destroyed ships-- that was the duty of the medical corps-- but those were visceral and fresh and somehow of their element. Everyone in the medical corps expected to see a skull with the brains coming out, or to walk down the hallway and slip on somebody’s guts that had spilled onto the floor. But nobody in this house, this pristine place, expected to see Thomas’s ruined flesh. It was unnatural, and disturbing. The nobles never wanted to see the reality of the fleet they funded and used to wage war; their servants were shielded from it too, especially the women.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Mr. Carson’s going to let you wait at table with that?” O’brien finally said, the dryness of her mouth clear and present in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas touched the livery hanging in the wardrobe. “Sleeves cover to the elbow, and footmen wear gloves. Nobody even has to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” she said. “Nobody upstairs’ll have to think about it at all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thomas settled back in to the Grantham estate quickly over the next few days. Aside from the fact that he was on Odin, there was very little different about life working as a servant. Every day had the same routine, and after a few initial glances of surprise from the family upstairs, no one seemed to care that Thomas served their dinner. It wouldn’t have mattered who was doing the task, so long as the task got done. All the servants were interchangeable, in that way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Downstairs was a slightly different story. As O’brien had warned, Thomas had disrupted whatever natural order there was to things. William, the gangly young footman who Thomas had displaced as first, took an instant disliking to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the servants’ dinner one night, when a few people were sitting around the table, reading the day’s papers or doing small mending tasks, Thomas was drinking a coffee and flipping through a magazine, contemplating the clothing advertisements. Since he had been wearing nothing but uniforms for a long time, he figured that now he was on Odin and earning a steady paycheck, he might like to have something nice to wear when he went into the city. Not that he had much occasion to go into the city, but he figured he would get the chance to, someday.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Daisy, who worked in the kitchen, leaned on her elbows on the table in front of him, looking at him up from her own book. “You’ve been to Iserlohn Fortress, haven’t you?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure,” Thomas said. William, down at the end of the table, was shooting a nasty look at him, though since all Thomas had done was be an object of Daisy’s attention for a moment, he couldn’t have said why he deserved that, at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s it like?” Daisy asked. “I’ve heard it’s huge.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t think it’s really some place you’d like to go,” William said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?” Daisy asked. “There’s regular people who live on it, isn’t there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are,” Thomas said, flipping to the next page in his magazine. “Plenty. It’s a nice place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“See, I could live there,” Daisy said. “Did you like it there?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I liked it alright,” Thomas said. “Didn’t get to spend too much time walking around, but I did see the gardens. They keep it so it’s spring all the time there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gods,” Daisy said. “Think of that! It never snows?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a space station, of course it doesn’t snow,” William said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It rains,” Thomas said. “But there wouldn’t be any point to making it snow, would there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve seen a lot of the galaxy, haven’t you?” Daisy was fairly enraptured, though Thomas’s anodyne answers truly didn’t deserve that level of attention. Still, the fact that it was making William seethe was fairly funny. Thomas didn’t mind egging him on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve seen enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never been off Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m happy to have gotten here,” Thomas said, “so maybe count yourself lucky on that count.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I know I should,” Daisy said. “But I do have to wonder, well, there’s so many interesting places everywhere. I’d love to travel someday, maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You going back with the family at the end of the season?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Mrs. Patmore is satisfied with me,” Daisy said. “I might. That was what she said when they took me on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas nodded. “There’s worse ways to see the galaxy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you ever been to Phezzan?” Daisy asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, never.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d love to see there.” The dreamy tone in her voice was endearing, in its way, but childish, mostly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My mother says we should all be grateful to be in the places we are,” William said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, can it, William,” Daisy said. “It doesn’t hurt to think about what it’s like, out there in the rest of the galaxy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You ever travelled, William?” Thomas asked, taking a sip of his coffee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” William huffed. “And I don’t have much of a mind to, neither.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not,” Thomas said. “Otherwise, you’d be in the fleet.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Daisy said. “Why aren’t you, William? You’re not too old.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you got Lord Grantham to sign the paper that says you’re vital to the functioning of the estate, so you wouldn’t have to. Condition of your employment here, and all,” Thomas said. “I know how it goes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you really do that?” Daisy asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My mother wouldn’t want me to--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure, everybody’s mother wouldn’t want them to go join the fleet,” Thomas said. “It’s the lucky few who are able to sneak out of it because they just don’t want to go. It takes a certain amount of bravery.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you have to be very brave?” Daisy asked Thomas, leaning further forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, very,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did you do in the fleet?” Daisy asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was at this point that Bates walked in, taking in the scene of Daisy on her elbows listening to Thomas, and William seething at the end of the table. He frowned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bates was in the fleet too, weren’t you?” William asked. “Why don’t you ever ask him about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bates seemed unenthused about being drawn into this. “Because I am too old to be flirted with by someone Daisy’s age,” he said. “And you should stop before Mrs. Patmore has something to say about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not illegal for us to talk, Mr. Bates,” Thomas said. “Is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s not,” Daisy agreed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But since you’re asking, I served out my tour of duty,” Bates said. “I did not leave early.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Thomas asked, setting down his coffee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s plenty of men with injuries just like yours, isn’t there?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>William wasn’t stupid enough to not be able to piece together what Bates had implied, but Daisy hadn’t figured it out. “How did you get hurt then, Thomas?” William asked. “Enough that you’d be able to hold a plate but not a gun?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas put a thin smile on his face. “If you’re so eager to find out the details, I suggest you leave service and enlist. His Majesty’s fleet would be more than happy to take an able young man like you.” And he shuffled his magazines. “And at least I can hold a plate, and carry suitcases, and do all the tasks I’ve been hired here to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s right,” Daisy said. “That’s why Mr. Carson made you first footman.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>William scowled.</span>

  <p>
  <span>Reinhard and Kircheis were in their flat at Linbergstrasse, and Reinhard was fussing with his outfit. Magdalena had told him, on no uncertain terms, that he was not allowed to wear his dress uniform to a purely social party, one filled with people who were interested in speaking to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Count</span>
  </em>
  <span> Lohengramm, so he had needed to find something formal but nice to wear. The red jacket suited him, maybe, but he still resented it for the imposition that it represented.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look good, Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said, stepping up behind him in the bedroom and looking at Reinhard’s reflection in the full length dressing mirror. Kircheis was dressed in civilian clothes as well, but nothing fancy; he hadn’t been invited to the party. That was another thing that Reinhard resented.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” Reinhard muttered, fiddling with his cravat some more. Kircheis put his hands on Reinhard’s shoulders and turned him, so that they were facing each other and he could do the tie for him. “What would happen if I didn’t go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Annerose would be disappointed in you,” Kircheis pointed out. “It’s a few hours of your time, and the food will be good. It can’t be as bad as that fleet party you went to at--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That was different,” Reinhard said. “And you weren’t there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I had been, I would have advised you didn’t try to duel Luneburg,” Kircheis said. “And I suppose I should advise you not to duel anyone at this party, either, just in case.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know who else is coming.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness Westpfale said you were likely to get along just fine with all of the guests.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t trust her opinion on that,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do,” Kircheis said. “It will be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just tedious, and a waste of time. I have better things I could be doing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you?” Kircheis asked, smiling. “You have no standing orders from the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard just scowled. “You know what I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll still be here when you get back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard reached up and tugged a curl of Kircheis’s red hair. “Come with me?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not invited.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just for company in the car?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis pretended to look annoyed, but he didn’t really succeed. “Only if you stop complaining about what a horrible imposition it is to go to a friendly social event.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is an imposition,” Reinhard said. “It’s quite beneath my dignity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis laughed. “I’ll come. But don’t take that as an excuse to sneak out and leave early. This is for Lady Annerose’s sake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The car ride was pleasant, if long. Reinhard, who still had not gotten around to buying a car of his own, borrowed a fleet vehicle, though not a driver. Kircheis drove, keeping the auto steering engaged for most of the way, unfamiliar with the route. Privacy in the car allowed them to talk about whatever they liked, but Kircheis stopped short of allowing Reinhard to mess up his outfit by removing any of it, which only annoyed Reinhard a little. His mood was much improved by the time they arrived, heading down the long, unmarked road that led to the Grantham estate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sun was setting as Kircheis pulled them into the driveway, casting the huge stone house’s roof in molten red, while the rest was in shadow, except for the lit windows like watchful, yellow eyes. There were plenty of other cars parked to the side of the house, but it wasn’t nearly as crowded as some of the other gatherings Reinhard had been forced to attend, at Neue Sanssouci or for the fleet. Magdalena, in her way, had been kind to choose a small party to force Reinhard into. Aside from the effort to rescue Reinhard’s social reputation, there likely wouldn’t be any major political dealings here, not with this relatively obscure family and their guests.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll be fine out here?” Reinhard asked as Kircheis stopped the car so that he could get out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Kircheis said. There was an unspoken ‘Perhaps I should be more worried about you’ in the way his mouth twisted up in a slight smile, his eyes crinkling, but Reinhard appreciated that he didn’t mention it aloud. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of the footmen from the great house, a gangly young man, came over as soon as he noticed Reinhard getting out of the car. Reinhard decided it would be easiest to simply allow himself to be shuffled along between the various formalities it would take to get him into the house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Outside, it was a chill early autumn evening, but inside the house was bright and perhaps overly warm. The butler introduced Reinhard at the door of the library where the whole gathering was beginning, people standing or sitting and talking in small groups. They looked up when the butler’s sonorous voice announced, “The Count Reinhard von Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard had been invited to this party, but looking around the room, he realized that he knew nearly no one, except-- yes, there, coming over and bringing the hostess with him, smiling, the stiffly dressed Matthew von Crawley, erstwhile heir to this estate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Coun Lohengramm, I’m so glad you could come,” the hostess, a middle aged and pleasant looking woman, said. “It’s a pleasure to meet you at last. Matthew has spoken quite highly of you.” Although her tone and expression were both gracious, she was sizing Reinhard up, looking every aspect of him over, and he wondered if she found him wanting. It wouldn’t matter if she did, but he wondered nonetheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m grateful for the invitation, Lady Grantham,” Reinhard said. “I’m afraid that I’ve been so busy with the fleet that I’ve been neglecting most of my social responsibilities.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A man such as yourself neglecting society?” Lady Grantham asked. “It’s the rest of society that has been missing out on you, I’m sure.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard smiled thinly at the compliment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A pleasure to see you again, Admiral,” Matthew said. He offered his hand to shake, an they did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you been settling in here well?” Reinhard asked. He had taken a liking to the man. Matthew was firm and capable and wholly unpretentious, qualities that Reinhard liked in other people. He would have gotten on well with Kircheis, so it was a shame for multiple reasons that Kircheis was sitting out in the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, I have,” Matthew said. “If you’ll let me make the introductions, Cousin Cora?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“By all means!” Lady Grantham said. “You’ll be charmed to meet my daughters, I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard smiled and nodded, and Matthew led Reinhard further into the room. “Baroness Westpfale will be pleased you were able to make it,” Matthew said as they walked towards Count Grantham and his daughters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I half hoped that she would be here.” It wasn’t entirely surprising that Magdalena wasn’t here. He had been warned that this dinner was for the three Crawley daughters to scope out various eligible men, and it wouldn’t have been wise to invite competition.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew laughed. “I understand she’s considered a little bit of a bad influence on young women.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard frowned, thinking that this was probably due to her associations with his sister. “And yet she thinks she can be a good influence on me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if that’s what she thinks. I’ve never been privy to much of the inner workings of her mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps that’s for the best.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure.” Matthew’s voice was jovial. They had arrived in the back of the room, where two men, the Lord Grantham (Reinhard presumed) and another man he didn’t know, were watching their approach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Grantham,” Matthew said, “I don’t believe you’ve had the occasion to meet Admiral Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I have not.” The Lord Grantham was a tall man, taller than Reinhard, and broad shouldered. He gave Reinhard the same assessing look that his wife had, but Reinhard knew the criteria were quite different. When they shook hands, he kept his grip firm. “I’ve certainly heard about you, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can never tell if I have a good reputation or a bad one,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is a funny thing,” Lord Grantham agreed. “But certainly in person you leave a different impression than the one I had been picturing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An interesting reputation is more trouble than it’s worth, in that respect.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you met the Duke of Crowsburg?” Lord Grantham asked. He turned to the other man who had been listening to Lord Grantham’s greetings. The duke was slender, shorter than Reinhard, and with an aristocratic face and a delicate bearing. He cocked his head at Reinhard, and this appraisal had something quite different in it, indeed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We haven’t met,” Reinhard said, “though I believe we have mutual friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a pleasure, Count Lohengramm,” the duke said, extending his hand, which Reinhard shook. “But on the contrary to Count Grantham, I find your reputation matches you exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume the difference is due to the sources you’re listening to,” Reinhard said. “I don’t have much of an opinion of court gossip.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To read the papers and see the numbers regarding your work in the fleet, and to listen to some of the talk, it would be as if there were two different Count Lohengramms running around. You don’t have a brother, do you?” Lord Grantham was joking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only my sister,” he said. “Upon whom my successes are blamed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I believe I did meet your sister at Neue Sanssouci, once,” the duke said. “You look quite alike. But she was too quiet. I assume you aren’t quite as much of a wallflower.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps my sister has reasons for not being so friendly to the men of the court.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I wouldn’t presume to bother His Majesty’s favorite,” the duke said, smiling. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you met my sister?” Reinhard asked Lord Grantham.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only for a moment,” he said. “I admit I haven’t spent as much time in the palace as some other people. That’s what comes of living most of the year off Odin. You seem to spend most of your time in space, so I suppose you’d understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Recently, yes,” Reinhard said. “This, I think, is the longest I’ve been without an official deployment in quite a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know when you’re expecting to go back out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve heard a rumor about late December, but as far as these things go, I wouldn’t put too much stock in rumors.” Reinhard tossed his hair. “I won’t mind going back out. It’s tiring to not have something I can accomplish.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps you haven’t been spending enough time on Odin to appreciate the charms of staying on it,” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you travel much?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I visit my holdings at least once a year,” the duke said. “But I also travel to Phezzan often. Have you ever been?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reinhard said. “Even if I had the time, it’s discouraged for active service fleet to travel there.” Matthew was nodding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah,” the duke said. “More’s the pity. You’d like it there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would I?” Reinhard intoned, voice quite dry. “I’ve never much approved of deregulated markets.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phezzan’s a beautiful planet,” Lord Grantham said. “Cora is from Phezzan, so we’ve visited her family there many times.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you don’t mind me asking, how did Lady Grantham end up back in the Empire? If I were a native Phezzani, I don’t know if I could bring myself to leave,” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like to think it was because the old world charmed her,” Lord Grantham said. “But she was here with her father on business, which was how we met. And I’m very glad that we did.” He smiled. “Let me introduce you to my daughters.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Reinhard said. He nodded to Matthew and the duke, and allowed Lord Grantham to lead him over to where three young women were standing. The oldest was probably around Annerose’s age, while the youngest was perhaps a little younger than he was. The women had been watching his conversation with Lord Grantham like hawks, though they had been trying not to look it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I present you my eldest daughter, Mary; my middle daughter, Edith; and my youngest, Sybil.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard greeted each of the three in turn. Mary was a beautiful woman, with dark hair set in a perfect updo, diamonds glistening at her collarbone. She held herself with a regal bearing, her smile never even approaching her eyes. Edith was blonde, with an aquiline nose, and she looked at Reinhard with a naked curiosity. Sybil was lively and charming in the way she introduced herself, exclaiming, “I’m so glad to meet you at last!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t realize that there was anyone waiting on me,” Reinhard said. Beside him, Lord Grantham nodded, then stepped away to speak to some of the other people in the room, leaving Reinhard at his daughters’ mercy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re a curiosity,” Mary said, an aloof tone in her voice. “It’s not often that there are new figures in the court.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not in the court,” Reinhard said. “I’m in the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s one and the same, isn’t it?” Edith asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps.” He turned to Sybil. “I hear it was you who extended me this invitation?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She flushed. “Yes,” she said. “How did you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness Westpfale told me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know Baroness Westpfale?” Edith asked, suddenly very curious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s a friend of my sister’s,” Reinhard said. “I could hardly avoid knowing her if I tried.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She does have a way of inserting herself into your life,” Edith said. “I love her, but she is quite strange sometimes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard cracked a genuine smile at that. “I’ll refrain from repeating that to her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edith smiled back, meeting his eyes. “Much obliged.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly. “Count Lohengramm, I saw some photographs of your flagship. It’s quite spectacular. Is it docked on Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As much as this was a clear ploy to get his attention away from the middle daughter, Reinhard couldn’t help but be drawn into a conversation about the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>

  <span>. Of the gifts the Kaiser had given him, she was by far the one he enjoyed the most, and not entirely for her practicality. She was a beautiful ship, sleek and white and of an entirely different lineage than the standard Imperial cruiser. “Yes, she is,” Reinhard said. “She’s in the military spaceport, outside the capital.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never seen a ship like the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde </span>
  </em>
  <span>before,” Mary said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s the first in her class,” Reinhard said. “Though I don’t know if construction has been authorized on further members of the class. I believe some of her shielding technology is not being produced at scale yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is she faster than other ships?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Flagships tend to be,” Reinhard said. “She’s lighter, also, which helps. Her engine isn’t that much more powerful than a standard battleship, but it is an iterative improvement.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We just spent ages on board a merchant ship,” Edith said. “It felt quite slow to me, but perhaps space travel always ends up feeling that way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span> is faster than any merchant freighter,” Reinhard said. “But most military ships are, except for some of the slower transports.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And she’s yours, right? You can take her wherever you want?” Mary asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have use of her at the pleasure of His Majesty,” Reinhard said, voice dry. “But so long as it is His Majesty’s pleasure, yes, I can take her where I like. But I primarily travel in service of the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mary just wants to convince our father to buy a ship of our own, or get a husband who owns a ship,” Edith said, a little bit of a nasty tone in her voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard ignored it, but Sybil, who had just been listening, cut in between the animosity. “I would love to see your ship, sometime, if you wouldn’t mind giving a tour. I’ve never seen a fleet ship up close.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d be happy to show her to you,” Reinhard said. This was only half a lie. He couldn’t really resist the opportunity to preen over the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Mary looked like she was about to say something else, their conversation was interrupted by the announcement that dinner was ready to be served.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the assembled group headed into the dining room, Matthew caught Reinhard’s eye and held him back for a moment. The duke lingerd next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You feeling like you’ve been thrown to the wolves yet?” Matthew asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was vaguely aware that this was intended to be something of a matchmaking party,” he said. “Lord and Lady Grantham at least calculated the guest list perfectly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In what way?” Matthew asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are three of us and three of them,” Reinhard said. The duke laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are we choosing daughters?” he asked. “I’ll take Lady Mary, then, if there are no objections.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard gave him a sidelong look, but said nothing. The duke just smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We should go in,” Reinhard said. “Shouldn’t let them think there is a conspiracy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No more of one than they have,” the duke pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard ended up seated between Edith and Lord Grantham, which must have been a strategic choice on someone’s part. The dining table was full with people, but aside from the three young men and the Crawley daughters, many of the guests were older or at least already married. It was perhaps intended to disguise that this was a matchmaking event, but it didn’t succeed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As dinner was served, lively chatter filled the room. Across from him, the duke was flirting with Mary, while on the other side of Lord Grantham, Matthew was holding up a fine conversation with Sybil and Lady Grantham at the same time. Reinhard felt rather trapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The food was good, but every bite he took made him wish that he could bring some out to Kircheis and eat in the car with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could have a conversation with Edith-- that wasn’t a problem, exactly-- she was an intelligent and incisive young woman, but he had no intention of flirting with her, and he felt that speaking to her in any way could be construed as flirting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you planning to visit your estate, now that you’ve been granted one?” Edith asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I get the chance,” Reinhard said. “I might have gone during this period when I didn’t have fleet commitments, but I was told that it was more important to be present on Odin for the season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you find the season to your liking,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose I will find out if I like it or not. In any event,” Reinhard said, “I know very little about the running of a great estate. Herr Crawley has been walking me through the legal aspects of it, and from what I can see, the court appointed steward has been doing an adequate job. He is amenable to me hiring him to continue running the estate as my agent, so I think I will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It must be difficult to be the head of a noble house and in the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure that I will be able to figure it out,” Reinhard said. “In the fleet, I have been blessed with competent staff officers-- if the same thing is true of managing my estate, then I have very little to worry about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is everything about delegation?” Edith asked. “I’ve had very little opportunity to manage big projects myself, so I’m unfamiliar with how it goes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In some ways,” Reinhard said. “One man is not a fleet. You have to trust the people under your command to carry out the orders you give to them, and those people have to trust that you will issue orders that are sensible.” Reinhard thought it would be somewhat imprudent to mention how he once had participated in a mutiny, when he had been a junior officer. “But even if it is your men who will carry out your orders, the responsibility for their success or failure lies with you, in understanding what is possible and what is likely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edith nodded. “You seem to have a good understanding of that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps. I have also been very lucky not to have been faced with much of a competent enemy thus far.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Beside him, Lord Grantham laughed. “That’s one way of describing the rebel fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t underestimate them,” Reinhard said. “But at Tiamat, their command had difficulty adjusting to changing circumstances on the battlefield. That’s a weakness that I’ve seen from them several times.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your diversionary move was quite spectacular,” Lord Grantham said. “I don’t know if I would have led a fleet to do the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not something I’d like to repeat,” Reinhard said. “A trick like that works once.” And he had been forced into it, but if Lord Grantham didn’t know that, he wasn’t going to bring it up. “I don’t like to rely on tricks, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand that. I always was more of a by-the-books man myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not saying that everything should be by rote,” Reinhard said. “That’s how you end up with commanders who are unable to respond to unique circumstances, but always betting everything on a clever trick is the work of magicians, not military men.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s more important to be able to see through other people’s tricks than it is to perform your own?” Edith asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard took a sip of his wine. “Ideally, I would like to arrange things before I even arrive at the battlefield so that no tricks can be used against me. That’s not always possible, but the goal of </span>
  <em>
    <span>strategy</span>
  </em>
  <span> over </span>
  <em>
    <span>tactics</span>
  </em>
  <span> is to never allow your opponent an opening in which he could construct a trick.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Those are different?” Edith asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tactics are the moment to moment movements of your troops during a battle,” Reinhard explained. “Strategy is far more concerned with the whole course of the war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you consider yourself more of a strategist than a tactician?” Lord Grantham asked. “Most people would say the other way around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am a competent tactician,” Reinhard said, “but if I had to choose between the two, I would say that superior strategy wins wars. I have not yet had my strengths put to the test.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very true,” Lord Grantham said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s one of the problems that any military organization seems to face,” Reinhard said. “People can rise through the ranks on tactics alone, but when faced with coordinating something larger than a single battle, they come up short, or choose the wrong battlefield, or the wrong goals.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham nodded. “I have seen that, myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s worse in the rebel territories, of course,” Reinhard said. “There, there’s no chance of their talented admirals getting to set the strategic goals of engagements. They should consider that war is too important to be left to the politicians, but they don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You believe that it’s better here?” Edith asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard smiled. “The upper echelons of the fleet do tend to be filled with nobility, or the younger brothers of titled men, anyway. That gives them more of an ability to directly influence the course of the war. And Kaiser Friedrich has been remarkably hands-off when it comes to military concerns during his reign. But this system has its own problems.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like what?” Edith asked. “The way that everyone has their own faction?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s part of it. Centralized control of the military is something that the rebels do right. But what I meant was that my detractors are not without merit in some of their criticisms: although I have survived on my talents, the only reason I have been given as many opportunities to demonstrate my talent is because my sister and myself are favored by His Majesty. There are talented people who languish without opportunities to advance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, the fleet provides more of that opportunity than anything else,” Lord Grantham said. “There’s certainly no other venue where a young man from a poor family could make his mark on the universe. It’s good that they have the chance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you know many men from poor families who used their compulsory service to become successful?” Reinhard asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Certainly,” Lord Grantham said. “My valet, Bates, I met him when he was my soldier-servant in the fleet. He’s a success story if there ever was one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a way to cross that great divide, anyhow,” Lord Grantham said. “Do you have a good man like that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reinhard said. “I haven’t found it necessary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, we mustn’t let Granny hear that,” Edith said. “She’ll be as scandalized as when she found out that Cousin Matthew didn’t have a valet before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like Herr Crawley, I’m used to living a very simple life,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you enjoy being in the fleet?” Lord Grantham asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard was brought up short by the question. He didn’t have an answer. “It’s the only path I could have ever chosen,” he said. “And it suits me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Certainly it does,” Lord Grantham said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you enjoy being in the fleet?” Reinhard asked. Lord Grantham had been a rear admiral when he retired.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, when I was in it, I think I would have told you that I didn’t, but I was sad to leave it, and if anyone said they needed me back, I would go back in a heartbeat.” He drank his wine. “But I suppose it’s a chapter of my life that’s long over.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What made you retire?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Family, in the end. I found myself resenting time I spent away, especially from Lady Grantham, and when my father died-- that was it.” His smile was melancholy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t let that dissuade you either from furthering your career or marrying,” Lord Grantham said hastily, glancing at Edith. “You have nothing but opportunities ahead of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t intend to leave the fleet,” Reinhard said. “As you say, my career is really just beginning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think marrying a soldier would be quite exciting,” Edith said. It was the poorest attempt at flirting Reinhard had heard yet, and he did his best to smile politely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the dinner proceeded through its courses with Reinhard growing ever more annoyed with being forced to remain, and his thoughts kept flashing back to Kircheis waiting for him in the car. For Annerose’s sake, he kept a smile on his face and when he couldn’t find something pleasant to say, said nothing at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After dinner, the whole gathering headed back out to a different hall, where the footmen stood around with platters of drinks, and music was put on to encourage dancing, though no one really was keen on taking up the offer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard found Matthew, standing off to the edge of the party, abandoning Edith, who rightly decided it was better not to push her luck and try to tag along.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I probably won’t be staying for too much longer,” Reinhard told Matthew. “I have to get home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pity,” Matthew said. “I’ve rather been enjoying having the company of someone who’s in my same strange social class.” He smiled at Reinhard. “But this will all take some getting used to, and I can imagine that’s true for you more than for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, this is family,” Matthew said. “They have to put up with me, even if I manage to put my foot in my mouth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you been doing that?” Reinhard asked. “You seem well behaved to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’d be surprised,” Matthew said, with a real undercurrent of melancholy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil unhappy with you?” Reinhard asked. “You looked like you were getting along fine with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil is wonderful, but…” He trailed off, and his eyes found Lady Mary, who was chatting with the Duke of Crowsburg across the room, smiling and touching his arm. The duke had a funny expression on his face, but Lady Mary hadn’t seemed to have noticed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go talk to her, then,” Reinhard said. “There’s nothing stopping you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would be impolite to the duke.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t have the right to claim another person,” Reinhard said. “Nobility or no.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Matthew said. “You’re right. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard just inclined his head, and Matthew took his leave, wandering across the room and inserting himself in the duke’s conversation with Lady Mary. The duke didn’t seem too upset by this, but he smiled at Lady Mary, gave her a little bow, and then exited the conversation, leaving Matthew to talk to her alone. Reinhard watched them idly for a moment, but then the duke came over to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see it was you who freed me from that,” the duke said. “I don’t know if I should thank you or curse you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were under no obligation to walk away,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not polite to monopolize a young woman’s time, I suppose,” the duke said. “But I’ve been looking forward to monopolizing yours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not planning to stay for much longer,” Reinhard said. “I have urgent business to attend to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A shame.” He licked his lips. “Baroness Westpfale should invite you to one of her parties.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Reinhard asked. “For all I appreciate the baronesses’ friendship, it does little to raise my stature.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because it would be entertaining.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In what way, I wonder? And for whom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke just smiled. “One more drink before you abandon society for the night?” He flagged down one of the footmen bearing drinks, who came over and held out the tray of champagne glasses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose,” Reinhard said, taking a glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just as the duke reached for a glass of his own, someone bumped into the footman holding the tray, and he lurched forward, startled. The tray wobbled in his hand, and his left arm jerked to steady it, but it tumbled over, upending every bubbling goblet directly onto the duke.</span>

  <span>Thomas was enjoying the dinner party that the Crawley family was hosting, as much as a servant could enjoy any event they were working. He liked seeing the guests as they arrived, though most of them were older friends of Lord and Lady Grantham. It was the two new men who had been vetted as potential matches for the Crawley daughters that Thomas was interested in seeing, more out of curiosity than anything else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He collected the Duke of Crowsburg’s belongings for him at the door and showed the valet he had brought with him where he would be sleeping. Since the duke’s estate was several hours distant, on the other side of the capital city, he would be staying the night. The duke didn’t spare Thomas much of a glance, which was not unexpected, already being busy talking to Lord Grantham. The duke was handsome, shorter than Thomas, and had a funny little smile on his face, one that made him seem above it all, even as he greeted the Crawley daughters warmly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other new guest was Count Lohengramm. The name was vaguely familiar to Thomas, though he couldn’t have said why until the man walked in the door, his chin high, looking for all the world like some god stepped out of a painting. This, then, was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Admiral</span>
  </em>
  <span> von Lohengramm, who, until very recently, had been called Admiral von Musel. Thomas had not been in his fleet while performing his service, but since Lohengramm had been the butt of any number of soldiers’ jokes, he couldn’t help but hear about him. In pictures, Lohengramm had appeared childish and almost plasticine, more like a delicate doll than a man. In person, however, he had a sharp, feminine beauty, one that naturally drew the attention of anyone in the room. His blond hair was as bright as the sun, and his eyes were the cold blue of a clear winter sky. It didn’t bother Thomas that Lohengramm’s gaze skated over him without acknowledgement, because he barely looked at any of the party guests with any more concern, even the ones he was speaking to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas remembered once, when he had been on Iserlohn, a fight had broken out between two enlisted men who had once been under Lohengramm’s command, and a table of soldiers who had been cracking jokes about “the admiral hiding in his sister’s skirts.” Thomas had stayed well out of the fight, not wanting to risk injury, punishment, or any attention at all, but he had always wondered what would cause two soldiers to risk so much for a man they couldn’t possibly have known. Down in the enlisted mens’ quarters, jokes about command were always well received, and most men wouldn’t step up to defend their captain, let alone a distant admiral they had never spoken to. But seeing Lohengramm in person, Thomas could understand why a fight would be so quick to break out. He had to wonder, if he himself had been assigned to Lohengramm’s fleet, would he have been so eager to get out?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The question discomfited him, and he spent most of the dinner while he was serving trying not to stare at the man too directly. He was too bright to look at, like a star. Thomas could tell he wasn’t the only one who felt this way about Count Lohengramm. The Duke of Crowsburg kept looking as well, even when he was supposed to be speaking to Lady Mary, his eyes flicking across the table to take in Lohengramm’s form, though Lohengramm, half-absorbed in talking to Lady Edith, paid him no mind at all, if he even noticed the attention. Matthew Crawley looked, too, though his expression was far more friendly than it was hungry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas had more of an opportunity to watch and listen after dinner, when he carried a tray of drinks around and offered them to the guests. Conversations floated past him, and the guests swirled into different constellations as they moved between conversation partners.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham flagged William down, and Thomas paid attention. “William, would you find Bates and tell him to come see me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here, m’lord?” William asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, here,” Lord Grantham said. William scurried off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas had no idea what that was about, but his curiosity wasn’t going to be assuaged until Bates showed up. He continued serving drinks, and was pleased to be flagged down by the Duke of Crowsburg, who was speaking intently with Count Lohengramm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One more drink before you abandon society for the night?” the duke asked. A pity that the count would be leaving. Thomas kept his eyes locked straight ahead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose,” the count said, and took a drink from his tray.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door behind Thomas opened, and as the duke reached for a drink himself, someone crashed into Thomas’s back, as hard as a shove. He stumbled forward, and the tray slipped in his hand, all the champagne glasses wobbling. His left hand, no longer a part of him, was unable to right it, and Thomas watched in fascinated horror as the whole tray of drinks tumbled onto the Duke of Crowsburg’s chest, then fell to the floor, shattering and tinkling in brilliant, fragmented shards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Count Lohengramm somehow managed to catch the tray itself before it fell to the ground, and he held it back out to Thomas as they stood in the sudden, awkward silence that followed the crash. Out of the corner of his eye, Thomas saw Bates and William move out from behind him towards the edge of the room, out of the oncoming tirade that was Lord Grantham, whose face was red. Thomas’s own anger at those two, who he was sure had conspired to push him (it didn’t matter which one had done it) was enough to insulate him from Lord Grantham’s wrath, at least for a moment, standing straight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good gods man! What the devil have you done?” Lord Grantham demanded, then quickly wiped the vitriol out of his tone as he realized that solving the situation with the victim was more important than berating his staff.  “I deeply apologize for this, Your Grace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke was wiping himself off, swiping his hands uselessly down the lapels of his jacket. His eyes flicked to Count Lohengramm for a moment, checking his reaction to the situation, and when he saw that Lohengramm was impassively continuing to hold the tray out to Thomas, he made the clear decision to smile and moderate his own voice. Though Thomas was still frozen in stasis, he couldn’t help but notice that-- the duke taking cues from his social inferior. “It’s no matter, Lord Grantham,” the duke said. “Since you’re generously allowing me to stay the night, at least I won’t have to drive home in it. I think I’ll just turn in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham seemed about to object, opening his mouth, but realized that he couldn’t. “Of course,” he said. “William, please show His Grace to his room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, m’lord.” William seemed quite grateful to escape the scene of his crime.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas finally came to his senses enough to accept the outheld tray from Count Lohengramm when he said, “I think I will be going as well, Lord Grantham. I have an early appointment tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This, Lord Grantham could object to. “Must you?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have been very pleased to meet your daughters, but I’m afraid I can’t stay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, before you go, let me at least introduce you to Bates, whom I was telling you about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lohengramm took a breath, about to object, then his lips twitched in remembrance of something, and he sighed. “Yes, of course,” he said, relaxing his shoulders deliberately and allowing himself to be led away from the messy scene that Thomas was standing over, half-forgotten. William must have told some of the maids to come in and clean it up as he left with the duke, because Anna appeared with a bin to clean up the broken glass, giving Thomas a look that he couldn’t interpret.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hastily left the room, abandoning the drink tray that Count Lohengramm had passed off to him on a random table in the hall. As soon as he was in the dark and cool recesses of the house, away from the overbearing brightness and noise of the party, the panic set in, and the walls closed in around him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was not a ship, he reminded himself. He was not trapped here. There was air outside these walls, however little there felt like inside them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas hurried through the empty hallways, his own footsteps sounding in his ears, and then broke out of one door into the cold night air, stars twinkling above, light from the windows suffusing out in a yellow haze over the parked cars assembled in the lot at the side of the house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Trying to steady his breathing, Thomas leaned against the heavy stone wall of the house, then fished deep in his pockets for a cigarette and his lighter. He found both, and shoved the cigarette in between his lips with his left hand, though it shook. When he tried the lighter with his right, it clicked and sparked but did not light: empty. He tried several times, futile though he knew it was, then swore with a shuddering breath, “Damn,” resting his head back on the cold stone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Need a light?” an unfamiliar voice asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas lifted his head. How had he not noticed the other man there, leaning against one of the cars and looking up at the sky? He was tall, broad shouldered, and with a halo of frizzy red hair that caught the foggy light out of the windows. He wasn’t wearing any particular uniform, but he had probably taken off his chauffeur’s jacket and left it in the car he was leaning against. He was Thomas’s age, or maybe a little younger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’ve got one,” Thomas said. He was past the point of being embarrassed, though at least this man couldn’t possibly have seen his disaster inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t offer if I didn’t,” the man said, walking over. He had a confident, easy stride, and he smiled at Thomas, his eyes crinkling up in a way that made him look genuine. His face was handsome, Thomas could see now that he was closer. He pulled a lighter from his own pocket and lit Thomas’s cigarette for him, then leaned against the wall next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Want one?” Thomas asked, holding out another cigarette.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t smoke,” the man said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you carry a light, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fleet habit,” the man said. “Gives people a chance to like you, if you can offer one to them, I’ve noticed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas laughed, a dry sound. “Suppose that’s true. Who’d you come here with?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Lohengramm,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.” Thomas took a drag of the cigarette. His hands were still shaking, but the ritual was already helping. The smoke drifted up to the sky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You work here?” the man asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For the moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s your name?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas. You?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Siegfried. It’s nice to meet you, Thomas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas nodded. They were silent for a moment. Siegfried seemed content to just lean and look at the stars, but there was something about him that made Thomas want to talk. “Do you like working for Count Lohengramm?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very much so,” Siegfried said. “Why do you ask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just wondering,” Thomas said. He blew some smoke away from Siegfried. “Seems like the kind of man who gets loyalty from a certain type of person, and hated by most everybody else. From what I’ve seen, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried tilted his head. “What have you seen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing,” Thomas said. “Just the talk, when I was in the fleet.” He shrugged. “Am I wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Siegfried said. “But do people in there like him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure,” Thomas said. “Lord Grantham wants to talk his ear off about the fleet, and the Duke of Crowsburg seems to be the sort that finds him interesting. And the young ladies, of course.” He took another drag of the cigarette.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s it matter to you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll admit it will be a more cheerful drive home if Lord Reinhard has had a good evening, rather than a poor one.” Siegfried smiled, a gentle expression, and Thomas laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He isn’t looking for more staff, is he?” Thomas asked. “Valet, or anything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shame, if he is a good employer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He treats people under him with respect,” Siegfried said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘S more than most do, that’s for sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you looking for a new job?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably will have to. Though I suppose there was no point in even asking after Count Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He watched me drop a tray of drinks on the Duke of Crowsburg.” By now, Thomas’s hand had stopped shaking, and he could admit it without rancor to this man. He tugged off his white serving glove covering his left hand and looked at the burned flesh. “Doubt the Crawley’s will keep me on, what with that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are they really likely to send you out over an accident?” Siegfried asked. “Everybody makes mistakes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They need to marry off their daughters,” Thomas said. “And if the staff go around offending every duke and count they invite around, they won’t have an easy time of it.” He didn’t mention the fact that it had been only Count Lohengramm’s total look of indifference that had perhaps saved him from being fired on the spot. “I was already a charity case anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried looked at Thomas’s burned hand without comment on it. Thomas snuck a glance at his face, and, while it revealed nothing of his inner thoughts, his expression bore no trace of the kind of disgust that Thomas had grown used to. “I’m sorry that people feel that way about you,” Siegfried said. “I’m sure it’s not true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas shrugged, and shoved his hand back into his pocket, crumpling his glove in his fist. “People feel the way they like about me. Never going to be able to change that.” He stared out into the dark trees past the cars. “I just wouldn’t have minded working for Count Lohengramm, I don’t think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If they do fire you, get in touch with me, and I’ll see if I can find something for you,” Siegfried said after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Awful generosity for a stranger.” Thomas looked at Siegfried, now much more considering, though Siegfried’s expression belied nothing, and he said nothing to that, either. “You got a number?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried jogged back over to the car, and looked around for paper and a pen for a moment. He came back with a business card bearing Count Lohengramm’s information, and he scrawled a few digits on the back before passing it to Thomas, who tucked it in his pocket. “Can’t promise I’ll answer all the time, but if you leave me a message, I do promise I’ll get back to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” Thomas said. “I appreciate it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope they don’t let you go, though,” Siegfried said. “From how I’ve heard it, they’re not a bad family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas shrugged. “Sure. They’re not like us, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re all human beings,” Kircheis said. “From noble houses to the rebel territories. And everyone’s going to have to realize that, sooner or later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Seems unlikely,” Thomas said dryly. “They’ve had some six hundred years since Rudolph to figure it. If they were going to they would have by now.” His cigarette had burned down to a nub, and he stubbed it out against the wall, though his fingers itched for another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Reinhard understands it,” Siegfried said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good for him,” Thomas said. “And good for everybody who works for him, I suppose.” He didn’t quite believe it, but there probably was something to the loyalty that Count Lohengramm inspired, aside from the way he looked. “But the rest of us have less understanding masters.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Grantham really wouldn’t listen to you if you explained that it was an accident?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He already knows it was an accident,” Thomas muttered. Though it had been intentional sabotage on the part of Bates and William, Siegfried didn’t need to know that. “That doesn’t matter. Nothing I say would matter. It’s the duke who was wronged, and Lord Grantham’s going to bend over backwards to make it right with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then apologize to the duke,” Siegfried said. “If he tells Count Grantham to forgive you, he’ll have to, won’t he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas laughed, then realized that Siegfried was serious. “That’s likely to get me dismissed for impertinence.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there a difference?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was perhaps the difference between leaving with a reference and without, but that was an abstract distinction, Thomas had to admit. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then it’s worth a try.” Siegfried smiled at him again, and put a gentle hand on Thomas’s shoulder. “Find the duke, and speak to him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mouth was suddenly dry when he asked, “And should I call you and tell you how it goes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried withdrew his hand, and Thomas immediately missed it. “If it goes well, then there’s no need to dwell on it,” he said. His voice remained kind, but his eyes were blank and empty once more. Thomas had stepped too far.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, thanks for the advice,” Thomas said. “I appreciate it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Siegfried said. “I’m sure you can make it right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was dangerous what Thomas was doing, but now that Siegfried had planted the seed in Thomas’s head, he wouldn’t have been able to stop thinking about trying to speak to the duke. In his mind, he replayed the evening, what he had heard of the duke’s conversations at dinner in his head. He hadn’t gotten much of an impression of him, certainly not enough to tell if he would be willing to forgive Thomas, but he had seen the way that the duke looked at Count Lohengramm. The way he looked at Lady Mary, whom he was trying to court, was with a pale shadow of the searching, hungry look he had thrown Count Lohengramm during the dinner. When Thomas had come over to give them both drinks, in the moments before disaster, the duke’s eyes had been trained on the count’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It all might have meant nothing. After all, Lohengramm was beautiful enough to turn the heads of plenty of people involuntarily-- there was enough talk about that in the fleet that it could fill a book. But it was the only thing Thomas had to go off of, and something that he could possibly offer to the duke in exchange for his good word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas crept back upstairs to the servants’ quarters and waited until the duke’s valet returned to the room he had been given for the night. Then, Thomas snuck down the stairs, keeping well out of the way of everyone in the house, and walked carefully down the main gallery to the bachelors’ quarters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hesitated for a long second in the dark hallway, the light from underneath the duke’s door landing on his shoes. Thomas looked back and forth to make sure that no one was coming. There was no one. The hallway was as silent as the grave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knocked on the duke’s door. There was a moment of silence, then the duke called, “Enter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas opened the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke was sitting in the armchair near the fire, a book laying casually down on his crossed knees. His dressing robe was only loosely tied, revealing the curly hair of his chest. He looked up at Thomas with real surprise, but he kept his composure when he said, “Since you’ve taken the trouble to sneak up here in the middle of the night, I assume you want to close the door.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hastily, Thomas did. “I came to apologize, Your Grace,” Thomas said. “For what happened at the party.” He was nervous, and the way the duke was looking at him wasn’t helping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s certainly bold of you,” the duke said, “but gods only know why you’d do such a thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I be honest, Your Grace?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke waved his hand. “You’re already here pushing the bounds of acceptability, so you might as well…” He trailed off, a questioning tone in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas, Your Grace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go on, be honest then, Thomas.” The duke smiled, a strange expression. Thomas kept his hands behind his back, not looking him in the eye, back stiff, standing at attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had hoped if you said something in my favor to Lord Grantham, I would not be dismissed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Grantham will have forgotten the whole incident by tomorrow morning, as would I have, if you hadn’t come here,” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It wouldn’t have stopped you from courting Lady Mary?” Thomas asked, the words coming out as a surprise even to himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke laughed. “I am in need of a wife, and preferably a rich one. You haven’t posed anything like an obstacle to that, Thomas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no need for the duke to address him by name. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I ask you to say something in my favor regardless, Your Grace?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke didn’t say anything, but he shut the book on his lap and set it down on the side table, standing. He faced the fire, not looking at Thomas any more. “Why would you think that I would be willing to do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t,” Thomas said. “But I have nothing to lose by asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Thomas, surely every man has something to lose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas wasn’t sure what to say to that. It wasn’t often he found himself at a total loss for words. He fumbled for a moment, but then said, “If it’s pride and dignity, Your Grace, servants usually have to sacrifice that for the sake of employment anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke laughed and turned to face Thomas again. The light from the fire danced across his face, almost cheerful. “I’d think it’s more that you’re risking arrest by coming here. Another man than I would have called the police, or at least the butler, to get you out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke spread his hands. “Maybe I was bored enough to want to hear what you had to say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for not yelling for someone,” Thomas said. “And I apologize for intruding. I should go.” He stepped back towards the door, intending to make his exit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll tell Lord Grantham to keep you on,” the duke said suddenly, just as Thomas was turning the door handle. “If you’re really so worried about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas stopped and looked back at the duke. “Thank you, Your Grace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just have one question,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas’s heart was in his throat. “Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A man with nothing to lose is also a man with nothing to offer,” the duke said. “You don’t seem like the kind of man who would come here without any kind of plan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I said I had nothing, would you still say something in my favor to Lord Grantham?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke waved his hand. “I’m curious, not cruel, Thomas,” he said. “Was it family gossip that I should know before courting Lady Mary?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t worked at this house long enough to learn anything worthwhile,” Thomas admitted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a shame,” the duke said. “It’s useful to know what’s going on.” But he didn’t sound too disappointed. “So, what was it that you came to offer me, then?” The duke took a couple steps towards Thomas, whose hand was still on the handle of the door, ready to make his escape. He wasn’t sure if he believed that the duke would keep his word, or if he didn’t, that Lord Grantham would forget about the incident by the morning. He let his hand slip off the handle, back down to his side. The duke smiled, watching the movement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could have lied and said he had come to do nothing but beg, but he didn’t. “I thought I could do something for you, Your Grace,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?” the duke asked. He was quite close, now. Thomas could see the sparkles of firelight in his eyes, the even, tombstone white of his teeth. “And what made you think I would want anything that you could give to me, Thomas?” He had subtly changed what Thomas had said, but that didn’t matter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas met his eyes. “The way you looked at Count Lohengramm,” Thomas said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Lohengramm is talented and rich, and has a direct influence on the Kaiser,” the duke said. “I may envy him. But you couldn’t provide me with any of the things that Count Lohengramm has in abundance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Lohengramm would never give you anything,” Thomas said. “All of his power and influence-- he has too much to lose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you have nothing to lose?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Thomas said. “That’s right.” And slowly, he reached up towards the duke’s face. His white gloved right hand made contact with the duke’s cheek. Though the fabric caught on the hint of stubble on his skin, Thomas could feel none of it through his glove, only the pressure when the duke covered Thomas’s hand with his own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke tugged on Thomas’s hand, taking it in his own and looking at it. “You’re not waiting at table now, are you?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas couldn’t respond, because the duke was already pulling off the glove, pinching the fingertips one by one to remove it, sliding it slowly off of Thomas’s hand until the glove was dangling from the duke’s fingers, with Thomas’s wrist held steady with his other hand. He tucked the glove into Thomas’s pocket, then took his left hand from where it hung dead by his side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t--” Thomas said, finding his voice again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke paused. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s ugly,” Thomas said. He looked away, not watching the duke’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke ignored his protest and pulled off his left glove, too, revealing the pitted and warped red flesh of his hand. “I thought you said you had no pride to lose when you came here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas tried to pull his hand away, but the duke had it caught fast, his grip surprisingly strong for a man who had never lifted a finger in labor in his life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If men like you and I shunned every kind of ugliness,” the duke said, “we would be very lonely indeed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the duke raised his burned hand, Thomas’s mind flashed back to Count Lohengramm, who was singularly beautiful, and far out of reach of a man like Thomas, or even the duke, as he had said. Perhaps out of reach of everyone. He pushed that stray thought out of his mind; the duke was in front of him; the duke was pressing his lips to Thomas’s stiff knuckles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t feel it at all. Insensate flesh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was outside of himself, watching and listening like his eyes were cameras and his mind was behind a thick pane of glass. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone pushed me,” he said suddenly, as the duke pressed his nose between his fingers. “I wouldn’t have dropped the tray if he hadn’t. It still works, I--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas,” the duke said. His voice was warm, and it stopped Thomas in his tracks. The duke looked in his eyes for a moment, and dropped his hand, leaning forward to kiss him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That, Thomas could feel, and the bright pleasure of the duke’s lips on his was more powerful than the relief of a cigarette. The last time he had been with anyone had been months and months ago, in Iserlohn, some NCO whose name Thomas didn’t know and had never tried to find out. He had tried to forget how much he wanted it, because chasing that desire would have done nothing to help him survive. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>How convenient that survival provided an excuse here. It made it that much easier to shuffle closer to the duke so they were body to body, to run his right hand from the duke’s cheek, down his neck, feeling his hot pulse and fluttery breathing, over his collarbone, to where the silk of his dressing robe lay, pushing it down his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke tugged on his jacket and pulled him backwards, away from the door to the wide, plush bed, where he sat, and then then dragged Thomas down, so that Thomas’s whole weight lay on top of him. Their legs tangled together, the duke trying to draw him closer, into his skin, somehow. His hands messed at the back of Thomas’s head, carding through his black hair, bumping his ears in his haste.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke was eager and greedy when he kissed Thomas. Their chests rose and fell in tandem with their heavy breathing, and when Thomas ventured his tongue into the duke’s mouth, the duke sucked on it, which no one had ever done before, and that made Thomas lose whatever train of thought he had managed to hold on to up until that moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He propped himself up on his left elbow enough that he could trail his hand down the duke’s bare chest, pushing aside the dressing robe where it lay, and tugging free the loose knot at the waist. The duke slipped his arms out of the sleeves, leaving him naked beneath Thomas, save for his underwear, which concealed very little. Thomas was still fully clothed, even wearing his shoes on the bed. Nobles were so used to their valets and ladies maids seeing them undressed, perhaps this felt natural to the duke. If the positions had been reversed, Thomas wouldn’t have been so languid as the duke was, wrapping his bare leg around Thomas’s thighs, holding him close.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke tugged at the back of Thomas’s head. “So,” he said, breathless but smiling, “what were you planning to give me, Thomas?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas said nothing, but bent to kiss the crook of the duke’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t leave any marks,” the duke mumbled, but he closed his eyes and made no move to push Thomas away. Thomas suddenly wanted to bite him, the idea the natural kind of contrarian impulse that made being a servant or a soldier grate so much, or perhaps it arose from how grating it was to constantly be given commands. He satisfied the impulse by worrying his teeth across the duke’s nipple, making him laugh in surprise. “Oh, you are a devil,” the duke said, and pushed Thomas’s head down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then Thomas was slipping off the side of the bed to kneel, and tugging off the duke’s underwear, and the duke struggled into a sitting position, arms splayed out to his sides, completely bare before Thomas. He was still only half hard when Thomas opened his knees, stroking his right hand up the duke’s soft thigh, feeling the bristle of hair over the pale and unblemished flesh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took him in his mouth, then. The duke’s whole body shuddered, then relaxed, settling into the feeling of it, and he stroked Thomas’s head, murmuring something pleasant and warm that was completely devoid of meaning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although his knees ached from being on the floor after a while, Thomas didn’t mind. He was enjoying himself-- he could admit that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke came without any courtesy of a warning, except that his fingers curled in Thomas’s hair, pulling it near-painfully. Thomas swallowed what he could, trying to make as little of a mess as possible, and stroked the duke’s thigh through it, until he let go of Thomas’s head and leaned back on the bed, letting out a shuddering sigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas pulled away from the duke, but he didn’t stand from where he was kneeling, just looked up at the duke, who had his eyes closed and his head tilted back to the ceiling, steadying his breathing. It took a moment for him to perhaps remember that Thomas was in the room, and when he did, he looked down at him and smiled. Thomas couldn’t have said what expression was on his own face, but whatever it was didn’t bother the duke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were right,” the duke said, “you did give me something quite worthwhile.” There was enough humor in his tone that it kept Thomas relaxed. He held out his hand. “Do you want--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should go, Your Grace,” Thomas said, standing. He was painfully hard himself, but if the duke touched him at all, he would come embarrassingly quickly. (Nearly two years of being in the fleet and having only tiny slivers of privacy in which to eek out a moment of relief led to developing certain mannerisms that were difficult to cure, even after leaving and having a room to himself.) There was some pride he had left, maybe, and he found he had no desire to further undress in front of the duke. He pulled his gloves back on and tried vainly to smooth out his mussed hair. The duke watched him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’d think we were on a given name basis by now, Thomas.” His disappointed tone stirred something in Thomas’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know it,” he admitted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phillip.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas smiled, and Phillip smiled back, far wider. “May I ask… Phillip--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you are going to court Lady Mary--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should think I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you like to see me again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like that very much,” Phillip said. “Would you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So long as I’m employed here.” Why was it that he needed to make everything so harsh? He hated himself for that, but it was too late to change the way the words came out. They were said, and there was no way to take them back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I keep my promises, Thomas,” Phillip said. His tone and eyes were soft. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas nodded. “Goodnight, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight.”</span>

  <span>Sybil came down to breakfast the next morning, expecting to be the second one down after her father, as she usually was, but instead she found that she was nowhere near the first at the table this morning. Her father was in his usual place, but the Duke of Crowsburg sat next to him, a strange expression on his face as he stirred sugar idly into his coffee and half-listened to what Mary was saying. Edith was also down at the table, and it couldn’t have been clearer that she was only there to annoy Mary.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil slid into her seat. “You’re both up early,” she said to Mary and Edith.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t want Philip to leave without getting a chance to say goodbye,” Mary said. She cocked her head charmingly at the duke. “I was a little worried that the little accident last night might have made you too eager to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke laughed. “Oh, no. I wouldn’t begrudge you a thing like that.” He smiled at Mary. There was some falseness there, but Sybil had to think that no one ever could really enjoy having their outfit ruined and their evening spoiled. “These things happen sometimes. You won’t punish that man, will you, Lord Grantham?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil’s father looked up from his newspaper. “I was planning to agree to whatever Carson-- our butler-- suggested. It’s much more his purview than mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid that it’s my fault, in a way,” Mary said. “I do believe I encouraged Carson to take Thomas on, even though he had some sort of </span>
  <em>
    <span>problem</span>
  </em>
  <span>. It seems he isn’t as up to the task as I had thought.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke shook his head. “No, no, I’m sure that’s not the case. I don’t think it had anything to do with his hand. In any event, it would be a shame to have a man without work because of a mistake. No one could have held on to a tray with a knock like the one he got.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No one seemed to understand how to respond to that. “Well, if you feel that strongly about it,” Mary said. “It’s kind of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it?” the duke asked. He returned his attention to his eggs and sausage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Most men would have a harder time brushing off an insult to their dignity like that,” Edith said. Mary glared at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Forgiveness is a virtue,” Sybil cut in before Mary could say something to Edith.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe that causing a scene with your household staff would have done very much to endear me to your family,” the duke said. “Especially since I was taking advantage of your generosity already.” He chuckled. “Besides, it’s not as though I could challenge him to a duel. That’s the real kind of satisfaction people want for injury.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And would you like to be endeared to us?” Mary asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t mind it.” The duke’s small and strange smile was back on his face. Edith scowled into her coffee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been meaning to ask,” Lord Grantham said, “are you much of a hunting man?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m more of a city fellow, I’ll admit,” the duke said. “I’ve gone shooting a few times, and I can ride, but I’m sure I don’t hold a candle to good country stock like yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a matter of practice, I’m sure,” Mary said. “If you like to ride, I’d love to show you around the estate here. There’s some wonderful trails.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not today, I’m afraid,” the duke said. “I haven’t brought the right clothes. But some other time, certainly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been thinking of holding a hunt, later in the month,” Lord Grantham said. “It’s the start of deer season, after all, and I’d like to make the best of the weather while it lasts. Would you be interested in such a thing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So long as you can put me up for the night afterwards, I could hardly say no,” the duke said. “Just let me know the day, and I’ll make time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think that Count Lohengramm would like an invitation as well? You seemed to be getting on with him, Edith.” Lord Grantham tacked on that last part as though he couldn’t quite believe it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edith seemed surprised to be asked. “I’m not sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I found him to be quite different in person than his reputation suggested,” the duke said. “But I have heard that he is a sporting type.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What kind of sports?” Edith asked. Mary made a face that she hid behind a bite of toast. It was probably only the duke’s presence that prevented Mary from making some sort of remark.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I don’t know. I believe he fought a duel on behalf of Viscountess Schafhausen a few years ago now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume he won?” Lord Grantham asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think it was called a tie,” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hunh. Well, I’ll invite him. No harm in it, anyway.” Lord Grantham paused for a moment, considering. “You know, I’d like to meet his staff, as well. Get a taste of how the fleet is being run these days. Make something of a party of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This pronouncement from Lord Grantham was met with nothing but an awkward few nods from his daughters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I ought to be going,” the duke said, wiping his mouth delicately. “I shouldn’t overstay my welcome.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re doing nothing of the sort,” Mary said. “I’m sorry that I can’t monopolize your time a little longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If there is to be a hunt later this month, I’m sure I will see you then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. Or perhaps we’ll encounter each other in the city?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps,” the duke said. “I always find the city a rather poor place for meeting people. An estate like this offers a much more charming milieu.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about your own estate?” Edith asked. Mary kept her social smile on and resisted shooting her a glare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid as a woeful bachelor, I don’t know the first thing about entertaining. I keep a rather minimal staff.” He chuckled. “I sometimes feel like I’ve lived my whole life as a guest at other people’s houses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t your mother used to entertain?” Lord Grantham asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, when I was young. After my father died, she didn’t have much of the heart for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah,” Lord Grantham said. “A pity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke smiled. “Is it? I believe it’s a relief: I’d make a poor host. I often find in a large party of people, there’s only one who I would like to speak to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heavens,” Mary said. “I hope all of our guests didn’t bore you last night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at all,” the duke said. “I was quite pleasantly surprised.” He stood. “I really must be going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham and Mary also stood. “I will let you know about the hunt,” Lord Grantham said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I look forward to it.” They shook. The duke turned to Mary and gave a neat little half-bow. “It has been a pleasure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad,” Mary said. “I look forward to seeing you again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson was waiting at the door to show the duke out, but he paused in the doorway. “I say, if I am going to be coming back around here, you might tell that man-- what did you say his name was?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas,” Mary supplied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well you might tell Thomas that he doesn’t have to worry about me.” And with that, the duke vanished out the door into the hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Mary said, unsure of how to follow that up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He seems nice,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s just putting on a show,” Edith said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wonder why you would find it hard to believe that there are people in the world who are capable of being sincere,” Mary said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s because I’ve had rather few examples.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham looked like he wanted to make his escape, but at that moment, Carson returned to the dining room bearing the mail. Most of it was for Lord Grantham, which kept him at the table, but one delicate blue envelope was for Sybil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s that from?” Mary asked as Sybil opened it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness Westpfale,” Sybil said, examining the pretty handwriting on the card. Even though her father was in the room, and her parents did not exactly </span>
  <em>
    <span>approve</span>
  </em>
  <span> of Maggie, Sybil couldn’t keep the happiness out of her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what’s she doing writing to you?” Edith asked, leaning over to peer at the card in Sybil’s hand. She made a face when she read it. “It seems strange that she wouldn’t invite all three of us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil thought of admitting that it was because she had done Maggie a favor, but instead she said, “I can ask if you can come, if you want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come to where?” Lord Grantham asked, suddenly paying attention again, after he had sorted through his own mail.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness Westpfale has invited me to dinner,” Sybil said. “Next week.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At her house?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your grandmother wouldn’t approve of that,” Lord Grantham said. “I heard her describe Baroness Westpfale as running a </span>
  <em>
    <span>den of iniquity</span>
  </em>
  <span>, several years ago.” Sybil could just picture her grandmother saying that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s not that bad, Papa,” Sybil said. “I think she’s perfectly charming.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to ask her if you can come?” Sybil asked Edith. “I can, if you want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s nothing worse than being an uninvited guest,” Mary said. “It should be beneath you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t seem like Papa even approves of you going,” Edith said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alone?” Lord Grantham looked her over. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Edith comes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to go,” Edith said. This was just petulance, and Sybil shot a glare at Mary for ruining it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sudden, cheeky thought flashed through Sybil’s mind. “What if I asked Cousin Matthew to come with me?” she asked. “He knows Baroness Westpfale, and I’m sure you could trust him to look after me, couldn’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary stifled a strange expression. “And what makes you think Cousin Matthew would want to go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think he’d mind,” Sybil said. “Who doesn’t like going to a dinner party? Please, Papa?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Matthew agrees,” Lord Grantham said. “Though I rather hope he doesn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Sybil said. “I’ll call on him today and ask.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father frowned into his coffee.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sybil decided that the best way to convince Matthew would be in person, so she borrowed Tom and a car to go in to the capitol, and showed up at the law firm where Matthew was a partner. She had arrived right before lunch time, and asked the secretary to let him know that she was there. The law office’s waiting room was professional, if not overly luxe. From behind the heavy wooden door with its rippled glass window, Sybil could indistinctly see suited men passing by and hear the low tones of conversations in the hall. This was a busy place, and when Matthew stepped out to see her, she felt a little bad about the harried expression on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cousin Sybil,” he said. “I certainly was not expecting to see you today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry if I’ve interrupted something,” she said. “I don’t have urgent business-- I really have just come to bother you. I can go, if you’re busy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was just about to get lunch,” Matthew said. “If it’s something that can be discussed over a sandwich…?” He trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil smiled. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He led her out of the law office and just down the blustery street. Sybil waved at Tom, who was waiting in the car, as they passed, and indicated that they would be heading into the pub on the corner. It was a dark and bustling place, and Matthew was clearly a regular, because he greeted a few of the waitstaff by name as he walked past the bar and slid into a booth in the corner. “I’m sorry that this probably isn’t quite the setting you’re used to dining in,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s nice,” Sybil said, looking up at the moose head mounted over their table. “I promise I won’t take up too much of your time. It seems like it’s very busy in there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I have some time,” Matthew said. “I don’t have any clients I need to meet with this afternoon, just trying to solve an issue with a will--” He cut himself off. “You’re lucky that client privilege prevents me from talking about it, or I might start complaining to you. I’m sure you’d find it dreadfully boring.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m sure I wouldn’t,” Sybil said. “I enjoy learning about things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You say that,” Matthew said, “but if I got going on some sort of tangent about historical architecture or property law, you’d fall asleep on me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I swear I wouldn’t,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I make a confession to you?” Matthew asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had a nightmare last night that I was with your family, and for some reason I couldn’t stop myself from going on and on about work, and I could </span>
  <em>
    <span>tell</span>
  </em>
  <span> that everyone found it so crass and boring, but I just kept going.” He made a rather chagrined expression. “You must promise me that you’ll stop me if I do start going on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I would be interested,” Sybil said. “As for everyone else, Mary has no trouble walking away from someone who bores her. And Edith--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew didn’t stop his grimace when she mentioned Mary, but the waitress was coming over to take their orders, and so their conversation was thoroughly derailed. When she had gone, Matthew asked, “So, what is it that you came to see me about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil put her most charming smile on. “I came to ask you a favor, I’m afraid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m happy to help, if I can. I’m not sure what I can do for you, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you know Baroness Westpfale,” Sybil said. “She hasn’t invited you to a dinner party, has she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know the baroness as a client,” Matthew said. “I don’t think we’re exactly on dinner party terms. Why do you ask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil pulled the invitation she had received from her pocket and slid it across the table to Matthew. “I want to go, but Papa says I need an escort. I said that you would come with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew looked the invitation over. “Look, Sybil--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew slid the card back towards her. “I think I need to be clear,” he said, then coughed awkwardly. “You’re a wonderful girl, but I’m not--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stopped when Sybil began to laugh. “Gods, Cousin Matthew! Just because Mama sat us next to each other at dinner doesn’t mean I’m interested in </span>
  <em>
    <span>marrying</span>
  </em>
  <span> you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew smiled rather awkwardly. “I’ll admit, that’s a relief.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I do want to go to Baroness Westpfale’s party. Would you please come with me? As a favor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know who else will be there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Sybil said. She rested her chin on her hands. “That’s what makes Maggie so exciting, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s one word to describe Baroness Westpfale, certainly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil laughed. “Will you come?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If she doesn’t mind my intrusion. And if it’s just as your escort.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course . And she won’t mind: she owes me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does she owe you for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil just smiled. “Well, that’s settled then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do I need to wear anything in particular?” Matthew asked. “I’m afraid I really am out of my depth these days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anything like what you wore last night should be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The last thing I want is the baroness making jokes at my expense.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She isn’t mean,” Sybil protested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, but she is witty. That’s worse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil laughed. “Maybe you could marry her. She’s not married.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think we’d be well suited,” Matthew said, quite deadpan. “I’m just a city lawyer, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the future Count of Grantham,” Sybil said. “That means quite a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m joking,” Matthew said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you like being a lawyer?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are trying to get me to talk about work,” Matthew said. “Gods only know why.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m curious, I swear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I like being busy,” Matthew said. “And this is interesting work. You learn a lot about the way the world works.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m rather jealous,” Sybil said. She paused, then said, “I feel like I’ve just been coming to understand how little I really know about the world. And every time I find something out, it just shows me how much more I need to learn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like what?” Matthew asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil thought about the place Tom had showed her-- Triangle Street-- but she decided not to mention that. “Well, last night talking to someone like Count Lohengramm-- he lives a whole life in the fleet that I know nothing about. I’ve been in space, but I couldn’t tell you the first thing about how ships work, or even what they carry. And you have a whole career…” She trailed off. “I’m not quite sure what I have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re very intelligent,” Matthew said. “That counts for something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The waitress came back over with their sandwiches and a beer for Matthew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Sybil said. She nibbled at her meal. “But I’m not doing anything with it. Not like you are. And Papa-- he had a career in the fleet, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew chuckled. “Even though your grandmother thinks that having any sort of career is horribly middle class?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how he managed it,” Sybil said. “Maybe I should ask him. But that wouldn’t make any difference to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They ate in silence for a moment. “You could go to school,” Matthew said. “University. There are women’s schools, and even a place like Odin National University will take a few women every year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Mama would never want me to stay here on Odin by myself,” Sybil said. “It would be nice, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not even with a chaperone?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil laughed. “I don’t know if Aunt Rosamund could put up with me in her house for that long.” But then she sighed. The concept, now that Matthew had mentioned it, had caught her attention, and though she was throwing up every excuse now, she found the idea sticking in her teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was younger than you are when I went to school,” Matthew pointed out. “But I suppose it is different for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” She poked at her food.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d think about it, if I were you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What would I study?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Matthew said. “Whatever you like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I shouldn’t think about it,” Sybil said. “Granny would disapprove of fantasies taking up space in my brain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your family doesn’t have to approve of everything you think about, let alone everything that you do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Sybil said. She laughed. “They don’t approve of me going to see Maggie, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, maybe that’s a step in the right direction.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the car, on the long drive back home, Sybil rested her head on the cool glass window, even though it knocked her when Tom drove over bumps as delicately as he could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is something the matter, m’lady?” Tom asked after a while. “If you don’t mind me asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t mind,” Sybil said. “Just thinking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A mark for your thoughts?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you ever think about going to school?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom laughed. “Dreamed about it, more like,” he said. “I would love to go to school, but it’s not the kind of thing I ever had money for. I might have been able to get a scholarship, but I send money home to my family, and I wouldn’t be able to do that if I was studying instead of working.” He shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What would you study, if you could?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Journalism,” Tom said immediately. “I’d love to write for a newspaper, for real, not just pamphlets.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pamphlets?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Tom said, and backtracked a little, realizing he had revealed perhaps too much. “Just for some friends of mine. About local issues, mostly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I read one?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Tom asked. “Not saying no, I just don’t know why you’d be interested.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>would</span>
  </em>
  <span> like to know more about local issues,” Sybil said. “I feel like I don’t know anything about the world. Not at all. And I want to. You opened my eyes the other day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m honored that I could, m’lady.” His voice was carefully neutral.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s why I was asking about school,” Sybil said. “Cousin Matthew says I should try to go to university, get an education, so that I can </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> something in the world. Be useful. Not just a decoration for someone to put on their shelf someday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know it must sound like a stupid thing to you,” Sybil said with a sigh, leaning back in her seat. “I’m sorry, Tom. I don’t want to sound-- I know what I sound like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand what life is like for women. Even if you are a lady,” Tom said. “I do have a pamphlet about women’s rights, if you’d like to look.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like that very much,” Sybil said. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a problem, m’lady.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sat in silence for a moment, but couldn’t help but ask, “Who are these friends that you write pamphlets with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just people I know. Students, mostly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At ONU?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Tom said. “For the most part. There’s other people like me who just work, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do they like ONU? The ones who are students there, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Crawley really has planted a thought in your mind, hasn’t he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t help it,” Sybil said. “I’m afraid that once I have a thought, I have to keep chasing it. This always happens to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think that’s an admirable quality, m’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it?” she asked. “It has only ever annoyed Mama.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s good to chase the things you think are right,” Tom said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil nodded, and they lapsed into silence for a minute. “Could I meet your friends?” Sybil asked. “If I do try to go to ONU, I suppose I’d like to know that I could have friends when I get there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom took a long second to think. “I’ll give you some things to read first,” Tom said. “And if you’re still interested after that, then I can take you to meet them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Sybil said, voice very bright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you can’t tell Lord Grantham.” The tone in Tom’s voice, the utter seriousness of it, surprised Sybil, but he was probably right that her father would not approve in the least. She nodded in agreement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s easy to pretend to go out shopping,” Sybil said. “I think I can manage that, at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see you do just want me to kidnap you, m’lady,” Tom joked, smiling for perhaps the first time since they had gotten in the car. “Take you away to some place your family doesn’t know you’re going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I trust you not to lead me astray, Tom,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m grateful to hear you say it, but I can’t promise that you’re right.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>Carson was in a very strange mood on Tuesday night, the kind of tense that he usually only got when the household was on the precipice of hosting some sort of large event. But the hunt that had been scheduled wasn’t until later, and there was nothing else major on the calendar. His agitation seemed to circle around two wooden boxes on his desk in his office. Thomas had seen him carry them downstairs, and he was extremely curious about their contents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any idea what the bomb is in Herr Carson’s office?” Thomas asked O’brien when he passed her in the hallway. “Every time he walks by his office, he sticks his head in to make sure it hasn’t gone off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>O’brien scoffed. “Planning on stealing it, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just curious. Like you would be if you didn’t already know what’s in there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gifts,” she said. “To entice eligible young men.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?” When footsteps sounded down the hallway, Thomas got ready to pretend to be walking away, but the noise resided, leaving them in privacy to continue their conversation. “What kind of gifts?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go look yourself if you’re so curious.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I will,” Thomas said, and started off down the hallway. “He never locks his office.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pistols,” O’brien said, before Thomas could go very far. “For the duke of getting champagne dumped on him, and the other one, the pretty boy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas raised his eyebrows. “They wouldn’t use pistols for the hunt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t have anything to do with the hunt, except in His Lordship’s head.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what’s Carson doing with them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t exactly put something like that in the post, can you?” O’brien said. “He has to get them sent by courier, and in a timely manner because they’re meant to go with the invitation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t see what all the fuss is, myself. Isn’t that what they hire a driver for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Haven’t you heard? He’s busy driving the young ladies all over the country, day in and day out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hard to imagine that they have that many places to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>O’brien was about to say something in response, but she clammed up when a door opened down the hall. This time, the footsteps approaching down the corridor were real, and Thomas and O’brien had to abandon their conversation for good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas let the issue of Carson’s stress fall out of his mind until just before dinner, when he saw Carson talking to William in the servants’ hall. Thomas was mending the leg of one of the livery pants, which had a loose hem. Even with his bad hand, sewing wasn’t too hard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“William, I am going to need you to run an errand tomorrow.” Carson said, when William came in to get ready to eat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>William was visibly surprised. “Of course, Herr Carson.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The invitations for His Lordship’s hunt need to be delivered in person to the Duke of Crowsburg and Count Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t the duke live far, sir?” William asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His estate is near Wolf Point, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a long way by train, sir,” William said. “I don’t know if I’d be able to see both of them in a day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Train?” Carson asked. “You’d need to take one of the cars.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He can’t drive,” Thomas said, cutting in to the conversation. “Can you, William?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean, you can’t drive?” Carson asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>William flushed. “I lived in the city all my life before I came here, sir,” William said. “My family never owned a car.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gods release me,” Carson said, and started to turn away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas put his mending down on the table. “I’ll go, Herr Carson,” he said. “I can drive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will do no such thing,” Carson said. “Not after what happened with the duke.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t very well send Anna or any of the other maids, and I’m sure yourself and Herr Bates can’t be spared,” Thomas said. “And with Tom busy, there’s not many other choices.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson stared Thomas down. “And you think the duke, or Count Lohengramm, for that matter, would appreciate you showing up on their doorstep?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I imagine they’ve already forgotten my face,” Thomas said. “And if they haven’t, I would like the chance to prove that I’m capable of something, at least.” He flexed his gloved hand, then tucked it under the table. “And the duke did say not to consider it any further.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson grappled with the problem. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he could come to a conclusion, Thomas spoke again. “I could always just drive William, and have him actually do the delivery.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he had expected, Carson rejected this ridiculous suggestion out of hand. “And have no footman for the day? I think not. You’re not being paid to be the chauffeur, and William is not being paid to be ferried around the capital like a prince!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can do it, Herr Carson,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson scowled. “If any single thing goes wrong--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not incompetent,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson just shook his head and left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t know why you’re in such a hurry to volunteer,” William said, frowning as he sat down across from Thomas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad I can be useful to the household in some way that other people can’t be,” Thomas said, not even bothering to keep the smugness out of his tone. He finished hemming the pants and stood up to put them away.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thomas felt very, very good when he drove away from the Grantham estate the next morning, dressed not in his usual livery but in a nicer suit that Carson had found for him, perched proudly in the driver’s seat of a car that was far fancier than he would ever normally have the opportunity to drive. As soon as he was away from the estate enough that no one would see him do it, he rolled the windows down and let the fall breeze flutter across his face. The sunlight danced on the yellow leaves that scattered beneath his tires.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The freedom of escaping the Crawley household, at least for the day, made Thomas resolve to buy a motorbike as soon as he could. He wouldn’t be able to keep a whole car while he was working for the Crawley family, but something small he could probably find a way to tuck inside the garage, or behind an outbuilding, without anyone making too much of a fuss. And it would give him freedom to go places on his day off. He had come to Odin looking for some measure of freedom, so he should do what he could to claim it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The directions he had been given said to go to Count Lohengramm’s residence first, which Thomas didn’t mind at all. He wasn’t very familiar with the layout of the city, but when the GPS instructed him to turn towards a sleepy looking exurb, he wondered if he should call Carson to confirm that he was headed to the correct address.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned on to Linbergstrasse, then parked on the street in front of a two story house with a garden that someone had started to prepare for winter: a fountain had been wrapped in plastic sheeting to shield it against the snow. It was a nice house, to be sure, but it was not the house of a count. Still, he figured that before he called Carson to get a new address, he could dawdle and enjoy the day by just making sure by ringing the doorbell that he was in the wrong place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He got out of the car, and took the heavy wooden box containing the pistols intended for Count Lohengramm out with him. He strolled up to the door, and rang the doorbell. From inside, a woman called, “Coming!” and the door opened after a moment to reveal a chubby older woman in dowdy dress. She smiled up at him. “Hello, what can I do for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m here to see Count Lohengramm,” Thomas said. “Is he home?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman smiled wider. “Ahh, the admiral. I’ll see if he’s here.” Thomas hid his surprise that this was indeed the correct house, and he nodded his thanks when she let him in. He could see a dining room down the hall, and a large wooden staircase to the second floor. “Who should I say is calling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A messenger from Lord Grantham.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded, and hustled her way up the stairs, vanishing around the corner. She knocked on a door, and a moment later he could hear the tone of a quiet conversation between her and a familiar voice. The woman reappeared on the stairs a moment later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can come up, dear,” the woman said, and started to make her way down the stairs. Thomas hurried up, and they passed each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the top, he found none other than Siegfried, the servant of Count Lohengramm’s that he had spoken to outside of the party. His red hair was even more distinctive in the daylight, and when he saw Thomas he broke into a genuine smile, his eyes crinkling up. “Good morning, Thomas,” he said. “Please, come in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Thomas said, stepping in to the upper rooms as Siegfried held open the door for him. The suite was very nice: hardwood floors and exposed beams gave it a rustic look, but the fire crackling in the hearth was warm and the furniture was tasteful. There wasn’t much in the way of decor, aside from a bookshelf and what Thomas recognized as a photograph of Count Lohengramm’s older sister hanging on the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried stepped further into the living room and said, “Please, take a seat. Would you like some tea? I just brewed a pot. Or coffee?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas hesitated. “Is Count Lohengramm here? I have a message for him from Lord Grantham.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Siegfried said from the kitchenette he had gone to. “Lord Reinhard is at an OPS meeting today. Probably won’t be back until around 17:00.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should I come back later?” Thomas asked. “I have to deliver a message to the Duke of Crowsburg as well, so I’ll be back in this area fairly late.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no,” Siegfried said. Despite Thomas not having answered his question about beverages, Siegfried emerged from the kitchenette bearing a cup of tea in each hand. He held one out to Thomas, who was still standing with the pistol box clutched under his arm, and he was forced to put it down on the coffee table in order to accept the tea in his good hand. Siegfried smiled when he took it, and nodded at the couch. Siegfried sat in the armchair across from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas felt quite daring sitting down on the count’s furniture. It would have taken a lot of daring for him to do the same at Lord Grantham’s estate. But Siegfried seemed very comfortable, so Thomas relaxed, even if everything about this was strange. The tea was good, at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad to see that you’re still employed by the Crawley family,” Siegfried said after taking a sip of his own tea. “I hope you didn’t get in too much trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your idea of apologizing to the duke worked,” Thomas said. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re very welcome,” he said. “I’m happy that it turned out.” He looked down at the box on the table. “What message did Lord Grantham send you here to convey?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s an invitation for Count Lohengramm and his staff to attend a hunt at the Grantham estate,” Thomas said. “There’s a letter in the box.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas’s eyebrows shot upwards as Siegfried took the box from the coffee table, opened it without hesitation, and took the letter inside. He walked over to a writing desk in the corner and pulled out a letter opener to slice the envelope open. When he finished reading its contents, he looked back at Thomas, who was aghast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Lohengramm doesn’t mind that you open his correspondence?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not,” Siegfried said. “I handle most of his mail for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried sat back down and took out one of the pistols from the box. “These aren’t for hunting, are they?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, they’re just a gift,” Thomas said. “Lord Grantham can provide guns for the hunt itself if Count Lohengramm doesn’t have his own.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried nodded. He was turning the silver-handled pistol over in his hands, checking its mechanisms and looking at it with a keen eye. “These are quite nice,” he said. “Though I hope they won’t see any use. Please convey Lord Reinhard’s thanks to Count Grantham, and tell him that Lord Reinhard and a selection of his staff will attend his hunt.” There was unexpected steel in Siegfried’s voice, enough that Thomas didn’t question how a servant could dictate the schedule of a count.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried smiled again, and the tension in the room dropped enough that Thomas could relax back into his seat, sip his tea, and look around. Now that his task was accomplished, he was more curious than ever about the strange way in which Count Lohengramm seemed to live. “Is this Count Lohengramm’s estate, then?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “No, this is a rented house. You met one of the landladies coming in. Lord Reinhard has lived here for several years, when he hasn’t been in space. When he was granted his title—just a little while ago—he was given an estate, but he hasn’t yet been convinced to move into it. I’m sure he will eventually.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It seems strange, if you don’t mind me saying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Reinhard is very used to people finding him unusual.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he could stop himself, his voice half-bitter, Thomas said, “He’s lucky he can get away with being unusual.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried didn’t take offense and nodded, looking past Thomas out the window. “Maybe,” Siegfried said. He hesitated a second, and Thomas waited to see if he’d say something else. He did, in a contemplative voice. “Lord Reinhard has power, and talent, and some measure of protection—it does give him more freedom than most, in some ways. But I often get the sense that he would change nothing about himself if he had less of those things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you admire that about him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried’s smile was strange. “I encouraged him to move out of this house, if that answers your question.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t, but Thomas didn’t press. Although Siegfried was being quite garrulous, he didn’t want to overstep and end the conversation early. His curiosity kept him in his seat. Siegfried seemed to trust him, though Thomas couldn’t have possibly said why, and from that, Thomas was getting a much clearer picture of what the master-servant relationship truly looked like in this strange little house. “Suppose it’s hard for people who are born different to change who they are,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried looked at him for a moment. “The world is changing, Thomas. It has to, because people like Lord Reinhard are going to make it change.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have to see that to believe it,” Thomas said. “But good luck to him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “I’ll pass along your well wishes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas barked out a laugh. “Don’t tease me. He doesn’t need to know the opinions of a footman.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Reinhard likes to know that people are on his side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With some regret, Thomas finished his tea. “Will you accompany Count Lohengramm to the hunt?” he asked, gesturing to the open box with the guns on the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Siegfried said. “If you’re looking for a list of Lord Reinhard’s staff who will come, you can tell him it will likely be Rear Admirals Mittermeyer and Reuenthal, Captain Mecklinger, and Captain Kircheis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Thomas said. “Herr Carson will be glad to know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. If there’s any other logistics you need, feel free to call me, and I can help sort it out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do a lot around here, don’t you?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever Lord Reinhard needs from me,” Siegfried said.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the long drive to the Duke of Crowsburg’s residence, Thomas couldn’t stop thinking about Count Lohengramm and Siegfried. He couldn’t help but be jealous. It was clear that even if Siegfried was performing the duties of a valet or a man-of-all-work, he was also much more than that. Even if it had just been the casual trust that the count had in him—opening his mail!—Thomas probably would have been jealous. Certainly Bates didn’t open Lord Grantham’s mail for him. But it was undoubtedly more than that, and Siegfried didn’t mind that Thomas knew that it was more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although he tried to keep his attention on the road, his imagination kept wandering to Count Lohengramm and Siegfried alone in their apartment. Perhaps in the evenings, Count Lohengramm would sit on the couch before the fire, and Siegfried would sit at his feet. He pictured Siegfried dressing Count Lohengramm, running his hands down his side to clear wrinkles in his pristine admiral’s uniform. Maybe Count Lohengramm allowed him to brush his golden hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wondered what kind of lover the count was. The cool and detached expression that Lohengramm had worn all through the party gave no hints as to what he would be like, so Thomas was free to ponder whatever suited his fancy. It certainly was an appealing image to picture Siegfried on his knees before the count, the count’s fingers lost in Siegfried’s blood-red hair, his uniform trousers around his ankles. But it was equally thrilling to picture the taller Siegfried leaning over the count, splayed out and delicate on dark silk sheets, trailing his solid hand down the count’s chest as it rose and fell with his rapid breathing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thus occupied, the long drive went by quite quickly, and Thomas arrived at the duke’s estate in the late afternoon. The duke’s home was the kind of building that anyone would look at and know belonged to old nobility. Heavy stone atop a tall hill, imposing against the sky that was beginning to tilt towards sunset. There was the distant smell of the ocean on the wind, though Thomas rolled the car windows up as he drove through the gates. He was somewhat concerned that he might be interrupting the duke’s dinner, but there was no sense in dawdling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No one here knew him, and he wasn’t dressed much like a servant, so Thomas took advantage, and walked directly up to the main door after parking the car in the front drive. A stern looking older man opened the door for him and asked his business. Thomas stated that he was an emissary from Lord Grantham, and he was led into the library, which was dimly lit but well appointed. He didn’t sit while he waited, but did examine the trinkets that sat in a display case beneath one arched window: delicately carved little ivory figurines of dancing figures.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father collected those,” Philip said, coming into the room and startling Thomas. He shut the door behind himself, and when Thomas turned around, he smiled. “Isn’t it a little bold of you to come here, Thomas?” The way he pronounced the name, with a little trill, set Thomas’s heart beating just a little faster than it already was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m here on official business, Your Grace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so? I’m surprised that Lord Grantham would have you come to see me on official business.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I asked to come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, it was bold of you, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip came closer, standing near enough that Thomas could smell his cologne. He might have reached out towards him, but the damn box with the pistols in it was in the way. Philip noticed it, and nodded at it. “What’s this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A gift, from Lord Grantham, and an invitation to a hunt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, he had mentioned something about that.” Philip took the offered box, lifted the lid, raised his eyebrows, closed the lid, and set it down on a nearby table. “I hope he doesn’t expect me to hunt with those.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Thomas said. “He’ll provide guns during the hunt. That’s just a gift.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A strange gift for the man who’s intending to court his daughter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Lohengramm was also given a set.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was he, indeed? Did you deliver that one, as well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what did Count Lohengramm think about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wasn’t home when I delivered it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A pity,” Philip said. “I suppose I shall have to thank Lord Grantham somehow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s eager for you to marry Lady Mary. That would be thanks he’s looking for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke’s smile was thin. “It speaks badly of a woman for her father to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>too</span>
  </em>
  <span> eager to see her married, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t, particularly,” Thomas said, which made Philip laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s not going to stop me, anyway. Not unless I discover there’s a reason he’s so interested in marrying his daughters off.” He laughed, mostly to himself. “If it’s because they have a sullied reputation, I suppose I don’t have much right to complain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have a reputation, Philip?” Thomas asked, injecting a coy note into his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should hope not.” But his eyes wrinkled with amusement all the same when Thomas addressed him by name. Thomas took this as invitation to take a step forward, and he brushed his hand down Philip’s arm. Philip stilled Thomas’s hand with his own, catching his fingers. He glanced behind himself, more nervous than he had been in the Grantham house, and then pressed a swift, fluttering kiss to Thomas’s knuckles, then let his hand drop. “Not here,” he said. “Not now, anyway. I have a cousin coming for dinner in about a half hour.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We could be fast.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip shook his head. “Can you get into the capital easily, by any chance?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can take the train.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be in the city this Sunday. I’ll have a room in a hotel.” He walked away from Thomas and found a pad of paper and pen on the table, on which he scribbled down an address. “Come here at four.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing in the city?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip just smiled and handed him the paper. Thomas folded it and tucked it in his pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll have a good time,” Philip said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was wondering,” Thomas began, but Philip held up his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it something better discussed when we have more time?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Thomas hadn’t even broached the question, he felt like he was already being dodged, and he frowned. Philip smiled and pressed his thumb to the corner of Thomas’s mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t pout, Thomas” he said. “I will see you soon, and we’ll have all the time in the world. Besides, you should know that I keep my promises.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Although it was a long drive back to the Grantham estate, Thomas had no desire to make it go any faster. The day had been a change in his drudging routine, and he didn’t want it to end. Driving the car around was enough to briefly entertain visions of stealing it and driving off into the night, never to be seen again, but this was a less entertaining thought than picturing Sunday, and his promised meeting with the duke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As an excuse to himself for prolonging his trip, Thomas decided to make sure he knew where the hotel he was supposed to meet the duke at was actually located. He was going to have to get there by train and by foot, but even having a general sense of the area would help. He was still not very familiar with the city, and he wanted to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The city streets were quieter at night as he drove through them, traffic considerably lessened. He drove slowly, carefully taking in the sights, going through the brightly lit areas full of bars with their jaunty music spilling out into the street and the considerably stiller financial areas of the city, where all of the marble steps led to buildings silent for the night, with lone guards stalking through the lobbies. The GPS took him on a winding route, and even when Thomas saw the hotel, a nice place from the looks of it, he wasn’t sure if he would know how to get there by walking. He put in the location of the train station, to try to map that route, and drove along it, making mental note of the landmarks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he did, Thomas caught a pedestrian in his headlights, walking along swiftly and constantly glancing behind himself. Curious, Thomas looked closer, and realized with a start that the man’s face was familiar. Though the man quickly vanished from his view, Thomas would have sworn that he was Tom, the Granthams’ chauffeur.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quickly, Thomas turned around at the nearest intersection, causing the GPS to complain, and drove back to follow the man. He arrived just in time to see him enter a nondescript brick building, which only stoked his curiosity further, but did not allow him to confirm who it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He circled the block, wondering if the man he thought was Tom would come out again, but he didn’t, and so Thomas reluctantly turned back towards the Grantham house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he got back, the servants’ hall was mostly empty, except for Anna and Bates, who were sitting at the table, both reading books and sneaking smiles at each other. Thomas was happy to interrupt their moment when he came in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He held up the car keys. “Is Tom around?” he asked. “These are his.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What kept you out so late?” Bates asked. “It’s not that far of a drive to Wolf Point.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Traffic,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure there was,” Bates said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t seen Tom,” Anna said. “He might be in his room. You can always just leave the keys in Herr Carson’s office.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d prefer to give them to Tom,” Thomas said. “I don’t want to be accused of snooping.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there a reason you’d think someone would accuse you of that?” Bates asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It never hurts to be too careful, around here,” Thomas said. “If you don’t watch your back, someone might shove it, is all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bates stared at him, and Thomas turned and stalked away. He heard Anna ask, “What was that about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Bates replied, “He’s paranoid, that one. I wouldn’t pay him any mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas scowled and went to check Tom’s room. He wasn’t there. He stuffed the car keys back in his pocket. He could ask Tom where he was tomorrow morning when he returned them. Maybe that could be useful information.</span>

  <p>
  <span>Sybil lay on her bed and thumbed through the booklets that Tom had given to her. Some of them were just a few pages, a single broadside folded up to make a leaflet, but others were heftier, with cardstock covers and stapled pages. The writing was passionate and well done, though she couldn’t identify which books or sections had been written by Tom unless they had names on them (which most of them didn’t). As promised, the literature was mostly about women’s issues, and since it was published by a group comprised mainly of students at Odin National University, a lot of it was on the subject of the treatment of women at the university: which classes they were allowed to register for, how it was an unfair burden to them that they were barred from student housing and had to provide proof of an “upstanding” living arrangement, the concerns about their future employment, and other similar things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was fascinating. Even though the pamphlets were mainly lists of all the things wrong with the treatment of women at ONU, Sybil still found that each page she read sparked in her mind the image of herself joining those ranks of brave and intelligent young women-- women who were </span>
  <em>
    <span>making</span>
  </em>
  <span> something of themselves, despite the hurdles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sheer abundance of pamphlets made Sybil sure that there were plenty of other things that this student group had to talk about-- especially since more than half the authors’ names, when they were credited, were men; they couldn’t only be talking about women’s issues! She was desperately curious to learn more. She wondered how much more there was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She kept the pamphlets hidden when she wasn’t reading them, tucking them inside the deep pockets of a heavy fur winter coat that she wasn’t going to need to wear until much later in the winter. She would have to find a more permanent hiding spot eventually, especially if Tom gave her more material, but that would serve for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next opportunity she got, Sybil found Tom out by the garage. It was a beautiful sunny morning, and even though it was fall, the weather was graciously warm. The leaves on the trees were red and fluttering in the gentle wind. Tom had pulled one of the cars out of the garage and popped the hood, inspecting the engine for something. When Sybil approached, Tom turned and smiled at her, though he glanced around to make sure that there was no one else around. It was just them, and the breeze, and the birds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil,” he said, wiping his hands on his work overalls. “What can I do for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to say thank you,” she said, “for the pamphlets.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You enjoyed them, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did-- very much so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m glad,” Tom said. “Was I right that they’d be too scandalous for Lord Grantham?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably,” Sybil said. She frowned. “They’ve only made me more curious, I’m afraid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have I done you wrong by giving you ideas?” Tom asked, his mouth quirked in a funny smile. “Might not be good, for a lady such as yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil laughed. “Maybe. It’s already dreadfully stifling to listen to Mary and Edith fight over meaningless nothing-- now when they are I just know I’ll find myself thinking about escaping to somewhere where people talk about things that matter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think you will try to go to school?” Tom asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Sybil admitted. “I want to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound so sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound like it’s important to you.” He closed the hood of the car. “If I may say so, m’lady, you belong to yourself, and so you should live your life the way that will make you happy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that true?” she asked. “If I mentioned this to my father, it would make him… I don’t know what it would make him do. But there’s a way he expects me to be, and so that’s who I am. I don’t get to choose the role I’m playing.” She gestured around herself. “If I was somehow the heiress of the estate, wouldn’t in some way I belong to it more than I belong to myself? It would be my responsibility-- I think it owns my father, in that way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not the heiress, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, I’m just thinking. You might say the same thing about belonging to yourself to Mary, if she were to inherit, and I’m not so sure it would be true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Forgive me for saying so if it’s rude, m’lady, but I would not be having this conversation with Lady Mary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But even if you were the heiress,” Tom said, then trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You and your life-- that’s not something you can put money on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil wandered over to the low brick wall that edged the driveway, sitting down on it. When Tom watched her, she gestured that he could sit beside her, and he did, wiping his hands again, though it did little. “It’s not money, exactly. My parents wanted Mary to marry Patrick-- the old heir-- to secure their future with the estate. Even Cousin Matthew-- the estate and the title-- they’ve forced him to be someone he never expected to be. These things, Papa would say that the foundations that we build our lives around-- they give us the structure of who we are. If the estate or the title is your responsibility, it makes you into who it needs you to be. And if you took that away… What would be left?” She shook her head. “I’m sorry, I don’t really know what I’m trying to say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, go on. I’m listening.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like to think I have control over my life, but it’s not as though I could get up tomorrow and just leave this house and start a new life--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil looked at him. “Could you do that? Walk away from the life that makes you who you are?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Already have,” Tom said. “My family’s not on Odin. I paid a lot to get here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Sybil said. “I see. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom shook his head. “Nothing to apologize for. It’s what I needed to do.” He smiled at her. “I’m sure you could do the same, if you had to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” she said. “I guess I worry that even if I did want that, I wouldn’t be able to make myself reach for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“From where you’re standing, right now, what do you think it would take to make you change your whole life?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” she said. “I suppose it would have to be more than something like just wanting to go to school. It would be something I couldn’t live without, or couldn't live with.” She turned towards Tom, very earnest. “It would be hard, you see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you have your class interests, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil flushed and looked away. “Is that really what it is? I couldn’t turn away from being a lady, if I had to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Tom said. “There’s much more to you than just being a lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you’re right,” Sybil said. “But I’ve never been anything but a lady. I don’t know what’s underneath.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An intelligent young woman,” Tom said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil smiled, but it was wan. “I hope so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry for troubling you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s good to think about these things. I must be at some sort of crossroads, since my duty this season is supposed to be chasing a husband, and I haven’t really been able to get myself to do that.” She laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s no man who’s caught your fancy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“None that I could imagine myself marrying tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom smiled. “I’m glad you don’t have to marry one tomorrow, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s always next season, I suppose,” Sybil said. “And I’ll probably be a better prospect after Mary and Edith are settled. I’m the third daughter, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I say--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That I shouldn’t marry for prospects, but for love?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You took my words right out of my mouth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like to,” she said. “Certainly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will, then, if that’s what you’re really want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, what do I know?” He smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you know quite a lot. I liked what you wrote.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Must say, I’m glad to hear it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil hesitated. “Would you introduce me to your friends at ONU?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would,” she said, very earnestly. “I really would.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Given that Sybil didn’t think that Tom’s friends would appreciate meeting her very much, Tom was surprisingly quick in arranging a visit for her to see them. It only took a few days, and when he passed her outside in the morning, he whispered, “Try to go shopping this afternoon,” which she could certainly do. She would like to get a new dress for Magdalena’s dinner, after all, though if that ended up not quite materializing, she would manage without.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She told her mother this, who waved her hand and shooed her off, so Sybil was able to summon Tom with full permission, and drive into the city with him, giddy with excitement that she tried not to show.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are your friends like?” she asked as they drove. It was a misty fall day, the weak sun only serving to illuminate the haze. Sybil leaned forward in the back seat so that she could hear Tom more clearly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Smart,” he said. “Passionate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew that already,” she said with a laugh. “Are they like you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would it be a good thing if they were like me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Odin National University sprawled across one corner of the city, easily distinguishable by seeing the students in their uniforms strutting about the greens. Tom pointed it out as they passed, but they didn’t stop. “Our usual meeting pace is off campus, m’lady,” he explained. “Makes it easier for a working man like myself to get to it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you should just call me ‘Sybil’ while we’re seeing your friends,” she said. “I don’t want to feel like--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re putting on airs?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to be rude.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Fraulein Sybil,” he said with a grin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The building they eventually pulled up in front of was fairly far off campus, and in a much less well kept part of the city. It was an unmarked brick building, with windows far enough off the ground that they couldn’t be looked into from the street. It may once have been some sort of office building, but it gave very few clues about its function now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom got out and let her out of the car, then knocked on the door of the building. Sybil looked all around as they waited for someone to open it, and eventually, someone did, a gangly man about Tom’s age, with soft brown hair that fell around his face. He had a strong nose but a delicate mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look who the cat dragged in,” the man said when his eyes landed on Tom. “I didn’t expect you to come.” He was smiling, though, and he lightly touched Tom’s arm in greeting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When I say I’m going to do something, I do it,” Tom said. The man held open the door so that they both could come inside. The door led into a sparse office area, with bookshelves filled with bins of stapled pamphlets, and a single desk that guarded a door that led further into the building. No one was sitting at the desk, and it looked like rarely anyone did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is why we keep you around, I forgot,” the man said. “Even if it does mean you bring mystery women to our doorstep.” Sybil stood straight under the man’s studying gaze. He didn’t seem malicious, but his curiosity was tinged with distrust.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin, this is Fraulein Sybil. Fraulein, this is Martin Bufholtz,” Tom said. She was sure the omission of her last name did not go unnoticed. “She’s curious about ONU.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Among other things,” Sybil said. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Herr Bufholtz.” And she stuck out her hand to shake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just Martin,” he said, shaking her hand. “We’re all friends here.” He seemed to decide that she was harmless enough, because when he let go of her hand, he walked over to the door into the rest of the building and unlocked it, holding it open for them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other room was much larger, divided into two sections, one small area that had couches and a coffee table sitting on a worn rug, and the much larger area that contained large workroom tables, on which were spread out stacks of paper, large mock-ups of newsprint sections, paint and brushes, computers with dark screens, and equipment that Sybil couldn’t identify but assumed was for industrial printing or something like it. There were people standing around one table with coffee mugs in hand, arguing or discussing something, and they all looked up and stopped talking when Martin led Tom and Sybil in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Tom!” one of them called. “Long time no see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom lifted his hand in a wave. “Busy working, unlike you lot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man just laughed. Sybil noticed he was dressed in the ONU uniform, though he had taken off his jacket and tied it around his waist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is Sybil,” Tom said, pointing her out. “A friend of mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ignore us-- you’re trying to get that out the door before the game. Don’t let us disturb you,” Martin said, and hustled along. A few of the people around the tabe lifted their mugs at Sybil in an approximation of a greeting, then turned back towards the computer screen images they were all discussing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are they working on?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin laughed. “That? A student paper that they’re going to pass out at the football match tomorrow. It’s not particularly important.” Sybil got the idea from his tone that if it had been something important, she wouldn’t have been allowed into the room. He gestured to one of the couches over in the corner. “Can I get you some coffee?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you don’t mind,” Tom said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, thank you,” Sybil said. Tom sat down on one worn green couch, with just enough room for Sybil to squeeze in next to him. Martin returned with a cup of coffee for him, and then sat on the couch across from them, elbows on his knees, looking at Tom with a searching expression. Tom looked into his coffee cup and said nothing for an uncomfortably long moment, until Martin’s gaze flicked over to Sybil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Martin said. “How did you two meet?” There was an edge in the question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Work,” Tom said, before Sybil could answer the question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom, do you really think that I wouldn’t know what the names of every member of the Crawley family are?” Martin asked. Martin’s voice was somehow equal parts mild and cutting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom’s face reddened. “I didn’t know you kept that kind of tab on me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s occasionally useful to know someone whose paychecks are signed by a count, but you can only make use of that if you know what web of connections that opens up,” Martin said. “You told me Lord Grantham hired you-- I looked him up.” He smiled. “And </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>are dressed far too nicely to be a maid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Sybil’s turn to feel self-conscious. “I wasn’t trying to pretend otherwise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Martin said. “No, you didn’t get out of your car until your chauffeur opened the door for you. You couldn’t pretend, even if you wanted to.” If Martin had somehow been watching their approach, security around this building was tighter than Sybil had first assumed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to hold it against me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you?” Martin asked. “I think that’s usually the way it goes-- the elite hold their status over everyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s not like that,” Tom said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil hadn’t gotten a chance to defend herself, and when Tom did, she wondered if it was actually true. “I’m not asking for special consideration,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom did, on your behalf, by asking to bring you here. That’s special consideration in and of itself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And was I just going to not help someone who’s trying to broaden her worldview?” Tom asked. “I thought you cared about that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t have said yes if I didn’t,” Martin said. He looked at Sybil. “He argued very passionately for you, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I thank him for it,” Sybil said. “And I thank you for giving me a chance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome,” Martin said. “I’d like to ask again, and maybe phrase my question better: how is it that you came to know Tom enough for him to bring you here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil considered her answer very carefully. “He showed me Triangle Street,” she said. “When I was walking through the city to meet someone. He showed me the way, and told me what had happened there. It opened my eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some very strange emotion flashed across Martin’s face. “Remember when I took you there, Tom?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do,” Tom said. “It was as good of an education as I’ve ever gotten.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose I can’t blame you for giving that same education to someone else, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t realize historical truth was your sole dominion,” Tom said. Sybil looked between them. “If you had told me it was, maybe I would have been more selective in handing it out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin chuckled, but it didn’t break whatever the strange tension was between the two of them. “So, Triangle Street made you curious about the way the rest of us live?” he asked Sybil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It made me curious about all of the things I don’t know,” Sybil said. “I wanted to know more about what I could learn-- I don’t even have the sense of the scope of the knowledge I’m missing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s an admirable thing to understand about yourself,” Martin said. He relaxed in his seat and sipped his own coffee. “You think you could learn what you’re missing at ONU?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think I couldn’t?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think a truly worldly education is not one that ONU provides. It’s the university closest to the Empire’s seat of power, offering classes to sheltered young noblewomen.” He tilted his head. “But if you do want a broader scope, I suppose you’ve come to the right place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you study, to give you such a dim view of the value of education?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have a dim view of education at all,” Martin said, suddenly leaning forward again. He tucked his loosely falling hair back behind his ears. “I study classics, and I love it more than I’ve ever been able to explain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More than he could explain to me, anyway,” Tom said. “Though gods know he’s tried.” He smiled at Martin, making it clear that his comment was lighthearted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think it has value that people overlook,” Martin said. “I would never study anything else.” He looked around, his eyes settling on the people at the back table. “But Tom always reminds me that this isn’t the whole world. Everyone at ONU is luckier than most.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They keep me around just to remind them that people in the real world need to eat.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin frowned deeply. “That isn’t what I meant.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand what you’re saying,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose I’m going to get an education of my own, soon,” Martin said. “I’m graduating at the end of this semester. And then it’s off to the killing fields for me. Mandatory service.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t go for a higher degree? If you’re doing research--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin laughed. “Classics is not a subject that excuses people from duty to the fatherland. It’s not useful. If I were a doctor, or an engineer-- but I’m not.” He ran tucked his long hair again. “I suppose I should be grateful that I was able to eke out four years where I didn’t have to consider how to be of use to the fatherland.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mandatory service is only two years,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two years, if you survive,” Martin said. “And if I put on Achilles’s armor, I’ll die as Patroclus did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t say that,” Sybil said, quite alarmed by Martin’s fatalism.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin smiled at her and leaned back in his seat. “No, you’re right. I won’t resign myself to it.” He looked up at the ceiling. “And I suppose I’m trying to make my mark on the universe here, now, so that-- if the worst does happen-- there will be something of me left.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I ask…” Sybil began.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What we do here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’re willing to tell me. It can’t all be student newspapers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom didn’t tell all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am capable of discretion,” Tom said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” Martin studied Sybil. “Tom seems to trust you. He knows you better than I do, anyway.” He looked away. “I’m not going to be in charge of this place much longer. But Tom won’t be going anywhere. He’ll have to be responsible for bringing you into the fold.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand that you don’t trust me,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Martin said. “That’s not it. It’s not about you.” And he looked at Tom, with a look so searching that Sybil felt like she was intruding by sitting next to him. Tom just nodded, and the moment was over. Martin glanced at his watch. “I have class in twenty minutes. If I don’t start walking now I won’t get there in time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We could give you a lift,” Sybil offered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think so,” Martin said. He stood, causing Sybil and Tom to stand as well. He offered her his hand to shake. “It was a pleasure, Fraulein.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sybil,” she said. “If we are to be friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are we to be?” Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well then, Sybil. Until we meet again. Tom.” And he nodded curtly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see you later,” Tom said. “Sunday, maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll hold you to it.” He pulled his jacket down from a hook on the wall and headed for the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After Martin left, Tom introduced Sybil to a few other members of the group, the ones who had by now finished discussing their newspaper. He showed her how some of the printers worked, and some of the half-finished pamphlets that were getting ready to print. Sybil paid polite attention, but it was clear that without Martin, Tom felt somewhat lost, and she didn’t beg him to let her stay, or ask for more information than he was ready to divulge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They left after a little while, and when they got out to the car, Tom opened the passenger door for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Sybil got in, but before Tom closed the door, she said, “I suppose we’re back to what we were. Martin was right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin is right about a lot of things, m’lady,” Tom said. He had his hand on the door, but he wasn’t closing it yet. “Is there a different way you’d like it to be between us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You make it sound like there’s a different way it can be,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom nodded, and shut the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They drove in silence for a little ways. Sybil’s mind was turning over too much for her to suggest that Tom bring her to the shopping district so that she could look for a dress for Magdalena’s party. That seemed so distant now, like it belonged to a whole different world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you like Martin?” Tom asked after some time. “If you don’t mind me asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did,” Sybil said. “Though I don’t think he likes me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s just the way he is. You can’t pay him any mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seem to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom just shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to tell me what your club does?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Tom said. “But I want to be sure that you really want to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In truth, Sybil couldn’t have said herself if she did want to know everything that was going on. She suspected that it would be a heavy knowledge, one that would be hard for her to hold the weight of. But the weight of her uncertainty could have been worse. She hated the feeling of knowing that she was missing something important.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had been excited to come to Odin to be in the center of things, just a few weeks ago. She was approaching the center of something, that was sure. She only hoped she was chasing the right thing. She wished she could be as sure as Tom was.</span>

  <span>Although Thomas had promised the duke that he would be able to come into the capital to see him Sunday afternoon, he had agreed to that without considering that Carson would not like him to take off a random chunk of time, especially with rather little advance warning. But, of course, it wasn’t particularly difficult to lie to get what he wanted. So, one morning when Carson was striding through the servants’ hall in his usual gruff way, Thomas got his attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Carson, I was wondering if I could take Sunday afternoon and evening off,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson, who had been carrying a bottle of wine towards his office from the cellar, stopped in his tracks. “And why would you expect to do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just got a phone call from my doctor,” Thomas lied, and held up his hand. “He’s had a cancellation, and he wants to move up my regular checkup, since I said I was having trouble with the knuckles.” His voice lapsed into mumbles under Carson’s glare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would appreciate if you could learn that this house is not run according to your schedule, Thomas,” Carson said. “Although certain people act like it, you are not here as a charity case; you are here to perform your job. You cannot do that if you are not here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that ‘yes’ or ‘no’, Herr Carson?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go,” Carson said. “But I won’t let you make a habit of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas wondered after he left, if it wouldn’t have been better if Carson said no. Perhaps he would have handed in his notice then and there, and showed up to the duke’s hotel room ready to join his employ. But he knew he shouldn’t be so rash, so he just said, “Thank you, Herr Carson.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson shook his head and left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, on Sunday, Thomas dressed as nicely as he plausibly could for a trip to the doctor, and strolled out of the Grantham house, feeling about as good as he ever had. Even the chilly and rather long walk into town to catch the train into the capital didn’t bother him, and from there it was only a matter of keeping his anticipation in check to get to the hotel. He didn’t want to walk so fast that he arrived early or, worse, sweaty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he reached the hotel, the white marble facade was a chilly blue in the cloudy afternoon light, and Thomas strode up the steps to the lobby, looking as assured as he could. No one stopped him as he strolled inside. He doubted that the duke would appreciate him stopping at the reception desk and calling attention to himself, so he waited until the right moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He watched a woman trying to wrangle three well-dressed but misbehaving children into the elevator. When one child tossed his hat across the room, Thomas helpfully picked it up, and the woman was so grateful that she didn’t care that he ended up in the elevator with her, smiling as he punched the button for the top floor without swiping his room key card. She and her kids got off on the fourth floor, and Thomas continued up alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas knocked on the duke's door. There was a moment of silence, and then the door opened with a quiet click, revealing the duke. The moment his eyes settled on Thomas, his face lit in a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thomas," he said, in that funny, purring way of his, and held the door wide so that he could enter. Thomas did, his heart pounding, and the duke shut the door behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His hotel suite was beautiful, clean and light in a style that appeared distinctly foreign to Thomas's sensibilities, all sweeping lines and sparkling glass. He only had a moment to admire it, though, before the duke caught his sleeve and pulled him forward. Thomas didn't resist, and they ended up tumbling backwards onto the first piece of furniture in their path: a couch. Thomas sprawled across the duke's chest, his lower body hooked in place by the duke's left leg, while his right rested almost casually off the couch on the floor. Thomas couldn't imagine it was comfortable, but they were face to face, and the duke laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You seemed surprised to see me," Thomas said. "Did you think I wouldn't come?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In answer, the duke pulled Thomas forward, hand on the nape of his neck, and kissed him, as hungry as anyone had ever been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was not quite unexpected, and it certainly was not unpleasant, but it left very little room for conversation, with the duke’s hands traipsing along his back, slipping into every crack they could find in his clothing. Thomas wasn’t sure what to do with his own hands, as he was balanced on the couch much more precariously than the duke was. Though the duke seemed to be quite comfortable with Thomas’s weight atop him, in order to keep himself from falling off the couch, Thomas didn’t have as much freedom of movement. The duke seemed to enjoy that, too. Whenever Thomas tried to re-orient himself, or move down the duke’s body, the duke tugged on his hair to stop him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Thomas busied himself with kissing Philip, and things progressed in such a contented haze that Thomas hardly registered that the duke was stripping him of his clothing piece by piece, having pulled his jacket off him immediately, then tugged at his shirt patiently until all the loose buttons slipped free. When Philip pushed at him, Thomas moved, pliable, and his arms ended up out of his sleeves, ever so gradually. Eventually, the shirt lay discarded on the ground. He only came to his senses when, to get his undershirt off, the duke had to pull it off over his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me,” Thomas said, and tried to move. The duke allowed him to sit up, and he sat up as well, but as soon as Thomas reached for the duke’s shirt, the duke just pushed Thomas back. Thomas relented, though he felt strange doing so.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Later,” the duke said. “We’ll have time.” And he kissed the hollow of Thomas’s throat, his hands blindly undoing Thomas’s belt and shoving his pants down. When they caught on the shoes that Thomas had not yet removed, the duke used his own socked feet to pry them off, the whole time touching Thomas through his underwear, tracing lines on his stomach. Philip tucked his chin on Thomas’s shoulder, occasionally lifting it enough to tongue at his ear, or lowering it enough to nip his collarbone. Thomas wondered if Philip wanted him to beg, and he bit his lip, trying not to make any sound, trying to retain some modicum of control over himself as he stroked him through the fabric.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The half-touch, like how he held the duke’s neck with his gloved hand, was empty of everything except pressure, but that may have been for the best. Every one of his nerves was boiling beneath his skin, and all he could do was feel it, the duke not wanting him to move. Against his conscious effort, he let out a half-whine of breath and bucked his hips into the duke’s hand, which made Philip chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Thomas,” he said into his ear, and Thomas flushed and had to turn his face away, eyes closed. The duke pressed a kiss to his throat, where he was sure his heartbeat must have been visible for how wild the rush of blood in his head felt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He came quickly under the duke’s hand, and the underwear stopped him from making a mess of anything other than himself. He calmed his breathing, and the duke smiled languidly, traced his hand down Thomas’s chest once more for good measure, then stood from the couch and stretched, the picture of composure despite his disheveled hair and clothing. He appraised Thomas, lying undone on the couch, and his smile was pleased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With the duke no longer on top of him and instead picking him apart with his gaze, Thomas’s self-consciousness came roaring back, and he struggled to sit, grateful that he still had his underwear on, but feeling far too exposed. He looked up at the duke and struggled to find his voice, but Philip had looked away from him, to glance at his watch with a grimace, and he spoke before Thomas could think of anything to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take a shower,” he said. “There’s fresh clothes for you in the bathroom.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, it was to be like that. He wasn’t so naive as to think that the duke hadn’t planned all of this, taking off his clothes so that he would be more willing to wear something else. But the duke had been right: he wouldn’t protest. When he stood, the duke caught his waist before he could walk away. Thomas stopped, and their eyes met.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so happy you came,” the duke said. This line was delivered so sincerely, with such a gentle little smile and warm caress of his side, that Thomas felt dizzy. If the duke had asked him for anything in that moment, Thomas wasn’t sure he would have been able to refuse. But the duke just nudged him in the direction of the bathroom, and Thomas went.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the bathroom, as Philip had said, he found a box that he presumed contained clothes, but he didn’t look inside. As he showered, the water almost hotter than he could bear, he wondered what the duke was to have him wear. Lingerie? He wouldn’t mind that, he didn’t think. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soap in the shower was perfumed and made a rich lather, and when he stepped out, the towels were the softest he’d ever used. He tried not to think too hard about the luxury, because if he did, he may have begun to resent it, and he didn’t want himself to spoil the evening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he was dry, he finally opened the box. Inside, he found none of the lace or leather he might have been expecting, but a dinner suit, in a rather elegant and modern cut, along with cufflinks and socks and garters and all the rest. He wouldn’t mind going out to have dinner in the hotel’s restaurant in this, not at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas put the outfit on, and it fit surprisingly well. There was even a pair of shiny new black shoes with pointed toes. He laced them on, then contemplated himself in the mirror, slicking back his hair. The only thing that remained of his original outfit was the leather glove on his left hand, which Philip had not provided a replacement for.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wearing the outfit was like slipping into a new skin, with only his hand marking him as his original self. He smiled thinly at his reflection, then left the bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip had changed clothes while Thomas had showered, and Thomas was faintly disappointed that he hadn't had the chance to dress the duke: it would have been an excellent opportunity to prove his worth as a valet, among other things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, good, I’m glad you’re dressed,” Philip said when he turned away from his bedroom mirror to look at Thomas. “We’re going to have to hurry, or we’ll be unfashionably late.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have a dinner reservation?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I’ve been invited to dinner by Baroness Westpfale. She said she did not mind a Phezzani friend of mine joining me, so you’re coming. It will make the evening much more entertaining.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Entertaining?” Thomas asked, suddenly prickly. The clothes he was wearing were feeling more like a costume by the second. “I won’t be made a fool of.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you planning to make a fool of yourself?” Philip asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas frowned but said nothing. The duke smiled and traced his hand down Thomas’s chest, tugging ever so slightly at the cravate at his throat. Thomas’s further objections died in his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No one there will know you. And why should I lie about introducing a friend from Phezzan to the social scene on Odin? Be Thomas--” He broke off and laughed, suddenly, “I’m sorry-- I just realized I don’t have an inkling of your family name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Barrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you can be Thomas Barrow, heir to some magnate on Phezzan. Just for the evening. No one will know the difference. Gods know that Phezzan is stuffed to bursting with useless sons of men no one’s heard of who are richer than the Kaiser.” He chuckled. “That’s half the appeal of the place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m nothing like them,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Philip said, an appraising tone in his voice. His fingers played with the buttons on Thomas’s chest. “And that’s half your appeal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s the other half?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip’s mouth curled into a funny smile. “What do you think?” Teasing. He tapped Thomas’s chest, then dropped his hand. “I had my car brought around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should we leave together?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This hotel caters to Phezzanis,” Philip said. That made the foreign looking decor much more understandable. “They how how to be discreet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, although he was now feeling rather trepidacious, Thomas followed Philip out to a waiting car on the street. Philip slipped into the driver’s seat without hesitation, but immediately engaged the automatic steering when they pulled onto the busy city street. He kept his hands on the wheel, but they were slack, and it seemed mostly an excuse to have something to do with his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were mostly silent on the drive, but Thomas was curious enough to ask, “You didn’t bring your driver or valet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not planning on spending much time on Odin, so I like to give them plenty of chances to visit their families while I’m here,” Philip said, bored of the question. “I’m capable of living without an entourage, at least for a few days at a time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When are you planning to leave?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The end of the season, at the latest. I like to be the first to go, so that all the interesting people follow me out. I can’t bear Odin, honestly.” He looked out the window of the car. “It’s a miserable planet. If it wasn’t home, I would never come here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s better than where I come from,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Baroness Westpfale’s house rose out of the evening gloom, not too far out of the city limits. It was large and well kept, surrounded by gardens that would have been beautiful in the summer, or in the daylight. As it was, the whole scene had a brooding air, and the lit windows cut into the stone only added to the atmosphere.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were other cars parked in the drive when Philip parked them down at the end of the line. Though they were late to arrive, they weren’t that much later than the other guests: a few were still getting out of their cars and walking up to the building. Philip checked his reflection in the rearview before getting out, but Thomas’s attention was fixed on the car parked directly in front of them: he recognized the plate as belonging to the Granthams.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t go in there,” Thomas said, clenching his leather-gloved hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke looked over at him. “Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone from the Grantham family is in there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not Lady Mary,” the duke said, sounding completely nonchalant. “I made sure she wouldn’t be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s someone,” Thomas said. “I can’t--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really, Thomas?” the duke asked. The disappointment in his voice stung harder than anything else. He sighed and leaned back in his seat. “I swear that no one here would say a word, even if there is someone from the Grantham family here. It’s not that kind of party. Baroness Westpfale picks her guest list carefully.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But she lets you invite someone she doesn’t know?” Thomas asked. “That’s not careful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She trusts me.” He looked at Thomas, stared him down. “There’s nothing I can say to convince you? Nothing I could promise?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was something that he could promise that would make Thomas waltz in at his side, uncaring about the Grantham family. “If something did happen, you could promise to--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was at this moment that another car pulled in behind them. Philip turned in his seat to see who was getting out of the car. “Ah, Count Lohengramm is here after all,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas turned to look. Not only was Count Lohengramm stepping out of the passenger seat, but from the driver’s seat, Siegfried emerged, dressed exactly as nicely as the count was. They walked up to the house together, speaking softly enough that Thomas couldn’t hear their conversation, but he could see the happy light in the count’s eyes, and how he reached over to tug a curl of Siegfried’s blood-red hair, making him smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He suddenly understood much better what kind of party this was. The sight of Siegfried had fortified him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If the Granthams fire me, you’d make sure I--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll come?” Philip asked, smiling. “No one will say a word.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Thomas said, though his heart was in his throat. The pleased look on Philip’s face was enough to make him agree, even though he still had the sinking feeling that he was walking into a viper’s den.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excellent.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked up to the house together, though they didn’t walk shoulder to shoulder as Siegfried and Count Lohengramm had. The duke perhaps wanted to keep some semblance of distance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A footman let them into the house, and led them through to the library, which was already full of people standing about and talking. Thomas scoured the room for which member of the Grantham family he was going to be faced with. His eyes landed on Lady Sybil and, next to her, Matthew Crawley, who looked distinctly uncomfortable as a woman Thomas didn’t know leaned towards him with a wide grin on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The baroness’ butler announced them at the door. “The Duke of Crowsburg, and Herr Barrow of Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Various party guests turned to look at Thomas and the duke, and though most eyes settled on Philip as a man of status, Lady Sybil looked directly at Thomas, and her mouth opened in a silent ‘o’ of surprise. It was Siegfried who came to Thomas’s rescue, once again, stopped him from standing quite so frozen. Siegfried saw Thomas’s deer-in-the-headlights look, gave him a smile, and then gestured for Count Lohengramm to go over to talk to Lady Sybil, distracting her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was distracted, too, because he didn’t see the woman who had been antagonizing Matthew Crawley move until she came over to speak to the duke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Philip!” she said with a smile, and grabbed his arms in order to enthusiastically kiss both his cheeks. She was dark haired and young, though maybe a few years older than Thomas. She wore a vivid blue dress, an electrifying color that illuminated her eyes. “I knew you couldn’t keep yourself away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If there’s one thing that can be said about you, Maggie, it’s that you know how to keep a man entertained.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed, a tinkling, practiced sound. “Flatterer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who is your friend?” she asked, turning to Thomas. She smiled at him, and suddenly Matthew’s reaction to her made sense: her gaze was positively predatory. Thomas didn’t flinch: she didn’t know him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness Westpfale, this is Herr Thomas Barrow. He’s the friend from Phezzan I mentioned.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have so many friends from Phezzan, it’s impossible to keep track. You are a handsome devil, though,” she said to Thomas. “And I’m very happy to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Charmed,” Thomas managed to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The baroness laughed again. “Have you ever been to Odin before?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Thomas said, very truthfully, “this is my first time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” she said. “I hope that my humble little entertainments convince you that life on Odin is worth living.” She didn’t seem humble at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You haven’t managed to convince Philip of that,” Thomas said, and the baroness’s smile only grew wider. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, and it’s a shame. I keep saying, life is entertaining on Odin when all the entertaining people are around. If they’re all rushing to leave as soon as they can, it leaves the rest of us in a rather dreary state.” She nudged Philip’s arm. “But we make do when you’re gone, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure I contribute very little to the atmosphere, in the grand scheme of things,” Philip said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You, and everybody else who has your exact outlook,” she said, annoyed. “It’s like every drop in the ocean evaporates at once at the end of the season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If all you’re going to do is whine about how I should live my life, I think I shall go talk to Count Lohengramm instead,” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The baroness laughed. “Then I’ll go talk to Peter, who I am sure you are planning to avoid.” She gave the duke one last touch on his arm, and flitted away across the room to chat with a different circle of young men and women, sitting or standing around one of the couches.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Peter?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Marquess of Hexham,” the duke said, and nothing else. He began walking towards the small group that included Count Lohengramm, Siegfried, Lady Sybil, and Matthew Crawley. Thomas absolutely did not want to follow, but he had little choice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a startled moment of recognition in the count’s eyes when he looked at Thomas, but Siegfried’s calm smile seemed to stop him from saying anything, and the moment was gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Lohengramm, I’m so pleased that Maggie was able to drag you out into proper society,” the duke said. “I’ve been looking forward to seeing you again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Baroness Westpfale is known for having her way,” Count Lohengramm said dryly. “Though I would have seen you again at the hunt later this month.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke turned to Sybil and Matthew. “And, of course, a pleasure to see you both again, as well. I must say, I did not expect to encounter you here.” He nodded at Matthew.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father wouldn’t let me come without a chaperone,” Sybil supplied. “I’m afraid I rather forced Matthew’s hand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke smiled. “I should make various introductions. This is a friend of mine from Phezzan, Thomas Barrow. This is Count Reinhard von Lohengramm; Matthew von Crawley, the heir to the Grantham estate; Lady Sybil von Crawley, the Count of Grantham’s youngest daughter; and…” He turned to Siegfried, his brow furrowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Siegfried Kircheis,” Siegfried supplied. “I work for Count Lohengramm.” He must have been borrowing the name of one of the count’s real staff. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pleasure,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it that you do on Phezzan, Herr Barrow?” Count Lohengramm asked. It was a pointed question, but there wasn’t any malice in it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very little, I’m afraid,” Thomas said. Now that he was here, he had to act the part. The words came out without much trouble. “I’ve come to Odin to see if I can’t make something of myself.” Best to keep the lie as close to the truth as possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An admirable goal,” Siegfried said. “Lady Sybil was just talking about her own plans to get an education.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas looked at her, and she must have caught the quiet pleading in his face, because she made a clear decision to play along. Even if it was just for the sake of preventing a scene in front of Count Lohengramm, Thomas still appreciated her deft smile. “I doubt my father would approve,” she said. “But I think I would like to go to Odin National University. It’s hard to do much in life without an education.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t agree more,” Matthew said. “Did you attend university?” he asked Philip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On Phezzan,” Philip said. “I studied business.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew nodded and looked at Count Lohengramm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kircheis and I attended a military academy,” Count Lohengramm said. “It was enough of an education to learn what I needed to know about being in the fleet, but little more than that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciated my time there,” Siegfried said. “In a different life, I wouldn’t have minded studying something other than war, but I am grateful to the education I received nonetheless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could always go back to school when you retire from the fleet,” Matthew said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried smiled. “I’m not planning to leave the fleet any time soon. But perhaps.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There comes a time in a person’s life when they can learn more outside of school than they can in it,” Count Lohengramm said. “I’m sure Kircheis and I are already at that point.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t doubt it,” Matthew said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although they would have probably kept talking, their conversation was interrupted by the signal to go in to dinner. It felt exceedingly strange for Thomas to sit down at this meal, when he had spent so much of his life being one of the footmen who stood around the table, dishes in hand. He at least knew how to behave, from so many years of observing his employers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas ended up between the duke and a young woman on his left side, who ignored him completely to speak with the woman on her other side. The duke was fairly close to the head of the table, and Thomas was perfectly poised to listen to the conversations around him, passing between the various people he knew or had been introduced to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, Sybil,” Baroness Westpfale said over the soup, an evil trill in her voice, “you must tell me all about your mystery gentleman.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew Crawley’s eyebrows shot up, but he didn’t say anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have a mystery gentleman,” Sybil protested. “It’s not like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not?” the baroness asked. “When you told me about him, you told me all about how you were pretending to suddenly be obsessed with shopping in order to go on long walks through the city with him and meet all his friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I described it like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, feel free to clarify!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s just a friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A friend whose name you refuse to say, or how you met him, or who his family is, or any of the details that you would think your friends who care about you would want to know.” The baroness’s lips curled. “Sybil, darling, it must be </span>
  <em>
    <span>truly</span>
  </em>
  <span> scandalous if you won’t even tell </span>
  <em>
    <span>us</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” And she looked around the whole table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil followed the baroness’s gaze, and when her eyes met Thomas’s, it was her turn to have a frozen moment of uncertainty. Thomas silently thanked the gods for the baroness’s pot-stirring, giving him a measure of security. Ammunition. Thomas gave her an almost imperceptible nod, and she relaxed and smiled at the baroness again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s nothing,” Sybil said. “He’s just someone I know. And he only introduced me to his friends because I wanted to know people at ONU.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s a student, then?” Magdalena asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t say that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s not a student.” Her eyebrows raised. “A professor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Matthew’s turn to look concerned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! Gods. He’s just a friend, and my parents wouldn’t like me to be friends with him. That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like they don’t like you to be friends with me?” the baroness asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil shook her head and looked down into her soup.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he handsome, at least?” Sybil flushed, which made the baroness laugh. She touched Sybil’s arm. “Alright, I’ll leave you alone. But I do want to know. I’m a curious creature, to my detriment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Across from Thomas, Count Lohengramm spoke up, rescuing Sybil and the conversation. “I hear you went to visit my sister yesterday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how did you hear that, I wonder?” the baroness asked. “It’s true, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is she well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As ever,” Magdalena said. There was some evasiveness in her tone, and the count stared her down. “She asked me about your house.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My house?” The flatness in the count’s voice verged on disgusted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” The baroness twirled her hair. “The Kaiser would like to know when you are going to take up residence in the estate that he has granted you. It looks quite ungrateful if you refuse to use it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate the Kaiser’s generosity,” Reinhard said. “But I have more important things to do than worry about moving house.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure,” the baroness said. “Sadly, most of the court is going to care more about you living in a hovel than they do about any victory you have at Astarte.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was offended on the count’s behalf; though his rented rooms were small and strange, they were quite nice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are you living?” the duke asked, suddenly curious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not a hovel,” Siegfried said. “Lord Reinhard has been renting a flat outside the capital for several years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you, with him,” the baroness pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried just smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not very circumspect, you must admit,” the baroness said to the table at large. “But everyone ignores my prudent and worthwhile advice about how to behave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure I would ever describe your advice like that,” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think if I started giving imprudent advice, people would listen to me more?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What imprudent advice would you give me?” Count Lohengramm asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darling, if you’re going to live in a way that makes people talk, you should at least give them something interesting to talk about!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That did make Count Lohengramm laugh, and it was a sparkling sound to match the baroness’s. As soon as it ended, Thomas found himself wanting to hear it again, but Siegfried caught his eye across the table, and Thomas had the sudden sensation that the two of them were a world unto themselves, and that he, looking in on them, knew nothing about who they were, nothing at all. It was a strange feeling, and Thomas glanced at the duke, who had an equally strange expression on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, Siegfried’s glance at Thomas drew the baroness’s attention. “Herr Barrow,” she said, “I’m delighted that you could join us tonight. I hope you don’t have too busy a schedule while you’re visiting Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fairly busy,” Thomas said, trying to stay cool under the unexpected address. “But I can make time when I need to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a quality I appreciate in a man,” the baroness said, with a gleam in her eye. “I’m curious: how did you meet Philip on Phezzan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, just at some party,” Philip said. “I hardly remember. I was quite drunk, I believe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father is well off on Phezzan, Philip mentioned?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What from?” she asked. “I suppose it’s crass to speak of such things at dinner, but it’s always so curious to me that Phezzanis have something that makes them money, rather than simply having money.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas floundered for a second, the image of his father in the dark back rooms of his shop completely at odds with the image that the baroness-- and everyone else-- needed him to paint. The lie that came to him first was the one he went with. “Chronometers,” Thomas said. “He designed an improvement for chronometers on merchant ships. It helps with their navigation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.” This seemed to be the one thing that stopped the baroness in her tracks. Thank goodness that she had no interest in technical detail, because Thomas wouldn’t have been able to provide any. He saw Count Lohengramm open his mouth, but Siegfried must have given him some sort of signal under the table, because he shut it immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The baroness let the talk around the table slide down into less fraught subjects for the rest of the meal. Though the food was assuredly delicious, Thomas could barely taste it. He was so focused on the conversation, and not letting himself slip in his strange persona and ruin the game.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After dinner, the whole assembly went through into a hall, in which the furniture had been rearranged to facilitate drinking and dancing. Music was playing from some cleverly hidden speakers, though there was a piano in the corner that no one was touching. It seemed that most of the guests preferred to loiter by the sides of the room rather than dance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip stood next to Thomas by a window, both of them with glasses of wine in their hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are you enjoying Maggie’s party?” Philip asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never been to a stranger one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip laughed. “She’d take that as a compliment, if you said it to her. But are you glad I convinced you to come?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas looked at Sybil across the room. Baroness Westpfale had wrapped her arm around Sybil’s waist and was holding her tight to her side as they had a conversation with Matthew. “I’m sure I’ll find that out, soon enough,” Thomas said. “If something does happen--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Later,” Philip said. But his hand brushed the small of Thomas’s back, and Thomas shivered, and his misgivings left his mind with the ghost of a touch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They watched the other party guests mill around, and then the baroness abandoned Sybil and swooped down on Philip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dance with me,” she demanded of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Must I?” Philip asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is nothing worse in this world than a party at which no one dances,” she said, and her tone brooked no disagreement. Philip put his wine down on a nearby table and relented, stepping out into the center of the floor with her, to sway to the music. Thomas could just barely hear their conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you still planning to court Mary von Crawley?” the baroness asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am. Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I was just hoping you’d court me instead. We’d make a good team.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I doubt it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No? You wouldn’t even want a wife who’s capable of entertaining herself while you spend all your time on Phezzan without her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The problem with you, Maggie, is that your entertainments are usually designed to cause me trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would never.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You may not care what I do on Phezzan, but you would certainly start to care about how I manage my estate. That’s the kind of entertainment that troubles me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, how could you accuse me of such a thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t have a wife with a title of her own,” Philip said, and it was unclear how much of it was jest. “That’s the kind of thing that tends to give a woman bad ideas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The baroness laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas would have continued listening to their conversation, but Sybil came over to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie is forward enough to demand a dance, but I’m not sure I am,” Sybil said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you asking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose I am. Unless you don’t want to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although she was offering him an out, Thomas didn’t see an easy way to take it. It wasn’t like they hadn’t danced together before, at the servants’ ball, back home. That had been years ago, though, and the circumstances couldn’t have been more different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s been a long time since I’ve done this,” Thomas said, heading out onto the dance floor. There were more couples there, now that Magdalena had broken the ice, but most of them were treating the dancing with an irreverence that Thomas was unused to, trading partners every few steps, dancing what he supposed must be modern moves that he had just never seen before. Sybil took his hands in a much more formal way. They moved in silence for a few steps.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t ask what you’re doing here,” Sybil said. “I don’t think it’s my business to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate that,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lucky,” she said. “I almost got Edith to come with me, instead of Cousin Matthew.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lucky indeed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t tell my father about any of this?” Sybil asked. The incredulous look Thomas gave her in response was enough to make her look sheepish. “I know, a silly question.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How is Herr Crawley enjoying the party?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil looked over her shoulder. Matthew was talking amicably to a group of men that included Count Lohengramm and Siegfried. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He won’t say anything, either,” Sybil said. “Though I don’t think he recognized you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, he didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But even if he figures it out…” She shook her head. “He likes Maggie, and this is her party. He wouldn’t do anything that would upset her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if the baroness knew?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She would be entertained,” Sybil said. “But she’s not going to find out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas nodded. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to thank me,” Sybil said. She couldn’t quite meet his eyes. “You know, the other day, a friend of mine told me that I couldn’t even pretend not to be a lady. It’s baked into who I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas wasn’t sure where she was going, but she sounded confessional, so he just nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do a better job of pretending,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s all it is, m’lady. Just pretend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But it shouldn’t be.” She was distressed, in a way that Thomas didn’t understand. “There are people who understand that we’re all the same, just people. There can’t be so much difference between us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was silent for a second, thinking of how to respond. “I know who I am, m’lady. And when we leave here, I’m not going to pretend any different. I won’t have the chance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded. “I wish…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The song ended. Sybil offered Thomas a smile, and he nodded and dropped her hands. “I hope you are enjoying the party.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I am, really,” she said. “I should make sure Cousin Matthew doesn’t feel like I’ve abandoned him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was happy to let her go, and he sidled back over to the side of the party. Philip abandoned whatever conversation and sidled back over to Thomas. “I did say that there wouldn’t be any problem, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You say that now,” Thomas said. “You’re more trusting of this lot than I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps because they are my lot,” Philip said. “I know how they operate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was the core of it, wasn’t it?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you trust me, don’t you, Thomas?” Philip asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas found himself nodding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their attention was captured by a drama that was beginning to unfold across the room. The baroness had, at some point, demanded that Siegfried dance with her, and they were, traipsing across the dance floor at a speed she had set. This left Count Lohengramm positively seething on the sidelines, his champagne glass clutched in a white-knuckled hand, his frown visible from space.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Maggie has one skill, it’s making everyone dance to her tune,” Philip said with a dry chuckle. “He’s been friends with her for long enough that he should know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They continued to watch the baroness and Siegfried dance, and Count Lohengramm scowl. When the song ended, it appeared that the baroness had no intention of releasing Siegfried from her clutches, but Count Lohengramm stalked over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas and Philip were too far away to hear what words were exchanged between them, but the conversation ended with Magdalena laughing, throwing her head back, and letting go of Siegfried. The music struck up again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The world had narrowed to a single point, there in the center of the room. Siegfried and Count Lohengramm were dancing. The count’s golden hair flashed in the light, and he had his hand tenderly on Siegfried’s waist. They moved like one being, perfectly responsive to each other’s movements. They turned and stepped lightly, looking only at each other and ignoring the rest of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was bitterly jealous. He stepped closer to Philip, who was also watching the pair dance. Philip’s hand searched blindly in the air at his side, and then his fingertips came to rest on the back of Thomas’s right hand. A fluttering, almost invisible touch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re living in a different world from the rest of us,” Philip said after a moment. “Good luck to them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That answered a question that Thomas hadn’t been able to bring himself to ask. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Across the room, he spotted the baroness with her phone out, taking a photograph of the dancing couple. Nobody else seemed to notice her doing this, least of all Siegfried or Count Lohengramm. They trusted her too much, all of them did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the song ended, Siegfried whispered something into the count’s ear, and Count Lohengramm emerged from whatever daze he had been in. He smiled at Siegfried, then let go of him and walked off the dance floor, tossing his hair in the baroness’s general direction as he did. Siegfried made a bee line for the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be right back,” Thomas said to Philip, who nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas followed Siegfried out. He was only headed to the bathroom, it seemed. Thomas saw him head in, and waited outside in the dark hallway for him to emerge. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas got his attention when he came out, leaning against the opposite wall. “Siegfried,” he said quietly, not wanting his voice to travel too far.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enjoying the party, Thomas?” Siegfried asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I came to warn you--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Warn me?” Siegfried asked. His voice was light and calm, as it usually was, but he looked at Thomas with a new intensity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness Westpfale photographed you and the count,” he said. “Don’t let her blackmail you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried sighed. “Maggie…” He shook his head. “I’m sure it’s not blackmail. She might have a reason, but I’m sure it’s not that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You trust too much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for the warning,” he said. “I appreciate it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas nodded, and followed Siegfried back into the party. He immediately went over to the baroness, tapping her shoulder and pulling her away from the conversation she was engrossed in. Thomas stood just behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie, your phone, if you would.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sieg!” she said, affronted. “What do you want my phone for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am sure you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She scowled. “You’re a spoilsport. I was only going to show Annerose that her brother is capable of enjoying himself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Siegfried held out his hand, and she dropped her phone into it. Thomas looked over his shoulder as Siegfried swiped through Magdalena’s photos, then systematically deleted all of the pictures of himself dancing with Count Lohengramm. One of the photos he swiped past made Thomas freeze. There was a picture of himself, standing next to Philip, watching the couple dance. Philip was touching Thomas’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I have that photo?” Thomas asked, suddenly. “It’s a good one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, darling,” Magdalena said. “Give me your number, and I’ll send it to you.”</span>

  <span>When Thomas and Philip returned from the party, they stumbled through the hotel suite in the dark, not bothering to turn the lights on as they went. Philip was familiar with the layout of the furniture, and Thomas trusted his guiding hand on his sleeve, so neither of them tripped en route to the bedroom. Inside, Philip finally found the lightswitch, and then he tossed himself onto the bed, sprawling backwards with his hands out. Thomas wasn’t sure what to do with himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you enjoy the party, Thomas?” he asked, looking up at the geometric patterns in the molding on the ceiling, a funny smile on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas didn’t have the slightest idea how to answer that question truthfully, so he gave Philip the answer that he would want to hear. “Yes,” he said. “Did you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip waved his hand in the air. “There was better company than usual.” He chuckled, then sat up. “Can you stay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For a little longer,” Thomas said. He would have to be back at the Grantham estate early in the morning, and he would like to get some sleep, but at this hour he would already be sneaking back inside the house, so the precise time at which he did that hardly mattered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip smiled. “Good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas finally made up his mind to move, and he knelt down at the duke’s feet to remove his shoes, slipping his hand up the duke’s leg as he did so. Philip made a contented hum and twirled a lazy finger through Thomas’s hair. Although this made it quite hard to think straight, Thomas still had questions sitting in his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t think Lady Sybil will say anything to Lady Mary, do you?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was brought up short by this question. “She has as many reasons to talk as she does to keep quiet.” He didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>think</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sybil would say anything, at least regarding him, but she might make a nudge to Mary that the duke would be a poor husband.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel like I have been quite clear about the type of wife I’m looking for, and Lady Mary seems to have no objections to that.” He shrugged. Thomas had gotten his shoes off by now, but didn’t feel like unhooking his socks from their garters, so he just set them neatly by the side of the bed, then sat next to the duke in order to pull off his jacket. “Lady Sybil looks as though she has an independent streak. If Lady Mary is similar, she would appreciate me as a husband.” He chuckled. “She knows I spend most of my time on Phezzan, anyway, and she certainly understands that her mother’s Phezzani fortune is what makes her appealing to most.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you think there won’t be a problem.” Thomas took the duke’s hands in his so that he could remove his cufflinks. The duke was yielding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you say so?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You ought to take me with you, when you marry her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take you with me? As what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A valet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>have</span>
  </em>
  <span> a valet, Thomas,” Philip said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One who’s attached to his family on Odin,” Thomas pointed out. “I wouldn’t mind living on Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s different there,” Philip said. He shook his head. “The rules are different.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” Thomas lifted the duke’s hand to his mouth, kissed his fingers. The duke stroked his lips with his thumb.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if this whole thing with Lady Mary is guaranteed to come off,” the duke pointed out. “It’s early yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if it doesn’t,” Thomas mumbled around the duke’s hand, “you should take me on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not quite that simple.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is for Count Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip was silent for a moment. “I expect Count Lohengramm will end up as a very beautiful corpse before he’s thirty, so I can’t blame him for living his life in such an incautious way. I’m sure he knows it won’t make any difference to him in the end, which is why he does it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you say that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As soon as the Kaiser dies--” Philip’s voice was unexpectedly melancholy. “Well, I don’t expect you to care about court politics. I’m sure it doesn’t matter to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It matters to you.” He reached for the duke’s shirt, slowly undoing the buttons. Philip tilted his head to the ceiling again, exposing his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve had thirty years of calm with Friedrich,” he said. “That isn’t going to last-- anyone can see how fragile he is these days. I need to get married to someone whose money is already on Phezzan, so that I can ride out the storm there, no matter what happens here.” He shook his head. “Lohengramm has made enemies of Braunschweig and Littenheim, and he’s not willing to run away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He thinks he’s going to change the universe,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who told you that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His man. Siegfried.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke nodded. “Best of luck to him, then.” It was an echo of what Thomas himself had said to Siegfried. Neither of them really believed it, no matter how much they wanted to. It pleased Thomas, in some way, to know that he and Philip were similar: practical.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you take me with you?” Thomas asked. “It’s not like I want to get caught in the middle of a civil war either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t tell the future, Thomas,” Philip said. He cupped the side of Thomas’s face. “If things turn out...” He trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was the best that Thomas would get right now, he was sure. It would have to be enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thomas walked back to the Grantham house in the dark, his phone flashlight the only illumination once he left the town’s streetlights and got onto the long, winding road that led to the estate. It was cold, now, and he was exhausted, but he trooped onwards. Though he heard owls hooting in the trees a few times as he walked, he didn’t see them, or any other animals either. It was a relief to finally see the lights of the Grantham house peeking through the trees, and he quickened his pace, veering off the main road to cut across the grass to the servants’ entrance in the back. The lights were all on in the garage as he passed, though the door was shut, so Thomas couldn’t see who was inside or what they were doing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His shoes were wet with dew when he pulled around the side of the house, and he was shivering. He was in such a hurry to get inside that he didn’t notice the man standing near the door, looking up at the sky, until it was too late to change course. When the man turned, hearing Thomas’s footsteps crunch across the gravel, Thomas recognized it was Bates. He was wearing a jacket and shoes, but his pyjama pants were visible, and it looked like he wasn’t wearing socks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was wondering when you’d get back from your sortie,” Bates said. His tone was unusually gruff, even for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s it matter to you?” Thomas asked. He wanted to edge past Bates to get indoors, but that seemed like it would be difficult.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Carson doesn’t appreciate being lied to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who says anything about lying?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No one comes back from an afternoon doctor’s appointment at three in the morning,” Bates said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it your business where I go during my time off, Herr Bates?” Thomas asked. He discovered that he was still riding the high of the time he had spent with the duke, and this elevated his tone to something approaching superiority. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bates took a step towards Thomas. The light above the door scrambled his features into harsh shadows and white planes, menacing in the gloom. His breath rose in a cloud. “The reputation of Lord Grantham is my business, and, by extension, the reputation of this house. For his staff to be out damaging that reputation--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What damage have I done?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know exactly what you’re doing,” Bates spat. “I know your kind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My kind?” Thomas straightened. “If you’re going to accuse me of something, say it. If you can’t make an accusation without proof--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bates took another step forward. He was close enough that Thomas could smell his breath. Minty. He had just brushed his teeth. Thomas would have felt more comfortable if it had been beer that he smelled, but Bates was dead sober. That made him more dangerous, and more likely to remember anything Thomas said. “The proof is in you sneaking back here at this time of night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t sneaking, Herr Bates. I walked right up here, and I would have gone right in to bed if you hadn’t stopped me.” He paused, stared him down. “I haven’t done anything wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would Herr Carson agree?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could accuse you of something, Herr Bates. You’re out here at night doing--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This apparently touched some sort of nerve for Bates. He shoved Thomas back against the wall of the house, the rough stone scraping Thomas’s back through his jacket. Bates grabbed the front of his shirt and held him by it, breathing heavily. Thomas was loose and floppy under the shove, but he stared Bates down, even as Bates hissed, “You shouldn’t talk so much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to hit me, Herr Bates?” Thomas asked. The cheek was going to get him hurt, he knew it, but he couldn’t help it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You reek of cologne,” Bates said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas opened his mouth to say something in response, but before he could, there were footsteps crunching on the gravel, coming from the garage, and Tom appeared in silhouette in the foggy light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s going on here?” he demanded, looking at Bates, who scowled and let Thomas go. He slid down the wall when he was released.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing you need to concern yourself with,” Bates said, and then, to avoid any further questions from Tom, turned and went inside the house, the door shutting hard behind him. Thomas took a second to calm his breathing, then straightened and dusted himself off vainly. Tom looked at him in mild concern.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was that about?” Tom asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas almost said something rude, but Tom had never done him ill (in fact, in all the time that Thomas had been working at the Grantham house, they had barely spoken, since Tom spent most of his time in the garage), so he composed himself. “You ought to be careful about him,” Thomas said, nodding behind himself to where Bates had disappeared. “He’s taken it upon himself to have a special interest in where all of us staff go during our off time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even in the dim light, Tom’s sudden anxiety was visible. “And why would I need to be careful about that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not a very good liar,” Thomas pointed out. “I saw you in the city, earlier. The day I borrowed the car. You went into some unmarked building on 42</span>
  <span>nd</span>
  <span> Street. And you must have been there until late, since I didn’t see you until the next morning. I was looking for you to give the car keys back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom looked nervous. “Thank you for not mentioning that to anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas just inclined his head. “I am awfully curious about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not worth your curiosity,” he said. Although he tried to sound nonchalant, he was on the back foot still, and Thomas could pick out the half lie. “It’s just a group of friends that I was going to see. We talk about politics, mostly. It’s nothing special.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if you don’t want Bates to know about it, you’d better be careful about coming and going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t ask where you came from.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A doctor’s appointment,” Thomas said, as bland of a tone in his voice as possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom cracked a smile at that. “What was he doing out here, anyway?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No idea. Wouldn’t ask him unless you want his hand on your throat, though,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lucky I was here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not afraid of him,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Afraid’s one thing. Bruised is another.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wouldn’t have hit me. Carson wouldn’t have it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he believed you when you told him. Your word against Bates’s.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why’s his word any better than mine?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s been in the house longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That made Thomas scowl. “That’s not any good reason. It’s not like he and I are any different.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it doesn’t matter,” Tom said. “It’s better that you don’t have to get Carson involved. And Bates won’t, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you doing out here, anyway?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, just reading,” Tom said, and this time his voice had the ring of truth in it. “I’ve gotten words when people see me up late in my own room, so I go out to the garage for some peace. But I keep the back windows open, to vent all the fumes, and I could hear you talking. Surprised you didn’t wake up the whole house.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Must be nice, to have your own little dominion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Tom said. “Someday, I’d love to run a garage of my own, not just work for a family like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good luck to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom laughed. “I know. I’m never going to get the cash for that kind of thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas shivered. Now that the excitement was over, he was freezing in the night air. Tom had his sleeves rolled up to the elbow, and goosebumps covered his arms. “We shouldn’t stand out here, unless we’re inclined to freeze.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Tom said. “I’d better lock up the garage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas trooped inside as Tom jogged away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he reached his bedroom, Thomas quickly went through his evening routine and lay down in bed. Despite how tired he was, he found it difficult to fall asleep, with all the events in the day still rushing through his head. It hardly felt real at all, any of it. It was like he had been in a dream all day. Wanting something to confirm that it all had happened, Thomas took out his phone and looked at the picture that Baroness Wesptfale had sent him. There he was, standing next to Philip, Philip’s fingers just brushing his, ever so deliberately. Thomas studied it, a strange and warm feeling in his heart, until finally his eyes grew too heavy to keep open, and he fell into a deep sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Although the information that Thomas had learned about Tom was interesting, he didn’t have much to do with it, not unless he wanted to go visit Tom’s little hideout, or do any poking around in the garage. Both of those things sounded like plausible leads, but Thomas doubted they would give him much that he could actually use, and they would likely only get him into trouble. So, he left Tom and all his strange business alone for a few days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One morning the next week, Thomas was serving breakfast. Things were the usual early-morning quiet, with only Count Grantham and Lady Sybil at the table, Ladies Mary and Edith not bothering to get up until later. Sybil had smiled at Thomas on her way in, and her voice was its usual bright and cheerful self as she spoke to her father, who was half-ignoring her to read the paper as he ate his eggs and toast. He was frowning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is something the matter, Papa?” Sybil asked, mostly it seemed just to make conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Reading the capital news ever morning truly only makes me want to go back home,” Lord Grantham said. “Remind me when the season is going to be over, again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In about two months,” Sybil said. “It can’t be that bad. What’s the gossip that’s made its way into print?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not gossip.” He flipped the paper down to show Sybil the stark black and white photograph on the page he was looking at. Thomas looked at it as best he could from his vantage point back near the food. He was startled to see a sight that he was intimately familiar with: the destroyed hulk of an Imperial military transport ship, its aft engines a smoking wreck. This one was only different from the hundreds he had seen during his service because it was on the ground, and the charred debris had fallen rather than forming a cloud, a kind of funeral shroud for the dead ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” Sybil asked, concern in her voice. “Is the crew alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Terrorism,” Lord Grantham said. “Which is the last thing this country needs.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Terrorism?” Sybil blanched. “How do they know it wasn’t a malfunction?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas could have told her right out that ships didn’t malfunction like that, but he kept his mouth shut and just listened to what Lord Grantham had to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That ship was supposed to take a load of criminals off-planet,” he said. “They escaped in the chaos before they could be loaded onboard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gods,” Sybil said, face pale.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s bad enough that the line of succession isn’t clear,” Lord Grantham said. “I suppose everyone has decided that this is their chance to take advantage.” He angrily shuffled the paper. “I will have to convince your mother to stay home next season, or at least until things blow over.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Papa!” Sybil protested. “I don’t think it’s that bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Today it’s prison ships, tomorrow it’s Duke Braunschweig’s manor,” Lord Grantham said. “You don’t know what these types of people are capable of, once they’ve tasted blood.” He shook his head. “My first priority is to keep you safe, and it looks from here that you will be safer at home than on Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you’re blowing this out of proportion,” Sybil said. “Odin is perfectly safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Privately, Thomas wasn’t sure that he was blowing it out of proportion. Philip’s anxiety about establishing a cash haven on Phezzan before the outbreak of civil war seemed perfectly reasonable, so Lord Grantham’s worries probably were as well. Though, if he had a choice, Thomas would much prefer to follow Philip to Phezzan than be dragged back out to the outer edge of the galaxy with the Grantham family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your mother will agree with me,” Lord Grantham said. “And I hope to convince your grandmother and your aunt of the same. They should come back home with us at the end of the season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what if Mary does get engaged? Will we leave her behind?” As Sybil asked that question, her eyes flicked to Thomas, who stood completely impassive. Lord Grantham didn’t seem to notice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In another year, I’d say that the Duke of Crowsburg spending most of his time away from his estate and on Phezzan was foolish, but this year, I don’t mind it. Mary would be safe there, along with the rest of your mother’s side of the family.” Lord Grantham studied the paper a moment more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil frowned and shook her head. “May I see that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham handed her the paper, and then he stood up. “I need to make some phone calls.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About this?” Sybil asked, shaking out the paper and peering at the photograph.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not exactly,” Lord Grantham said. “I’ll see you later, my darling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil nodded absently, still reading the story. When she finished, she glanced up at Thomas. “Thomas, have you seen Tom this morning?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t, but I expect he’s in the garage, m’lady. I haven’t heard any of the cars go out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you like me to fetch him for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no.” She folded the paper and tucked it under her arm as she stood. “I just am wondering if I shouldn’t spend more time in the city, if Papa is going to make us all miss next season.” She was lying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s good to enjoy things while you can, m’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled. “It is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was deathly curious about Sybil’s desire to find Tom, so he made sure to keep an eye out the window at the garage, waiting for her to go out and find him. This luckily didn’t happen until after Thomas was freed from his breakfast duties, having served Mary and Edith when they finally came downstairs to eat, snipping at each other the whole time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he spotted Sybil out the window beginning to stroll across the lawn, Thomas hastily ran down and out the servants’ entrance of the house, then took the long route behind the garage. He was fairly sure he wouldn’t be spotted, pressing his back against the back wall of the garage, where the dusty rear windows were perpetually cracked to stop fumes from building up inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had arrived a while after Sybil, so they had already gotten into whatever conversation they were planning to have.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I swear I don’t know who was responsible for it, m’lady,” Tom said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t know, but do you suspect?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t Martin. He would have told me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would he have? It doesn’t seem like the kind of thing that someone would go around just telling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin would trust me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil sighed. Thomas heard the crinkling of the newspaper. “Even if it wasn’t your friends--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think it was.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Regardless. It’s going to bring attention to anybody who looks like they might be involved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We look like a legitimate student publisher,” Tom said. “There wouldn’t be any reason for--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“From what you’ve told me about the world, it seems like you have a little too much faith in the police to only target legitimate suspects.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom was silent for a long second. “I’m sure Martin is already prepared for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you asking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a clear anxiety in Sybil’s voice. “What happens if that office gets raided, Tom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s nothing incriminating in there.” A pause. “There shouldn’t be anything connected to me in there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fingerprints? Martin’s surveillance footage of the door?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He erases that every night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you worried about me?” There was a teasing note in his voice. “I’m pleased by your concern, m’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes! I am worried!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll tell Martin to look out,” Tom said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence. “What would you do, if something did happen?” Tom asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Sybil asked. “To Martin and the rest?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To me,” Tom said. “If someone came to the door, here, and took me away-- what would you do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil didn’t answer for a long second. “Why would you ask me that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just curious, m’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sybil.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a slight shuffling noise, someone taking a few steps. “I don’t know,” Sybil finally said. Her voice was firmer now. “I hope nothing happens. That’s why you have to be careful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will, m’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.” Another sound of footsteps. “I’ll see you later, I’m sure.” The garage door rattled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas poked his head around the side of the garage, half obscured by bushes, and watched Sybil walk away, the newspaper clutched in her tight fist. She looked around furtively, but didn’t see him, and frowned as she made her way back to the house.</span>

  <span>Reinhard arrived at the Grantham estate with his key staff in tow. Since they were attending this hunt because they were fleet officers, Reinhard had decided it was plenty appropriate for them all to wear their uniforms, and Kircheis hadn’t protested. It saved him the trouble of dressing up, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Along with Kircheis, Reinhard had brought the two rear admirals under his command, Mittermeyer and Reuenthal, and his chief staff officer, Captain Mecklinger. Reuenthal was a tall man, slender, with dark hair and striking, mismatched eyes. He walked side by side with Mittermeyer, who was short and stocky with shaggy blond hair, cheerful where Reuenthal was somber. Mecklinger brought up the rear of the group, and was likely the least excited to be spending the day galloping through the woods. He had an average build, and his long hair and moustache would have been taken for aristocratic, except that his name lacked the necessary ‘von’. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were let into the house by a gangly footman, and they met Lord Grantham in the library, already dressed to hunt but waiting for everyone else to show up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Lohengramm, I’m so pleased that you could make it,” he said when Reinhard entered the room. “Or should I address you as Admiral, since you’ve come in uniform?” He looked at Reinhard and his staff in uniform with a naked longing in his eyes, one that Reinhard tried to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m grateful for the invitation,” Reinhard said, waving his hand at the question of the address. “I don’t have as many chances as I like to enjoy the natural beauty of Odin. I presume you haven’t had the opportunity to meet my staff?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I certainly have not. Spending much of my time off planet has rather cut me off from my old fleet contacts, I’m afraid. That’s something I’d like to mend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. This is Rear Admiral Oskar von Reuenthal and Rear Admiral Wolfgang Mittermeyer--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I believe I have heard your names,” Lord Grantham said, shaking hands with the two of them. “Duke Braunschweig had mentioned--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like to think that whole affair is behind me,” Mittermeyer said, with a smile that tightened on his face as he spoke, though he still shook Lord Grantham’s hand warmly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, of course,” Lord Grantham said. He seemed guileless, to Reinhard’s eyes, and smiled as he turned to Mecklinger and Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Captain Ernst Mecklinger, and Captain Siegfried Kircheis,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pleasure,” Lord Grantham said, shaking their hands. “I’m so glad you could all come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Most of us are on an extended posting to Odin, these few months, so coming is no trouble,” Reinhard said. “I expect to be going out sometime next month, but the rumor is it will just be my fleet, without the support of Reuenthal and Mittermeyer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham raised his eyebrows. “I’m surprised.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard smiled. “I am grateful for the opportunity to prove that His Majesty’s trust in me is not unfounded,” he said. “I rely on my staff, but if there is talk that I cannot perform without them, I would like to dispel it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Completely understandable,” Lord Grantham said. “I’m sure it will be a roaring success.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door opened behind them, and the three daughters of the family trooped into the room, accompanied by their mother. Reinhard nodded in greeting. All three of them smiled, but Reinhard only thought that the smile from the youngest, Sybil, was anything close to genuine. Edith’s was tinged with desperation, and Mary’s gaze roved across the assembly of Reinhard’s staff, settling on Reuenthal with a spark of interest. Reinhard ignored that. It was more trouble than it was worth to involve himself in Reuenthal’s personal matters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me introduce my wife and daughters,” Lord Grantham said, and made the requisite introductions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When all the names had been said, Edith asked, looking directly at Mary, “Is the Duke of Crowsburg coming?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He is,” Lord Grantham said. “I believe he will be here soon, along with Matthew.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excellent,” Mary said. “I’m so pleased.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girls were all dressed to go riding, but their mother was not. “You aren’t planning to hunt, Lady Grantham?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no,” she said. “I’m afraid I wasn’t brought up to enjoy it. You’ll have a more pleasant time without me there to slow you all down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s true that today seems like a gathering of youth,” Lord Grantham said. “But I like to think that I can keep up with the best of them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you a good shot?” Mittermeyer asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should hope,” Lord Grantham said. “I’m sure no one will mind if we go out and pick mounts and guns while we’re waiting for the rest of the guests to arrive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was likely for the best that they all headed out into the bracing fall air for the walk to the stable, because it forestalled any awkwardness of remaining in the library with nothing to do. Reinhard, though he had barely said a thing, was already feeling like agreeing to this invitation had been a mistake. Of course, it had been Kircheis who had agreed for him, and Reinhard couldn’t object after that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they walked, Sybil sidled up beside him. “Might I ride with you today, Count Lohengramm?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you like,” Reinhard said. “I wasn’t aware that I needed accompaniment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll likely split up, and it is best if you have someone who knows the estate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been perfectly capable of navigating in much harsher environments than this, Lady Sybil,” Reinhard said, and a trace of amusement crept into his voice despite himself. “Remember when we were on Kapche-Lanka?” he asked Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could hardly forget, Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said. “You are welcome to join us, Lady Sybil, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should ride with Cousin Matthew, then, I suppose,” Edith said, shooting an annoyed glance at Sybil as she did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Deciding for him before he even gets here?” Mary said, her tone lofty. “Suppose he would prefer to ride with someone else?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think it would be you?” Edith said back. Delivering retorts was an instinct, Reinhard supposed, because she flushed immediately after the words left her mouth, realizing that it served her poorly to be rude in the presence of guests she was supposed to impress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral von Reuenthal,” Mary said, ignoring Edith, “would you care to ride with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Certainly,” Reuenthal said. Mecklinger, who was silently watching all of these interactions, shook his head to himself. No one but Reinhard noticed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They made it to the stable, and were in the process of picking out mounts when Matthew von Crawley and the Duke of Crowsburg arrived together, led along by one of the footmen. Reinhard now recalled exactly why the duke’s escort at Magdalena’s party had seemed so similar: this was him. But he said nothing to anyone, though Kircheis caught his eye with a smile, and he simply went to stand over with the rest of the servants who would be trailing along with their ammunition and other equipment, staying well out of the way of the hunt itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew had a somewhat strange expression on his face, one that only grew stranger when Edith asked if she might join him on the hunt. He agreed, with a glance over at Mary, who was adeptly conversing with both the duke and Reuenthal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the end, Mittermeyer and Mecklinger ended up with Lord Grantham; Mary formed a party with the Duke of Crowsburg and Reuenthal; and Matthew suggested that he and Edith follow after the party comprised of Sybil, Reinhard, and Kircheis. Reinhard didn’t care, but Edith was somewhat perturbed, and Reinhard expected she would try to peel him off at some point to go their own way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A stiff wind was blowing by the time they set out, rattling through the dry-leafed trees. They headed into the wind, down the well-maintained but thin hunting trails that crisscrossed the estate. There was little talk at first, at least among their cohort. Reinhard slipped naturally into the intense, focused state that came whenever he had something to accomplish. The horse obeyed him without even a hint of recalcitrance, a tall white mare whose hooves kicked up leaves when Reinhard urged her to leap over fallen trees. Kircheis was silent beside him on a chestnut horse, looking around with keen eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil, on a lithe black horse, eventually grew tired of the oppressive quiet, and shimmied up next to Reinhard on the path. Kircheis pulled ahead to allow them some space, and Reinhard kept his eyes trained on his back the whole time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you like hunting, Count Lohengramm?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Reinhard said. “Do you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I enjoy riding. Shooting, less, I’m afraid.” She stroked her mount’s neck as she spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You and Kircheis have something in common, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m happy to hear it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I ask you a question?” Reinhard asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father, he is social with Duke Braunschweig?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes,” Sybil said. “I believe they went to school together. We usually have dinner at his estate at least once during the season, though he’s been busy this year, I’m told, so we haven’t gotten around to it yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m surprised your father continues to invite me around, then,” Reinhard said. “Duke Braunschweig and I have never seen eye to eye.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Papa doesn’t care about politics more than he cares about people,” Sybil said. “He likes you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For who I am?” Reinhard asked, voice very dry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil looked off into the woods. “Well, for the idea he has of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard nodded. “That’s a funny thing. It’s hard to know people for who they are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think you know me, Lady Sybil?” Reinhard asked. He looked directly at her, in her eyes, and whatever strange and menacing light she saw there made her turn away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was a silly thought,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard spared her, and changed the topic. “I suppose I care as little about politics as your father does, though I’m sure in a different way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie thinks you shouldn’t be so careless about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness Westpfale cares about politics far too much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I envy your ability to stay above it all,” Sybil said after a second. “I wish I could be the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard was silent for a long moment. “It’s not that I do not care, Lady Sybil,” he said. “But when you have something in your life that is important to you, you realize how little the opinions of everyone else matter. If you find something like that for yourself, the ability to not care will most certainly come along with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you’re right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course I’m right.” Reinhard laughed, and Sybil did, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From a little ways behind them, Edith called out, “I think the path is a little crowded with the five of us! Matthew and I are going to take the next branch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil turned her horse and trotted back to them. “You don’t have to go,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” Matthew said. “I’ll see you back at the house.” He was serious enough that Sybil nodded, but let him and Edith go to trot back towards Reinhard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want to talk to her about?” Edith asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing much,” Matthew said, and that was the last that Reinhard heard of their conversation before they vanished off into the trees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now truly alone with Reinhard and Kircheis, Sybil was much quieter, and she fell behind them as they moved through the forest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are we hunting a deer, Lord Reinhard?” Kircheis asked after a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would please Lord Grantham, and Baroness Westpfale,” Reinhard said. This was as neutral of a statement as he could muster. He wanted to hunt, but he would rather have Kircheis be happy. “We can’t be said not to put in an effort.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t tell on you,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard let out a dry laugh, but Kircheis just shook his head and pointed a little way off into the woods. There was a characteristic deer trail, with fresh prints sloshed out of a muddy depression in the ground. It was barely visible, but Kircheis had a keen eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should we dismount?” Reinhard asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil, would you mind staying with the horses?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. You go ahead,” she said. “I don’t want to slow you down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis, who had been somber this whole time, offered her a quick smile, and swung himself off his horse. He handed her the reins, then gathered up his rifle. Reinhard dismounted as well, landing on the forest floor with a quiet thump.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded at Sybil, then walked with Kircheis along the deer’s path. Kircheis, despite how tall he was, made so little noise that Reinhard wouldn’t have noticed he was there, except for his occasional checking to reassure himself that Kircheis remained by his side. Kircheis focused on the trail ahead, lifting his hand to direct Reinhard silently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, they spotted the deer. It hadn’t noticed them, as the wind was blowing in their favor, and Kircheis pointed out a place where the ground rose slightly, enough that they could lay behind it and not be seen. The red of Kircheis’s hair would blend in with the fallen leaves, at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They settled themselves down a ways apart, unable to see each other clearly, their rifles at the ready, laying in the slimy leaf-litter, and waited for the deer to move so that they could get a good shot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a buck, one of its antlers half festooned with leaves. Weak sunlight dappled its flank through the branches overhead, and it took a few careless steps between the trees, its head moving this way and that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both knew when the deer would come close enough to shoot. Reinhard lined up his shot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just a moment more, and the deer sauntered past the bush that was blocking his field of view, into a clearing that gave him a good angle. Reinhard squeezed his rifle’s trigger, but at the last instant nudged the gun so that the shot went wide. He could have hit the deer, but Kircheis wouldn’t want him to, and why spoil the afternoon?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound of the gunshot rang through the forest, and the deer leapt in surprise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But a second shot rang out to Reinhard’s left, and the deer stumbled and collapsed, thrashing, as the blood spilled from a wound low in its throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard stood, and Kircheis emerged from his hiding spot. “Good shot,” Reinhard said. There was a strange feeling in his chest looking at Kircheis, who went over to make sure that the deer was dead. His eyes were in shadow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Grantham will be pleased,” Kircheis said after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From behind them, they could hear hoofbeats approaching-- Lady Sybil following the gunshots. Reinhard and Kircheis said nothing until she appeared, and she looked down at the dead deer. “Congratulations, Count Lohengramm,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Reinhard said. Kircheis would not want the credit, he knew, so he had no qualms about taking it. “We should get someone to bring this back to the house, and then go back ourselves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can take our time riding back,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Reinhard said. “There’s no rush.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sun was well on its way down by the time that Reinhard, Kircheis, and Sybil returned to the house. The sky had filled with thick clouds, and the wind continued to blow. Behind the house, in a firepit, some of the house staff were burning branches and leaves that they had gathered from the pristine lawn, a roaring blaze that sent a hazy cloud of sweet-smelling smoke driven near-sideways towards the trees. Rather than go inside, it seemed as though everyone who had returned from the hunt stabled their horses and returned their guns and then stood around the fire, drinking thermoses of coffee that the servants brought out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mecklinger and Mittermeyer were spattered completely in mud, but Mittermeyer was cheerful anyway. Reinhard greeted them and asked how their hunt had gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, good,” Mittermeyer said. “We ended up chasing one into a bit of a bog.” He gestured down at himself. “Lord Grantham went inside to change. How was your hunt?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Successful,” Reinhard said, and left it at that. “Reuenthal’s not back yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer shrugged, though the tension in his shoulders was evident. “He enjoys riding. Probably won’t come back until after sunset.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard accepted a hot drink when he was offered one, and stood staring into the fire, the edge of the trees in his line of sight so that he could see when the rest of the hunters arrived. Matthew and Edith had returned already, and Matthew wandered over to Sybil. He spoke in low tones, across the fire, but Reinhard still could make out what he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was wondering if Lady Mary and her entourage would end up riding back with you,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Sybil replied. “I haven’t seen her. She probably won’t be out for too much longer.” She shivered, and warmed her hands over the fire. “It’s gotten too cold to want to be out and not stand by the fire.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edith, who had been speaking with Mecklinger a little ways away from the fire, noticed that Matthew and Sybil were talking, and came closer, enough that she could listen to the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s true,” Matthew said. He paused. “Sybil--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know it isn’t truly my business, but is Lady Mary serious about the Duke of Crowsburg?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edith couldn’t help but force herself into the conversation. “As serious as she ever is about anything, which is not very much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew frowned and fell silent. It was for the best that he did, because it was at that moment that Mary, Reuenthal, and the Duke of Crowsburg emerged from the trees, leading their tired horses over to the stable. They all looked to be in good moods, and they were sure to walk over to the fire as soon as their horses had been stabled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could try to let her live her life without worrying about it, Edith,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She shouldn’t treat it all like a game,” Edith said, watching the trio on horseback vanish into the stables. “Or, if she is going to treat it like one, she should remember that games are something she can lose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil walked away, deciding that she would rather talk to Mittermeyer, and Matthew followed her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How late are we staying, Kircheis?” Reinhard asked, turning to him as he stared into the fire. It matched his hair, and Reinhard lazily reached up to tug on one of his curls. Kircheis smiled at that, though it didn’t reach his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We didn’t agree to stay for dinner,” Kircheis said. “But you should at least say goodbye to Count Grantham when he comes back out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you say so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke, Mary, and Reuenthal left the stables. Reuenthal split off to go speak to Mittermeyer, but the duke and Mary came over to the fire.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m told you caught a deer, Count Lohengramm,” the duke said. “Congratulations.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard smiled. “Did you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, we didn’t manage to find any trail. I think we rather disappointed Herr Reuenthal,” Mary said. “Since he’s abandoned us so soon.” She looked over to where Reuenthal was side by side with Mittermeyer, who had relaxed significantly to have him back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard did not say anything about Reuenthal. “It was a good day for a ride, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The weather on Odin is always colder than I remember it being,” the duke said. “I miss the tropics.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you planning to return to Phezzan soon?” Edith asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before the end of the season proper,” the duke replied. “But there’s plenty of life in the capital yet. So I’m told, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you planning to ride out the next few years there?” Edith asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Such a heavy question!” Mary exclaimed. “It’s not exactly the best way to continue a conversation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I only ask because Papa is planning to keep us trapped at home in the countryside,” Edith said. “I’m wondering how bleak next season is going to be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quite,” the duke said. “But it’s hardly only your fault, or mine.” He smiled. “And I don’t mind talking about it. If we are to make plans, we ought to know what we’re planning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I’m glad you don’t mind talking about it,” Edith said. “Do you have assets on Phezzan, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” the duke said. “Or, at least, none worth speaking of. I own a small amount of property, but it’s just a place to stay. Most of my assets are tied up in my estate within the Empire.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, so even if you’re on Phezzan, you’ll be left in the cold if things do go wrong here.” She looked over at Mary, and there was an evil, glint in her eye. “I suppose that’s something that Papa should consider before he gives his blessing for you to marry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is that?” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, he would want to make sure Mary is with someone who would be able to support her on Phezzan, should the worst happen. She’ll have nothing but her husband, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke’s face twitched, or perhaps it was the firelight. “I thought that your mother had inherited a rather large fortune on Phezzan,” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary’s mouth opened, and then shut again, and she squeezed her hands into fists.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, she did,” Edith said. “It’s all been absorbed into the Grantham estate, though. Cousin Matthew is to inherit it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.” The duke smiled. “And what about you, Count Lohengramm?” he asked, looking across the fire and changing the subject. “I assume there’s no convincing you to run away to Phezzan with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no plans to run anywhere,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re a braver man than I,” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps we should go back indoors,” Mary said. “It’s getting rather dark.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate the idea, but I can’t stay for very much longer. I’d just like to say goodbye to Count Grantham before we head off,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about you, Philip?” Mary asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I think I’m of the same opinion as Count Lohengramm,” the duke said. “It’s been a long day, and I have a long ride home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not staying the night?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I had quite forgotten that you had extended that invitation to me.” His eyes roved across the lawn, now bathed in flickering firelight shadows, looking for something and not finding it. “Perhaps it’s best if I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father will be so disappointed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I apologize,” the duke said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something changed in Mary’s bearing; she had made up her mind. “Well, I should at least see if Cousin Matthew or any of your other staff would like to stay for dinner,” she said, nodding at Count Lohengramm. She smiled, a tight expression, and walked off with her head held high to where the other small group, comprised of Matthew, Sybil, Mittermeyer, Reuenthal, and Mecklinger, were standing and talking. They were too far away to hear, but they all shifted at Mary’s approach. Reinhard watched the exchange. It ended with Mary leading Reuenthal away from the group, back towards the house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke watched, too, and said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard was just about to ask Edith if she thought her father was ever going to come back out, when from around the corner of the house, bright white high-beams from a string of cars rolled up into the driveway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edith stopped whatever she had been saying to the duke to turn to look, everyone’s silhouette cut bright in the foggy night air, the car headlights outshining by far the firelight, which had once felt blinding and warm, but now was dim by comparison. “What in the world?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard and Kircheis shared one glance, and then immediately began heading towards the lights. Edith followed, though the duke remained standing by the fire, watching from a distance. Sybil and Matthew had already started walking to investigate, and Mittermeyer and Mecklinger joined up with Reinhard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Getting out of the car, bathed in the harsh vehicle lights, were a swarm of military police. They were armed, but only the usual sidearms, and none of them reached for them even as the group of young people approached.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew, deciding it was his responsibility in the absence of Lord Grantham, positioned himself at the front of the pack.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Officers. May I ask what the trouble is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On the business of His Majesty,” the officer in charge, a captain from his uniform, “we have come to search this estate in connection with a republican terrorist cell.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew was not rendered speechless, but his face paled. He must have known as well as anyone how the military police tended to get their way. “I’m afraid you must speak to Count Grantham,” he said. “This is his estate, and he will not allow--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Resistance predictably caused the officer to grow firmer. “On the business of the Crown, we have the authority to enter any private dwelling. Please stand aside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard flashed a signal to Kircheis behind his back. Be ready to leave. He then stepped forward. “Captain, I would appreciate if you could explain why exactly this house, of all the houses on Odin, has been implicated in terrorism.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking at his uniform, the captain restrained a flinch, then saluted sharply. “Sir, during raids on republican meeting places over the past week, evidence was uncovered that linked an unknown member of one cell to this house.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An unknown member?” Reinhard asked. “This is very little evidence to go on. If you don’t know who you’re looking for, I don’t know what you expect to find.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We hope we will find nothing, sir,” the captain said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should speak to Count Grantham,” Reinhard said. Before the captain had the space to object, Reinhard turned to the pale-faced Sybil, who was biting her lip, and said, “Lady Sybil, please take Captain Kircheis inside to find your father and bring him out here. At the very least, no one should search his estate without his knowledge, if not his consent.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil looked like she could have wept with relief. “Of course!” She turned and sprinted across the yard, faster than Reinhard would have thought possible in her skirts. Kircheis followed, and they vanished into the dark stone house.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Thomas was in the front area of the house when the procession of cars arrived. He had been standing around waiting for the duke to come back in, eager to dress him for the late dinner, but the duke had been dawdling outside with seemingly no intention of reentering the house. Thomas wouldn’t have explained his presence in the front of the house to anyone who asked, but it did allow him to be the first to notice the unexpected arrivals, their headlights piercing right through the gauzy curtains and striking his shadow back on the walls of the foyer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take a genius to know that this was bad news, and Thomas knew exactly who it was bad news for. Although the cars were barely marked, they certainly weren’t regular municipal police, and that meant that they were military. Everyone had heard stories of the military police, operating as more of an independent secret police, moving without oversight and snatching up anyone they deemed a target. At best, those people were quietly killed. At worst, well, it was hard to tell what was overactive imagination and what was true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whoever the military police decided to take into their clutches would be a dead man. And they were unlikely to leave the Grantham estate empty handed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cars came to a halt, and Thomas pulled back the curtain to watch the scene unfold. Matthew von Crawley and most of the rest of the group who had been outside approached the officers at a jog before they could even knock on the doors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He did not want to be the one to open the main door to let them in, so Thomas swiftly turned and headed into the house. He wasn’t sure where he was intending to go, but as he turned towards the servants’ hall, he had a flash of insight. Whatever was happening here may very well ruin the Grantham family’s reputation, but Thomas thought he might be able to turn the situation to his advantage. He hustled downstairs and found Tom loitering in the kitchen, pestering Frau Patmore in his teasing way for a cup of coffee and some of the leftover biscuits. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom,” Thomas said, getting his attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom looked up, mouth full of biscuit that Frau Patmore had passed him, and the expression on Thomas’s face startled him. He nodded and quickly left the kitchen, ignoring Frau Patmore’s confusion. Thomas pulled in into the room where they kept all the livery, and shut the door tight behind them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s military police outside,” he said quickly. “Herr Crawley’s stalling them, but they’ll be in here poking around any second.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom blanched. “What for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For you, I’d think,” Thomas said. “Not like the rest of us belong to any terrorist groups.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to explain that to me,” Thomas said, and jerked his head in the vague direction of the cars outside. “It’s them that’s the problem.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could I run?” Tom asked. “Is there time?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have anything incriminating in your room?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom’s sullen silence told Thomas everything he needed to know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look-- I assume your group or whoever you belonged to didn’t have your name written down plain anywhere. Maybe they don’t know it’s you they’re looking for, or they would have just brought one or two cars to grab you, not a whole line full to search the house.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you saying?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe, as long as we can get rid of the evidence, they won’t be able to pin it on you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Tom said. “Right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell me where all of it is,” Thomas said. “I’ll get rid of it for you. You go pretend everything’s normal, so you won’t be suspected.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would you do that for me?” Tom asked. “What if you get caught with it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t,” Thomas said. “And I owe you.” This was, of course, nowhere close to the reason that Thomas wanted to deal with the incriminating material, but it made Tom look at him with a serious expression and nod.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pull out the middle drawer in my dresser. It’s all taped in a pack on the back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was all Thomas needed. He nodded, let them both out of the livery closet, and made his way up the back stairs to the narrow suite of attic bedrooms in doubletime.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>None of the rooms locked, so it was easy enough to get into Tom’s. It was neat, with a picture of Tom’s family on the desk and a few torn magazine pictures from a car magazine taped to the walls. The narrow window looked out over the top of the house, and Thomas peeked out of it to see that Count Lohengramm was still delaying the military police from getting inside the house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas pulled open Tom’s sock drawer, and reached far back into it, fishing his hand around until his fingers brushed the incriminating envelope, stuffed thick with papers. He pulled it out and rifled through them out of a vague curiosity, but all of them were crammed dense with text that he didn’t have time to read. He just put the drawer back, then left Tom’s room, shutting the door behind him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just down the hall, Bates’s room was silent and empty. Thomas left the door ajar so that he could more easily hear anyone coming and got to work, lifting up Bates’s thin mattress so he could tuck the sheaf of papers underneath it. He removed them from the envelope and stuffed it in his pocket, and made sure to only touch the papers with his gloved left hand, not wanting to leave his prints on them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had just arranged them convincingly when he heard footsteps coming up the stairs. Alarmed, Thomas hastily dropped the mattress and exited Bates’s room. He wasn’t quite fast enough in getting away from the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas?” the man coming up the stairs asked. Thomas turned quickly towards the familiar voice, trying to wipe the fear of being caught off his face. He was startled to see Siegfried-- no, he shouldn’t call him that. He was dressed in a fleet uniform, a captain’s uniform. No longer could Thomas mistake him for a servant-- or delude himself into thinking he was one, that they were equals somehow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I help you, Captain Kircheis?” Thomas asked, keeping his voice neutral. He was still standing in front of Bates’s door, and it was very obvious that it was a room he had just left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m looking for Tom Branson,” Kircheis said. His voice was even, but the sheer force of his regard made Thomas want to squirm away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s out by the garage, I expect,” Thomas said. “Not up here, anyway. What do you need him for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you doing in Herr Bates’s room?” He read the small copper plaque on the wall next to the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Putting some things away for him,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I?” Kircheis asked. Although it was delivered in his usual, quiet tone, it was not a request, but a command. Thomas stood aside. He was half-tempted to protest that Bates wouldn’t like him snooping as Kircheis pushed open the door, but he kept silent. There was something in Kircheis’s manner that made Thomas want to obey him, even when it was against his own best interests.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis took in Bates’s tidy room, including the bedsheets that were hanging untucked and loose from where Thomas had lifted the mattress and had not had time to remake the bed. Thomas was sure that no one else would have noticed, but Kircheis did, and he lifted up the mattress without hesitation and scooped up the papers that Thomas had left there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this everything from Herr Branson’s room?” he asked, looking through them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis wasn’t looking at him at all, and the expression on his face was one of deliberate neutrality. It made Thomas feel so pitiful that he was tempted to break out in a blubbering explanation of what he had been doing, but he just stood there in silence until Kircheis finished flipping through the bundle of papers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you would like to say goodbye to the Duke of Crowsburg,” Kircheis finally said as he tucked the sheaf of papers inside the breast of his uniform, “I suggest you do so now. I suspect he is going to leave as soon as possible, and I doubt he is going to come back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas’s heart gave an odd twist, but he ignored it to ask, “What are you going to do with those?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Destroy them,” he said. “But no one will search my person, if I don’t get a chance to do so immediately. Lord Reinhard and all of the other guests are not implicated. I’m sure we will be allowed to leave without issue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Reinhard will want to stay to ensure the MPs don’t cause Lord Grantham too much trouble,” he said. “But we will not stay long after that. I expect you will be needed to show the MPs around the house. You should do what you need to do before then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis gave him one long look, one that revealed nothing about what he was thinking or feeling, but left Thomas feeling far too exposed, then nodded and headed back down the narrow stairs without another word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quickly, Thomas made Bates’s bed so that he wouldn’t suspect anyone of rifling through his room, then rushed down the stairs and out of the house, into the cold night air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fire that had been burning on the lawn was no longer a bonfire, and was now tame and dimming with every passing second. The duke stood in front of it, alone, watching the driveway as the line of MPs exited their cars and walked up into the Grantham house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t notice Thomas coming until he called out, softly, “Philip--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke turned to look at him. He was quite handsome, with the firelight in his eyes. “I thought you would be busy in there,” he said, nodding to the house. “I’m sure Lord Grantham doesn’t want MPs robbing him of house and home while they turn every one of his silverware drawers inside out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll go back in a second,” Thomas said. “I wanted to see you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you’ve seen me,” Philip said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you leaving?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As soon as my driver tells me that he’s gotten the car out past all of that.” He gestured at the mass of military police cars, all their headlights still on and burning across the cold lawn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish there could have been a better end to the night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can’t all have our druthers,” Philip said. “I’m just glad it’s not a trouble I’m involved in.” He cast a look at Thomas. “You aren’t involved in this at all, are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Thomas said. “Nobody’s out to arrest me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good. Though I realize that if I were you, I wouldn’t tell the truth when asked that question.” He chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re in an odd mood.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s been an odd night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope this all doesn’t spoil you courting Lady Mary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The duke looked down into the fire. “Did you know that there is no fortune for Lady Mary to inherit on Phezzan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It all belongs to Matthew von Crawley. Or will, once Count Grantham dies. It’s tied to the estate, somehow. More the fool was I for not asking about it clearly sooner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, what does this mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It means that, having wasted half the season, I’m going to go back to Phezzan with my hat in my hands, and hope that things don’t go so belly-up here that I will be utterly destitute in a foreign land.” He shook his head. “I played the wrong hand, Thomas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not going to court Lady Mary, then?” He knew that was already clear, but he couldn’t stop himself from asking, half-disbelieving it, even still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not like I was courting her for love,” he said. His attention was caught by someone striding across the grass towards them. “Ah, that’s my driver. He’s gotten the car out. I think it’d be better if I left before anything else goes wrong. Please give Lord Grantham and Lady Mary my regards, if they ask after me, though I rather doubt they will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Philip--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the duke just shook his head, and strode across the grass towards his approaching driver, leaving Thomas alone before the dying fire.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The inside of the house was massively chaotic when Thomas finally slipped back inside. There were uniformed MPs rushing every which way, and Lord Grantham was standing in the foyer with a look of utter despair on his face, shoulders slumped. Beside him, Lady Sybil was chewing her nails. Lady Grantham was following the captain in charge of the MPs around, an indignant response on her tongue for everything he said, even orders to his own men. Lady Edith and Lady Mary were nowhere to be found. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The only people who appeared even remotely calm were Count Lohengramm and his men, distinguishable from the military police easily by their different uniforms, the sleek silver across the chest and shoulders that marked him as an admiral standing out against the drab plain black of the MPs. Count Lohengramm stood in the foyer in front of Lord Grantham, and whenever any of the MPs looked about to approach and say something, Count Lohengramm’s presence seemed to ward them off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although it was well known that the military police had the authority to do as they liked, even going as far as investigating, accusing, or arresting high ranking nobles or fleet officials, Count Lohengramm’s favor from the Kaiser, or at least his sister’s favor, seemed to grant him a small measure of immunity. If he had been the one actively under attack by the whole secret police apparatus, Thomas doubted it would have saved him, but here in Lord Grantham’s house, as a somewhat neutral party, he had some amount of power that he could employ.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unlike Kircheis, he probably wasn’t protecting Lord Grantham out of the kindness of his heart. The sneer in his expression when he looked at any of the military police, like they were insects beneath him, made it clear that he was remaining in the Grantham house because he hated the intrusion on some kind of aesthetic or moral principle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson spotted Thomas as soon as he stuck his head into the foyer. He looked on the verge of a heart attack, beet-red face and sweat pooling on his brow. “Where the devil have you been?” he demanded of Thomas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was making sure the Duke of Crowsburg got off safely,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s gone?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He got in his car with his driver.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One less problem to worry about, then.” Carson said. He seemed about to say something else, but one of the MPs came over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We need to search upstairs bedrooms,” the MP said. “If you could tell your staff to stand aside—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You absolutely do not,” Carson spluttered. “This is beyond unreasonable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you do not tell your staff to stand aside, we will be forced to remove them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson looked at the gun on the MP’s hip, and at the defeated face of Lord Grantham, and the swarm of invaders already turning the house upside down. He didn’t have a leg to stand on. “This way,” he choked out, and led the MP up the main staircase towards the bedrooms. Thomas followed, hanging back a way, but taking some enjoyment out of Carson being brought low.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the front of the hall that led to the family’s bedrooms, Anna and O’brien stood in unison, blocking the way. Thomas gave O’brien an amused look, but she didn’t acknowledge him. Funny, she seemed to have some sort of real loyalty to Lady Grantham, when it came down to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Anna, O’brien,” Carson said with great difficulty. “That will be all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before the MPs could push through into the hallway, Carson stepped through and knocked on the first door, Lady Edith’s. She opened it, looking nervously at the MPs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, Lady Edith,” Carson said. “They’re demanding to search your room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What in the world are they expecting to find?” Her voice was shrill.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me,” the leading MP said, and pushed past her to get inside. Edith covered her mouth with her hand, pressing back against the wall, watching with horror as the police began turning her room upside down. They stripped her bed of all its sheets, overturned the mattress and checked it for hidden compartments, pulled out the drawers of her dresser and desk and dumped them on the bed, pushed furniture away from the walls to check for hidden compartments. A tornado passing through would have done less damage. It was remarkable that she didn’t cry, though tears glistened in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Watching the scene made Thomas feel odd. An involuntary pity, which he sharply rebuked with reason. If there was any satisfaction in having the Grantham family reduced to powerlessness, it vanished under the realization that even now, their nobility carried weight. Edith would survive this indignity. If the MPs had come for someone in a family without a noble name, he doubted the treatment would have been half as gentle as this. And he doubted that whoever was searching the servants’ quarters was sparing any thought to their personal belongings-- and there was certainly no one blockading the door like Anna or O’brien had for the Grantham family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The search concluded in Edith’s room, and they moved on to the next door: Mary’s room. Carson knocked. “Lady Mary,” he called.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a prolonged moment of silence. It stretched on so long that the leader of the MPs made a move to open the door himself, but that turned out to be unnecessary. The door opened, and one of Count Lohengramm’s staff exited the room, the rear admiral with the dark hair whose name Thomas had forgotten. He tugged on the bottom of his uniform jacket to straighten it, gave a nod to all the people standing in the hallway, and pushed his way out past the gaggle of MPs and servants and down the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inside the room, Lady Mary was at least dressed, but she was completely disheveled, her hair loose and her face beet red. She was standing at her dressing table, and she turned away from the onlookers, standing silently as the MPs entered the room and began tearing it apart. Carson abruptly seemed to realize that Thomas, Anna, and O’brien were still standing around, each staring at the scene with the feeling that the normal world was crashing down around their ears, though that clear expression showed on their faces in different ways.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson ordered them all to leave and make themselves useful. Thomas got out of there in a hurry.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The search of the house lasted until well past midnight. Every inch of the place was turned over, with the MPs growing bolder and more desperate to uncover anything the longer the search went on. Thomas was sure that they were going to snatch one of the servants up at random, make an accusation just to have someone to take away and make an example of, but in the end, they found nothing, and with Count Lohengramm’s watchful eye upon them, they were taking fewer risks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was almost certain that they would be back, someday soon. Or maybe long enough from today that the household had relaxed, and the terror of the search would be fresh again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Count Lohengramm’s assistance at keeping the MPs from completely running wild was likely the only thing that stopped Lord Grantham from expelling him and all his staff from the house directly, after Carson whispered in his ear about what had happened in Lady Mary’s room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the military police finally cleared out, it left the house suddenly silent, with no more crashing sounds of silverware drawers being dumped on the floor to check for hidden compartments, or doors being slammed open and shut, or furniture scraped across the floors. Lord Grantham assembled the staff in the foyer, the room that was least ransacked, and bit out a grudging thanks to Count Lohengramm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate you staying,” Lord Grantham said. “You were under no obligation to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is a deep rot in this country,” Count Lohengramm said. “I would find it difficult to stand by and let it consume someone, while I had some power to stop it. Do you know what brought this down on you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Lord Grantham said, though even Thomas, standing at attention and not watching his face, could tell that he was lying. “They must just have been mistaken about whatever evidence they found.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Count Lohengramm nodded. “I hope this does not happen again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope so as well. Goodnight, Count Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was a clear dismissal, and the count and his staff walked out of the house without another word. It was eerie to feel them go. The presence of strangers in the house was the one thing that kept the lid on the pressure vessel that was Carson.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham turned to the staff, once Count Lohengramm was well outside the building. His voice was brutally cold and exhausted, and he looked at the staff with an expression both haunted and furious. “Tonight, this house, my family, has suffered a humiliation beyond what I ever imagined was possible. One of you brought this upon my family, whom I have spent my entire life protecting. One of you brought shame on this house. If I knew who it was--” He stopped and took a deep breath, wincing in some kind of pain. “If I hear one single breath of anything approaching treason, or anything that even comes close, you can rest assured that I will not tolerate it in my house!” He yelled the last words, then sagged, all of the energy he had gathered gone in an instant. “Carson--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, m’lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then Lord Grantham left the foyer, supported on one side by Lady Grantham, his other hand gripping the bannister on the stairs with painfully white knuckles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson was alone in the foyer with the rest of the staff. Daisy was quivering, and all the maids looked shell shocked. Thomas stared Carson down. Bates looked straight ahead at nothing. Tom, on the far end of the line of staff, had his hands clenched into fists.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Grantham may have been content with just firing anyone he suspects of treason,” Carson said finally. “I would not be. Not after tonight.” He glared at each one of the staff in turn, looking into their eyes. “I suggest the person who is responsible for this leave, immediately. Or if you know who is responsible, speak now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A deadly silence stretched across the foyer. Thomas resisted the urge to look at Bates, wondering if he would make an accusation of Thomas. But he was quiet as the grave, and Thomas also kept his mouth shut. Carson let the moment stretch for almost a full minute.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord and Lady Grantham, as well as the young ladies, will be staying in the capital with Lady Rosamund for the next several days while we return this house to the proper order.” He finally said. Although his face was still red with anger, the false normalcy in his voice was worse. “We will begin early.”</span>

LOGH is absolutely /obsessed/ with like what does it mean to be someone's superior or inferior versus being their equal. it's a theme that almost every character wrestles with at some point, and it's probably the most central part of reinhard's arc in the show. if you don't mind spoilers/aren't ever planning to watch LOGH, this theme is best summed up in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX12NVUhceI" rel="nofollow">this clip from e72 [warning: contains the death of a major character] </a>.</p><p>but logh addresses this concept of class in a weirdly abstract way-- "democracy" as a country of equals vs "autocracy" of masters and servants-- despite having a rich worldbuilding background to tie into. it's one of the things that makes me like rattle the bars of my cage and shriek. </p><p>and of course downton abbey is Like That. i don't think you need me to go into how DA addresses class lmao.</p><p>but anyway-- where was i trying to go with this note? i guess Thomas is just always acutely aware of how these divides work, and even at the lowest moment, the Granthams still have more ability to stay safe in this society than Thomas ever will.</p><p>in other news: we do love a classic "thomas tries to frame bates for something" scheme. too bad kircheis is there being a goody-two-shoes about it lmao. he was obviously sent up there on sybil's behest to warn tom what was going on after reinhard sent them both inside.</p><p>fucking reuenthal doing his absolute best to ruin the lives of everyone he encounters. i love him but he is a bastard for sure. i was tempted, while planning this story, to make reuenthal duel somebody, but then i couldn't figure out who to make him duel or how to get that to work plot wise, so i had to drop it. reuenthal duel scene coming.... sometime during <i> Silent Spiral </i> in WIAW if i'm remembering my plan correctly</p><p>maybe if i was ever going to write a draft 2 of this story (i'm not likely ever going to do that) i would try to work all those other ideas i missed out on into here haha. i do worry that this story is a bit underwritten-- everything happens very fast and a lot happens off screen. but i hope you're enjoying despite that haha. i'd love to hear what you think.</p><p>anyway the title of this chapter does come from 'last gasp at calama' (the Mountain Goats song)</p><p>socials: javert @ tumblr , natsinator @ twitter , gayspaceopera.carrd.co , https://discord.gg/2fu49B28nu</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Sybil was not completely surprised by the quiet knock on her bedroom door. It came after the whole household had collapsed into their respective beds, exhausted and miserable beyond belief. It was bold of Tom to be up and about. If he was caught sneaking into her room, she doubted that her father would have any pity on him whatsoever. And Carson would probably murder him directly. Still, Sybil dragged herself out of bed and opened the door for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was still dressed in his day clothes, but she was in her nightgown, and she pulled a blanket off her bed and wrapped it around herself while she stood to talk to him, her bedside table lamp dim and only revealing fuzzy edges of his expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay?” Tom asked, his voice low. He looked around the bedroom. It was still completely torn apart. All her clothes were tossed in a heap on the floor, the drawers of her dressing table upended, the rugs kicked into shapeless oblivion. Only her bed had been put together enough to sleep on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m alright,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The pamphlets I gave you--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I burned them,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you alright?” She asked this with some hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m alive,” Tom said. “I’m not--” He choked up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They were after me, I’m sure,” he said. “Martin’s gone. And the rest of them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry,” Sybil said, and she meant it. The petty trouble of having her room turned inside out seemed inconsequential, in comparison to the fact that Tom’s friends were likely dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how they tracked me here,” Tom said. “Martin must have left some sort of trail in his notes, maybe didn’t code it thoroughly enough…” He shook his head. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to do anything,” Sybil said. “They didn’t catch you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think they won’t come back?” Tom asked. “The secret police, they don’t stop hunting you, not until they get someone.” He took a shuddering breath. “I’m a dead man. Or someone else is, if they follow some trail they imagine and catch someone else in the house by accident.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil wasn’t sure what to say to that. “I hope not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom shook his head. “Hope’s not going to save anybody,” he said. “I have to get off Odin. If I can get to Phezzan, or the rebel territories--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’d leave?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve turned my life over once,” Tom said. “I guess I have to do it again. If I want to keep living, that is.” He couldn’t meet her eyes. “If I run, there won’t be any more suspicion on the rest of the household, since they’ll assume anybody who’s running away is a guilty party.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you make it there? Will you have to go under false papers?” She figured that anyone from the household would be watched very closely, if they tried to leave the country. For a while, at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Tom said. “I--” He was exhausted, probably more than she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright, Tom,” she said. “You don’t have to know it all now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked at her. “What would your father do, if he caught me here, talking about this with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was an abrupt change of subject, and Sybil was taken aback. “He’s not going to. Everyone’s asleep, except us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But if he did--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you trying to ask?” She could tell his line of questioning wasn’t really about her father, not with the way Tom was looking at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If your father was going to throw me to the hounds,” Tom said, “would you try to stop him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s not--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He said as much, when he addressed the staff earlier,” Tom said. Sybil had already been upstairs with Edith at that point. Sybil felt cold, and pulled her blanket tightly around herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He said that?” she asked. Tom nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could you bear it?” he asked. “Could you stand to watch, if one of us had been dragged away?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would you ask me that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because it’s real, Sybil. It could have happened. It’s going to happen, soon enough. If the police come back, they won’t leave without a body, next time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What could I do?” Sybil asked, and her voice broke, plaintive. “Papa couldn’t do anything. I wouldn’t be able to--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Grantham believes in all of this,” he said. “He wouldn’t try-- didn’t try to stop it.” He shook his head. “He was more concerned about them stealing silverware and cracking the spines of rare books in the library than he was about us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not fair to say,” she said. “You don’t know what would have happened if the police had really made an accusation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I do know,” Tom said. He stopped, then said, “I’m sorry. Your father is a good man-- it’s been a hard day for us all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just--” He threw his hands wide. “Can this go on forever, Sybil? Can anyone keep living like this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have to,” she said. “What can we do?” She looked around at the destroyed room. “This is what even thinking of something different gets you, isn’t it? And if we did really try to resist, if Papa had met them with hunting guns at the door--” She shivered and pulled her blanket tighter around her shoulders, looking away from Tom. “Not all of us can run away to Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom was silent for a long second. She felt his gaze on her, and met his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come with me,” Tom said. “It will be easier for both of us to get off planet if you arrange it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t!” Sybil said, and she said it a little too loudly, loud enough that Tom looked around, as if Carson might suddenly leap out of the emptied closet to haul him down to the police himself. “I can’t,” she repeated in a harsh whisper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?” Tom asked. “You don’t have an inheritance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have a family,” she said. “I couldn’t just leave them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your mother’s family is on Phezzan,” Tom said. “It’s not like they couldn’t come see you, if they wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why are you even asking me this?” Sybil hissed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because--” Tom seemed torn on what to say. “You’re not like all the rest of them,” he said. “You could never really be happy here, not after all of this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Couldn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you,” Tom said. “I know you, Lady Sybil.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you?” she asked, and this time, her voice was cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Tom said. “I wish I hadn’t been mistaken.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think it serves anyone well to tell me what I should feel,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re right, m’lady.” He took a few steps backwards, his own voice now cold, his eyes harder than they had been. He put his hand on the door, intending to leave. “Goodnight, m’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom--” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you need any help getting to Phezzan--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded. “Thank you.” And then he was out the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he left, Sybil sat heavily on her bed. Although she had been nearly asleep when he first knocked, she was wide awake now, and her thoughts refused to stop turning over and over. She felt strangely morose, beyond just the terror of the day. Tom’s prediction that she couldn’t be happy ever again had unsettled her.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sybil woke early the next morning against her will. Anna came into her room and shook her shoulder gently, disentangling her from the twisted mess she had made of her bedsheets during the night, kicking and thrashing with disturbed dreams.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“M’lady,” Anna said, “Lord Grantham would like to leave for Lady Rosamund’s house as soon as he can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Sybil slowly came into full consciousness, Anna did her best to find an outfit that was as unsullied as possible from the mess of clothes that still lay haphazard on the floor, and by the time that Sybil had brushed her teeth and splashed some water on her face and combed her hair, Anna was ready to help her into a dress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are you doing, Anna?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m alright, m’lady,” she said. “Last night gave us all quite a scare, but I think we’ll come through it.” She laced the back of Sybil’s dress. “A clean conscience settles the mind wonderfully.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think there is someone in the staff who brought this here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, m’lady. Of course not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Bates told me it’s because Lord Grantham is going to support Duke Braunschweig, when His Majesty dies,” Anna said. She tugged on Sybil’s sleeves and tied the decorative ribbons at her elbows. “Marquis Littenheim has connections within the military police. Herr Bates says it’s just intimidation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Sybil said, completely nonplussed. “I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s why Lord Grantham is going to have you all go home early,” she said. “You’ll at least be safe away from the capital.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Sybil asked, stiffening. “We’re going to leave Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As soon as we can pack the household, m’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But the season--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There will be other seasons,” Anna said. “Once things are settled again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anna was a little amused. She finished fussing with Sybil’s outfit. “Lady Sybil, if you object, you’ll have to take it up with Lord Grantham-- I’m afraid I can’t do anything about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anna was right, of course, so Sybil ceased her objections for the moment and headed down to breakfast. Her father had already eaten and left, so it was just her, alone at the table, with Thomas standing in the corner to serve.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once Sybil had gotten her eggs and toast, she asked him, “Have you heard we’re packing to leave, Thomas?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had heard, m’lady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you coming with the family, back home?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A dark expression came over Thomas’s face, but he stifled it back into the perfectly smooth servant’s mask. “I don’t know. Herr Carson hasn’t said anything about it one way or the other. I expect it’s a great expense to move staff back and forth between the houses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you wanted to, I’m sure it wouldn’t be any trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, m’lady.” His voice gave no indication of if he wanted to or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did the Duke of Crowsburg get off alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I imagine so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked down into her coffee and frowned. Thomas stared into space, not offering anything else for her to latch onto and continue the conversation with. She was finished with her breakfast before Mary or Edith even came down, and this only deepened her sense of malaise. She headed outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The car that would seat all of them was already idling in front of the house, though Tom was nowhere to be seen, and her father was pacing back and forth, speaking on his phone to someone. Sybil stood nearby and listened to the conversation long enough to hear that it was her father arguing about chartering a merchant ship to take the household off Odin. This was obviously difficult to do on short notice, and her father, though he offered her a thin smile when he saw her, grew more and more terse and his scowl deeper and deeper as the agent for the merchant company quoted him different times and prices. Her father eventually said that he would get back to him with what would work best, and hung up the phone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sybil, darling, I’m sorry I missed you at breakfast.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” she said. “I understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are you?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine.” She looked at him, and the question she wanted to ask slipped out without her intending to say anything. “Papa,” she said, “could I stay here on Odin, with Aunt Rosamund?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was brought up short. “Certainly not,” he said. “Whatever would you want to do that for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—” There was no false explanation that didn’t sound like a spoiled whine, even to her own ears, and the true explanation was something that she couldn’t give voice to. “I like it here,” she said. “And I don’t want to miss the rest of the season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” her father said. “It’s out of the question.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would be perfectly safe, and Aunt Rosamund and Granny could look after me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For one thing, I’m going to do my best to get Rosamund and your grandmother to leave Odin as well. You and your mother and your sisters—it’s become quite clear that you are not safe here.” He shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Papa—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t understand what’s brought this on you so suddenly.” He pursed his lips. “Sybil, my dear, I have the bad feeling that this planet is about to become a warzone. I couldn’t live with myself if I let you stay here.” He paused. “Your mother isn’t happy with this, either. But she understands. It will only be for a few years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is Mama unhappy?” Sybil asked. She wondered if she could get her mother to turn the tide in her favor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father just shook his head. “Don’t bother her about it. She knows it has to be done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil frowned but nodded. She walked away from her father, who watched her go and then pulled out his phone to make another call.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morose, Sybil wandered the grounds for a while, kicking up the dry fall leaves on the ground. Her breath steamed out in front of her, and the sky was a wan blue through the thinning leaves of the trees. The house, in its heavy stone, lingered in the corner of her eye as she circled it, not wanting to get too far in case her family suddenly became ready to leave. From the outside, at least, the house was untouched. The chaos of the night before hadn’t injured its structure in the least, just shaken everyone up inside, like they were bugs in a jar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took out her own phone and, though it was early, dialed Magdalena. Magdalena answered, sleep heavy in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sybil, darling, I’m glad to hear you call me,” Maggie said. “I heard about what happened.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who told you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Practically everyone,” she said. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t have been able to do anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm,” Maggie said, “maybe not about the police. But other things.” She sighed. “Regardless—it’s undignified.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re alright,” Sybil said. “Nobody was hurt, really.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound terrible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Papa is going to move us all off Odin as soon as he can charter a ship to take us home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena let out a huge rush of breath on the other end of the line, forcing Sybil to move the phone away from her ear. “The season is about to be so dreadfully boring.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie—” Sybil began, a hesitant tone in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, darling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you planning on going to Phezzan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phezzan?” She could just picture Magdalena curling a strand of her hair, still lounging in bed. “There’s less that entertains me on Phezzan than there is here. I wouldn’t, at least not until after the Kaiser dies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you ask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Sybil said. She scuffed at the cold ground with her heel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you planning to go to Phezzan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have a… friend… who needs to get to Phezzan. And it would be better if he was travelling as someone’s accompaniment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a pregnant silence from the other end of the line. “Your secret suitor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m right, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that’s what you want to call it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you want me to take him to Phezzan? Or you?” Magdalena asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what I want,” Sybil admitted. “I guess what I want isn’t possible anymore. If it ever was.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be so glum, darling.” But even her voice had a hint of falseness in it. “You’ll figure it out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I’ll be very happy at home,” she said. “I really don’t want to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could tell your father you want to stay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did. He won’t listen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose he would be too worried about your virtue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My safety, really, I think,” she said. “He is worried.” Sybil bent down and picked up a perfect red oak leaf off the ground and spun it around between her fingers. “I can’t tell if he’s overreacting or not. Are you worried?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t concern yourself with me,” Magdalena said. “I always find my way through.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are worried, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not about myself, darling.” She paused. “Count Lohengramm’s sister, Countess Grunewald. I’m worried about her.” She let out a little laugh, not her practiced one, but one that teetered on the edge of despair. “If I could snatch her away and hide her on Phezzan, I would.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I ask you a question, Maggie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you knew something was about to happen to Countess Grunewald, what would you do to stop it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anything,” Magdalena said instantly. “Whatever I could.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if—I don’t know. You’d give up your title?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anything,” Magdalena repeated. There was a long moment of silence. “Why do you ask? Are you thinking of doing something drastic for your mystery man?” Her tone was lighter now, joking to escape the implications of the previous second. Sybil didn’t take her too seriously when she said, “I’ll tell you now, Sybil, darling: men aren’t worth it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Sybil said. “I was just wondering… What would my father do to protect us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again, a beat of silence. “He’d take you home and keep you off Odin,” Magdalena said. “And you can hope that’s all it takes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should go,” Sybil said. “I’ll see if I can talk to you again before we leave. Maybe I can sneak out for lunch or something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you need anything from me, let me know,” Magdalena said. “Really, Sybil.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will. Thank you, Maggie.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her family’s mood on the drive to Aunt Rosamund’s house in the capital was sullen. Mary, pale and pinched in a way that Sybil had never seen her before, stared out the window. Edith was indignant about the season being ruined, and blamed it on Mary, but had the good sense to keep her mouth shut. Sybil couldn’t stop turning things over in her head, and it was made worse every time she glanced towards the driver’s seat, where Tom’s hands were white on the wheel. Her father had his computer balanced on his lap, and he was tapping out messages in his two-fingered way, holding the laptop steady with his other hand. Her mother pretended to read a book, but her eyes actually rested on Mary, who ignored her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The mood did not improve when they greeted Aunt Rosamund and crammed themselves into the guest bedrooms of her home. Nor did things get better at dinner when Sybil’s grandmother showed up. The atmosphere was foul, but everyone seemed to realize it would only be made worse by talking about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After dinner, all of the women retreated to the parlor, except for the dowager countess, who, tired of the oppressive air, made her apologies and went to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil’s father met her in the long, dark entrance hall. Sybil could hear their distant voices, and she wanted to know if her grandmother would be coming back home with them or not. Her grandmother was speaking so loudly that it was almost like she wanted to be heard. Her sisters, mother, and aunt were paying no attention to her, so Sybil slipped out of the parlor and stood in a dark crevasse of the hallway, between two heavy wooden pillars, to listen to her father and grandmother talk. They were disagreeing, and the city streetlights were the only illumination in the hall, keeping her grandmother’s frail form in deep shadow, and the edge of her father’s nose in light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And stay there on my daughter-in-law’s generosity?” her grandmother asked. “I don’t know if either of us could tolerate that for long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are plenty of places you could stay that are not the house proper,” her father replied. “You know that better than I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father left me my house on Odin as mine and mine alone when he died. I do intend to stay in it for as long as I am able.” She shook her head. “Rosamund will say the same thing about this place, I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can come back to it when Elizabeth has taken the throne.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Robert, you are very sure of so many things that I would not be half so confident about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duke Braunschweig is a capable man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure Cora will agree, when you put on that fool uniform, and he leads you to get killed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil covered her mouth with her hand, preventing herself from gasping aloud and giving herself away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you’re making a mistake,” her grandmother continued. “And I think neither your wife nor your daughters will ever forgive you for pushing them away so that you can play hero like you’re twenty-five again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duke Braunschweig will need men with experience as leaders.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are other men, Robert.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going to argue with you about this, Mama.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you dragging your heir into this with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not dragging anybody. Matthew’s life is his own. But he was only a lieutenant-- there’s no reason for him to get involved. I retired as a rear admiral.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you should do this, Robert, and you die, you will be leaving your daughters unmarried, and un-cared for, and the estate in the hands of a man who knows nothing about it. I did not expect that kind of irresponsibility from you. Not now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil’s father shook his head. “Go home with Cora and the girls,” he said. “If the worst happens, you know the estate, you’d be abe to make sure Matthew does right by it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no interest in watching what your father cared for, and what generations of his family built, be played with like a children’s toy by some middle class lawyer. I doubt he’d listen to a word I say. And you have no guarantee that he’d provide for Cora and the girls beyond what you stipulate in your will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t argue with you about this, Mama,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I find it difficult to understand.” She leaned heavily on her cane. “Since Mary was born, I have heard you say again and again that there is nothing more important to you than that estate. You wouldn’t even break the entail, or move Cora’s money to Phezzan, because of the estate-- and look where that’s gotten Mary!” Her voice was as shrill as Sybil had ever heard it. “You would throw that all away, for what? And don’t tell me it’s for the sake of your wife and daughters, because it’s not, Robert. You’ve never been good at lying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duke Braunschweig is going to win whatever struggle there is going to be,” her father said, speaking slowly, but with the confidence born of conviction. “It probably will not be easy for him, but he is more equipped for this kind of battle. Families who support him will be rewarded, families who go against him will be punished. It’s important to be on the right side, and to end this quickly. If we don’t, there won’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>be</span>
  </em>
  <span> an estate. There might not even be much of a crown.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Hoff </span>
  </em>
  <span>Kaiserin Elizabeth,” Sybil’s grandmother muttered. “It’s not worth that gamble, and you’re making a mistake. Your wife and daughters will not forgive you, even just for leaving them alone for two years, or however long this takes, let alone if you get killed. Don’t be stupid, Robert. I didn’t raise a stupid son.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to insult me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that’s what it takes to get through to you, I will do whatever it takes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We shouldn’t argue about this now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When are you going to tell the girls?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When they leave for home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They won’t forgive you for that, either. I wouldn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight, Mama,” Robert said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quickly, Sybil retreated back into the parlor before her father turned back towards her hiding place, her heart beating wildly in her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sybil couldn’t sleep that night in her guest bedroom in Rosamund’s house. She kept turning over and over, flinging her elbow up to cover her eyes in desperation, even though the room was already pitch black.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom had been right, more right than she had wanted to imagine. Maybe her father wouldn’t have turned in one of the staff to the military police himself, but he cared about some kind of duty to the crown more than he cared about his family. His conversation with her grandmother had made that quite clear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could just imagine how horrible it was going to be, the whole family leaving Odin without Papa, and then not knowing when they would see him again. That would add a new layer of horror to being trapped so far away from the rest of civilization. She didn’t think she would be able to bear it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And why should she!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If her father cared more about a claimant to the crown than he did his own daughters’ happiness-- and it was clear that he did-- then she was going to have to look out for herself. Or she would be trapped, maybe even forever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It might have been one thing if her father had believed that Duke Braunschweig and his daughter would make the Empire a better place. But that wasn’t what he had said to her grandmother. If he had believed that, he certainly would have said it. Her father tended to say what he meant. But all he talked about was the same stabbing in the back, the same scramble for money and power, the same clinging to the old ways… She didn’t want to be like that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, there were no good choices. It was obvious that her father would support Duke Braunschweig, even just with his name and money, since they were friends-- however much anyone could be friends in the court. And even if he hadn’t been, she was sure that Marquis Littenheim was no better or worse. But the way he was enthusiastic about it, in his way, ready to throw himself upon the fire for the cause, it made her stomach drop. He wanted to fight to make it so nothing in the world would change, so that they could continue a war with the rebel territories without interruption, so that the military police could continue to crack down on anyone they considered a threat to the crown, so that the kind of polished court dance of alliances and subterfuges could continue unabated for the next hundred years. The next thousand years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rolled over on the bed again and buried her face in the pillow, biting back a frustrated noise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom was right.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Admitting that made her path much clearer, even if it also made it that much more difficult. She would never be happy, shipped off to the countryside against her will, without her father, certainly without the friend she had in Tom, and without any hope of bettering herself or the world by getting an education. She couldn’t be the type of person who stood by and watched as everyone else made decisions for her, or went along with the way things had always been done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil slipped out of bed and pulled on her jacket. In bare feet, she quietly pushed open her bedroom door and tiptoed through the unfamiliar house, towards the back stairway towards the servants’ quarters. There were plenty of empty rooms: Aunt Rosamund only kept a few staff, and only O’brien, Bates, and Tom had joined her family here. Sybil made a bet that Tom was the one with the light showing through the crack underneath his door at well past midnight, and she knocked on it as softly as she could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence, and then the door swung open. He was in his nightshirt and little else, and he smiled to see her, though he held his finger to his lips before letting her in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To what do I owe the honor of your visit?” Tom asked in a whisper after he shut the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I changed my mind,” she said. “I’ll go with you to Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t like me to say that I knew you would,” he said, but he was grinning. She couldn’t help but smile back. His eyes sparkled in the amber light of the dusty lamp on the desk. “What made you change it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just realized you were right. About everything. I can’t be my own person if I stay here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What else could it be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping you’d say you wanted some more time to enjoy my company.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil flushed and looked away. Tom almost laughed, but covered his mouth to stop himself. The walls here were so thin, she imagined that the creaking sound she could hear might not be the wind, but could be Bates rolling over in bed in the next room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are we going to do this?” Tom asked, suddenly serious. “I assume we’re going to be on some kind of watchlist if we try to leave the country.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Sybil said. “I have family on Phezzan, so it wouldn’t be unheard of for me to go there. As for passage… there’s ships heading to Phezzan all the time, so it wouldn’t be as difficult as my father trying to charter a ship to go home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How will you get the money?” Tom asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll…” She frowned. “I’ll figure something out.” She would have to steal from her father. Although she was sure she could, and a plan was already hatching in her head to visit the capital bank with a check with his signature on it and take out the money she needed, that didn’t make it feel any better or more sure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your family will try to stop you if they hear about this,” Tom said. “You can’t be obvious.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Sybil said. “I won’t say a word.” The thought of that, leaving without saying goodbye, hurt, but it was no worse than what her father was planning to do. That justified her somewhat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When should we plan to leave?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how soon my father can book a ship to take everyone back home,” she said. “That gives us a few days, at least. But we should be fast.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right. The sooner the better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The more she talked about this plan with Tom, the more real it felt, and the more the sinking feeling in her chest deepened. But he was smiling so widely, so buoyed by his vision of the future, that some of her doubts slipped away.</span>

  <span>“Did the date for our departure for Astarte finally get set?” Kircheis asked. He was standing at the counter in their little kitchenette, slicing some cake. They hadn’t wanted to discuss work matters at dinner, not when they were in the communal dining room downstairs eating with their landladies and the other tenants. Now that they were upstairs for their own dessert, they were free to talk about whatever they liked. Reinhard was seated at their table, looking out the window at the garden down below. It was the pitch dark of a late autumn evening, so he could see very little. The wind rattled past the glass, sending its cold little fingers in to raise goosebumps on Reinhard’s arms, his shirtsleeves rolled up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, finally,” Reinhard said. “I’ve been tired of the hurry up and wait.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good. The fleet has been ready to go, so at least it won’t be a rush to prepare.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re taking a smaller fleet anyway. It would hardly require that much time, even if we were starting from nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis just smiled and brought the cake over, setting down Reinhard’s slice before taking his own seat. The cake was decorated with fruit, and he had given Reinhard the piece with the nicest looking strawberry on top. Reinhard didn’t comment on this, but he did pull the strawberry off with his fork, delicately, and eat it first, his eyes twinkling at Kircheis, who had his own little smile, looking down at his cake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad to be heading back into space,” Reinhard said, leaning back in his seat and tilting his head to the ceiling. “Do you think </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde </span>
  </em>
  <span>has missed me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As much as you’ve missed her, Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said, which just made Reinhard laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Soon, you’ll have your own flagship,” he said. “You’ll be a commodore after this, and then…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s no need to rush it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard sat back up straight. “You should have a rank commensurate with your talent!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis placidly took a bite of cake. “If I have my own flagship, there would be no reason to travel on </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span> with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard, who had not considered this until just now, and was rather horrified by the reality of the idea, hated backing down even more. He frowned, even as he said, “I want people to see you as my equal, and that means having a ship of your own. I don’t want to stifle you by having you always at my heels.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis tilted his head but said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What, Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is a matter of image, then,” he said. “And we could bear to be apart in order to achieve--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You tricked me!” Reinhard said, annoyed. “Don’t do that, Kircheis.” He huffed and poked at his cake. “It would be one thing to have separate flagships, because we would always be able to come home…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said, then trailed off when he saw Reinhard’s scowl wasn’t fading, even with his gentle voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s like you don’t want to be together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t be cruel, Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said, and his voice was pained. “You know I want more than anything for you and Lady Annerose and myself to live together. It will just take time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard looked away from him. “The Kaiser will promote me when we get back from Astarte,” he said. “He said as much, last time we spoke. I’ll be a fleet admiral.” His eyes danced around the walls of their apartment, taking in the cozy hearth, the worn furniture, the open door to his bedroom where he and Kircheis had spent many long and cold nights curled up together, the creaky and pitted but still warm wooden floors, the space that was theirs and theirs alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>These were the rooms where he had formed his first alliances with strangers, with Reuenthal and Mittermeyer. These were the walls that had held whispered plans and dreams. This was where he had celebrated with Kircheis after first touring </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span>, after every milestone of their careers. It had been his refuge after every social snub, every brutal fleet meeting that made him want to tear his hair out. He remembered-- that time he had tried to fistfight Luneburg at a party-- he had come home and stomped around on this floor until Kircheis had calmed him down enough to go to bed. It was not simple military housing: it was more of a home than he had had since he was ten.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you will, Lord Reinhard,” Kircheis said. That snapped him out of his reverie, stopped him from picturing the ghosts of himself and Kircheis inhabiting this flat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t have any excuses left after that, will I?” He turned back to his cake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You ran out a while ago,” Kircheis said. “But I don’t know if anyone will be able to ignore it anymore, not when you’ll be the most celebrated admiral in the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard opened his mouth to try to change the angle of the conversation, but before he could say anything else, there was a knock on the door to their flat. He glanced at Kircheis, whose face smoothed over into an expressionless mask. Kircheis stood up to get the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of their landladies was standing there when Kircheis opened it. “Oh, Herr Red,” she said in her lighthearted way, “there’s a gentleman here asking after Herr Yellow.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who is it?” Reinhard asked, leaning back in his chair so that the landlady could see him past Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A Herr Crawley,” she said. “He says he’s your solicitor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This disrupted even Kircheis’s placidity. “Show him up, please,” he said. The landlady nodded and headed back downstairs. “You weren’t expecting him, were you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d have told you if I was,” Reinhard said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They didn’t have very much time to speculate about what it was that Matthew wanted, because he appeared at their door just a moment later, hat in hand, looking as desperate as a man could look. His hair was swept back from his face in the peaky way that hair got when one combed their fingers through it over and over. His face was drawn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard stood to greet him, and Kircheis let him in the apartment and shut the door behind him without a word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Crawley,” Reinhard said, “I won’t waste your time by pretending you haven’t come on urgent business. Please, sit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Count Lohengramm,” Matthew said. He took the offered chair at the dining table. “I wasn’t sure where else to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis went into the kitchen and put on water for tea, but while he waited for it to boil, he stood in the doorway to listen to Reinhard’s conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume this visit is not on your business as my solicitor,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I’ve come to ask a favor. I’m sorry for barging in on you at home, but--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s the kind of thing that can’t be spoken of on the phone?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This apartment is secure,” Kircheis said from the kitchen doorway. “You can speak freely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew nodded, unsurprised. Still, it took him a moment to speak. When he did, his voice was rough, though steady. “My cousin, Lady Sybil, and one of the staff from Lord Grantham’s house, a man by the name of Tom Branson, have both disappeared.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard balled his hands into fists under the table. “Taken by the police?” he asked, voice cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Matthew said. “I don’t think so, anyway.” His brow was furrowed. “Some money was taken from one of Lord Grantham’s accounts a few days before they left, a lot of it. It looks much more like she ran away with him. I suspect she’s already on a ship bound for Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To be young and in love,” Kircheis said from the kitchen. Although his voice was light, trying to relax Matthew, Reinhard caught something else in it. The kettle had finished boiling. He brought over a mug of tea and a slice of cake for Matthew. He didn’t sit down, and he met Reinhard’s eye. “I’m sure you remember-- Baroness Westpfale had mentioned that Lady Sybil had a secret suitor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that were all it was, I feel like she would have said something to her sisters, at least,” Matthew said. “I have the horrible feeling that it’s something else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like what?” Reinhard asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Grantham is worried that Lady Sybil has been kidnapped, or is going to be used as a hostage. He’s convinced of it. He thinks Branson must have been the terrorist who brought the police to the door.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume he wouldn’t even entertain the notion of Lady Sybil eloping with a servant,” Reinhard said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew barked out a laugh. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But Lord Grantham hasn’t convinced you of his belief?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew shook his head. He seemed like he wanted to say something, but was hesitant for some reason. “I convinced Lord Grantham to hold off on speaking to the police about this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis turned and vanished into his bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil could be said to have legitimate reason to go to Phezzan,” Matthew finally said. “She has a grandmother there, and some other relatives. For a worldly young woman whose father has decided that she can’t stay on Odin, it’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>unreasonable</span>
  </em>
  <span> for her to leave the country. But if attention is drawn to it, especially to her leaving without her father’s blessing-- the police might assume that she and Branson are running for other reasons.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do you think, Herr Crawley?” Reinhard asked. He looked him in the eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All I know is that Lord Grantham is desperate to bring his daughter home, and I don’t think he realizes that his desperation could cause her to end up--” He cut himself off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis returned. He held a brown envelope full of papers and he laid it down on the table in front of Matthew.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you were going to get rid of those,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hadn’t finished reading them,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew picked up the papers and flipped through them, his face growing pale as his suspicions were confirmed. “These were Lady Sybil’s?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “They were Herr Branson’s. But Lady Sybil knew all about them, and knew to warn Herr Branson about the police.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew was silent as his eyes scanned the top lines of the papers one by one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe Lord Grantham needs to know about this,” Kircheis said, after giving him a moment to process their contents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not,” Matthew said. He dropped the papers back down to the table like they were alive and malicious. “I never did thank you for your assistance, the other night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was no trouble,” Reinhard said. “I suggest that you try very hard to convince Lord Grantham that Lady Sybil is eloping, and mention none of this to him. If you need help convincing him of that, Baroness Westpfale would be happy to supply the evidence.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he is convinced of that, I’m not sure what I could do to stop him from contacting the police and trying to have her dragged back,” Matthew said. “That’s why I came to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, go on, Herr Crawley,” Kircheis said. He collected the papers and folded his hands over them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hate to ask such a favor, but you’re the only one--” He collected himself. “Admiral Lohengramm, Lord Grantham and I would be eternally in your debt if you could find Lady Sybil and bring her back home, without alerting the police. You have a ship of your own, a fast one. You’re the only person who could stop her before she reaches Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was a major imposition. Reinhard’s brow furrowed, thinking of the dispatch that his whole fleet was about to embark on. “I--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What if we find her, and she doesn’t want to come back?” Kircheis asked. “I haven’t spoken to her much, but Lady Sybil seems like a woman who knows her own mind. If she’s left of her own volition, I doubt she would be eager to return.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Matthew said. “I can’t ask you to drag her, kicking and screaming.” He ran his hand through his hair again. “If I can show Lord Grantham she’s alright, at least, that would be enough to keep things from getting out of hand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard looked at Kircheis, their eyes meeting across the table. What did he see there? Kircheis gave him no indication of what he should do, his face totally still. But even so, Reinhard knew what Kircheis wanted from him. “Alright,” Reinhard said. “If we can find what merchant freighter she boarded, we’ll go after her before she makes it to Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew’s posture changed in immediate relief: he smiled and his shoulders lost their tension. “Thank you,” he said. “I can’t express how grateful I am.” He was an earnest man, in his tone and bearing-- this softened Reinhard’s annoyance somewhat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Finding which ship she’s on may be more difficult than catching it,” Reinhard said. “Kircheis--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You remember the man on Phezzan who helped us when we were chasing--” Kircheis asked, and then fell silent, since the details of that military mission remained secret, even long after the fact.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Muller?” Reinhard asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Kircheis said. “He might be able to get ahold of the passenger manifests as part of his official business, without alerting anyone that he’s looking for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Reinhard said. “I’ll get in contact with him tonight. I’ll owe him, if he is able to do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll worry about that later,” Kircheis said. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite everything, it remained a pleasure to be back on board the </span>

  </em>
  <span>. The crew of the ship were well trained to ask no questions about the nature of Reinhard’s personal business. When the Kaiser had granted him the ship, he had also been granted the right to take her wherever he pleased, whenever he pleased, when he was not on the course of official work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde </span>
  </em>
  <span>was a slick ship, slipping through space with her well tuned engine. Even far from any star, under her own running lights, she glowed against the velvet blackness of space. Her white paint stood out, both when she was in port and when she was among the rest of his fleet. A more cowardly commander might have balked at having a flagship that announced herself so loudly, made herself such an easy target, but Reinhard was not that kind of man. If he was only allowed one vanity, it would have been in that ship. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Today, there was no fleet for the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span> to stand out from: she was alone in space, stalking her helpless pray like a mountain lion stalked a deer. Muller, one of the Imperial attaches to Phezzan, had indeed been able to provide Reinhard with the name of the ship that Lady Sybil had boarded, and from there there it was a simple matter to chase the ship down. They would be coming up to the other ship soon: less than an hour, according to the navigator. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were lucky that Lady Sybil only had a day’s headstart. If they had needed to chase her all the way to Phezzan, it would have taken far too long. This jaunt would only take them about three days, to the ship and back. The </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span> was faster than any merchant vessel in the universe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard sat in his customary place on the bridge, Kircheis standing at his side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re in a better mood than you were when we left,” Kircheis observed, leaning down to Reinhard’s shoulder. Although he could speak freely when standing on the command dais, they both enjoyed the closeness of him leaning in. There was no need for him to whisper because there was no chance of being overheard, despite Reinhard’s bridge crew at their consoles all around. There was a wall of modulated air that surrounded the admiral’s chair and stopped any sound from escaping onto the rest of the bridge. It always felt strange to walk through, like an invisible, humming wall of static that raised every hair on the body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I?” Reinhard asked. He reached up to tug on a lock of Kircheis’s red hair. “I hadn’t noticed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis just smiled. “You like being in space.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if I do?” Kircheis was right, of course. It wasn’t truly an escape from the strictures of Odin, to be out here on his ship, but it was as much of his own world as it could be. When he had first been given his own command, there had been a part of him, tiny though it was, that was tempted to take the ship and fly it as far from the Empire as he could get. But even with the freedom a ship afforded, he was tied to the Kaiser by his sister.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just happy that doing a favor isn’t making you resentful,” Kircheis teased. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil is a pleasant woman,” Reinhard said, only grumbling a little. “I have no objections to making sure she’s safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll be within hailing range in a few minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think we’ll be able to convince her to come back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you be convinced, if you had decided to leave?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis always managed to echo his own thoughts back to him. “I never would have decided to leave Annerose,” Reinhard said. Unspoken and bitter was the understanding that Reinhard would have spirited her away, given any fraction of a chance. But he had been a ten year old child when she was taken from him, and now all the power in the universe couldn’t rescue her from the Kaiser’s web. Not alive, anyway. “But no,” Reinhard said finally, answering Kircheis’s question. “I wouldn’t change my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a brave thing, for a woman to leave her family like that,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Together, they watched the action on the bridge, the navigator standing to alert the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span>’s captain that the merchant ship had appeared on their sensors. Captain Steinmetz looked towards Reinhard for permission to hail the ship, and Reinhard gave it, dropping the privacy shield around the command dais so that he could listen to what the captain said. It was quite amusing to listen to him very carefully phrase the hail to the merchant vessel in such a way that it implied, but did not state, that Reinhard and the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span> were on His Majesty’s fleet business and requiring the merchant ship to come to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merchant vessel </span>
  <em>
    <span>Swan Lake</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Captain Steinmetz said. “This is Captain Steinmetz of the fleet vessel </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span>, under the command of His Excellency Admiral Lohengramm. Halt and come to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship came to a stop relative to the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and there was a long and tedious radio conversation that followed, during which Captain Steinmetz explained Reinhard’s urgent need to speak with two of the passengers. Reinhard had one of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span>’s shuttles sent over to retrieve Sybil and Tom, but they refused to leave the merchant ship and board the shuttle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard got on the radio himself, then. “Lady Sybil, you have my word that I have no intention of kidnapping you. You may return to the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Swan Lake </span>
  </em>
  <span>if you choose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There must have been enough sincerity in Reinhard’s voice that Sybil was convinced, and she and Tom took the shuttle to the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span> without much further argument. There wasn’t much that they could say over the radio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard did not greet Sybil and Tom in the landing area, but sent Kircheis to do so, and to bring them his personal quarters to speak. When Sybil finally arrived, her eyes were wide, and she was craning her neck to look at every detail of Reinhard’s ship. The man following behind her, Tom, was far less impressed, and his shoulders were hunched in a defensive, suspicious way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil, I did say that you could have a tour of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span>, didn’t I?” Reinhard asked, mildly amused as she entered his quarters. His suite was spacious and elegant, more akin to the Grantham house on Odin than it was to the flat he shared with Kircheis. There were couches set before a large plate window, one that looked out over the shining aft of the ship. Out the window, the dark and clumsy bulk of the merchant freighter </span>
  <em>
    <span>Swan Lake</span>
  </em>
  <span> could be clearly seen. Reinhard had chosen to talk in his quarters for this reason: it would certainly relax Sybil and Tom to know that their passage to Phezzan was not slipping away as they spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom’s eyes settled on the ship out the window as he walked in, and, though he didn’t unclench his jaw, he met Reinhard’s eyes with more of a look of respect than the bitter squint he had been wearing when he first entered the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil smiled at Reihard’s comment. “You did say that,” she said. “The universe must have a funny way of making you keep your promises.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard walked over to greet them. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Herr Branson.” Reinhard offered his hand. Tom hesitated for a moment before shaking it, but he did after a glance at Sybil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure it’s an honor for me, Count Lohengramm,” Tom said, only a hint of bitter humor in his voice. “Lady Sybil’s confidence that you would not break your word and have me arrested speaks highly of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard inclined his head, then released Tom’s hand. “Being known as a man who keeps his word is worth more than any title. Please, sit.” He gestured at the couches, Kircheis already taking a seat on one. “I don’t want to waste anyone’s time: merchant ships have their schedules, and I have business on Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil and Tom sat down next to each other on one couch, and Reinhard settled next to Kircheis. He studied the way they sat: close, not touching, but still taking some kind of comfort from the presence of the other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume my father sent you here to fetch me back,” Sybil said after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is what we are here to do, though it was your cousin who asked this favor of me. I believe your father doesn’t want much to do with me or my staff, at the moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil frowned, but smoothed the expression over. “I’m sorry that Cousin Matthew has made you go out of your way. There was no need.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil,” Kircheis said, “your family only wants the best for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This unexpectedly touched a nerve. “My family does not know what that is,” Sybil said. “My father’s idea of a person’s best interests sometimes happens to look startlingly like his own.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis offered her a gentle smile. “I understand. But your family asked Lord Reinhard to find you because they were terrified that the worst had happened.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what is the worst that they thought might have happened, Captain Kircheis?” Tom asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think anyone needs to hear harsh words, which we might have, if any of your family had come to convince you to return home,” Kircheis said. “Their concern is genuine, and that’s all that needs to be said.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can tell them that I’m in no danger, from Tom or from anything else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think that’s true,” Reinhard said. “You are very lucky that your noble privilege and your family on Phezzan have made it so that you were able to flee the country without attracting attention. You’re lucky indeed that your cousin was able to forestall your father contacting the police. He might yet, if I don’t bring you back with me. I don’t think you need me to explain how dangerous that is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But we would be safe on Phezzan--” Sybil began, looking at Tom for confirmation. He nodded, with much more confidence in the motion than he deserved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps,” Reinhard said. “It’s not likely that you are valued highly enough that resources would be expended to catch you. But even if you weren’t chased to Phezzan, if the police were on the lookout for you, you would not be allowed to return home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need to go back to Odin,” Tom said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Sybil’s face was drawn. “Never?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not until the world changes,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil hasn’t done anything wrong,” Tom said. “Even if I had to stay, she could go back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s fled the country in the company of someone implicated in terrorism,” Reinhard said. When Tom opened his mouth to protest, Reinhard held up his hand. “Please do not waste my time by lying, Herr Branson. Even if I did not know the truth-- the truth, or even the presumption of innocence and a necessity to prove guilt, has ever been a high priority of His Majesty’s secret police.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is going to happen?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you return to Odin with me on board the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span>, likely nothing. If you go to Phezzan and live with your family there, and cause no trouble that would be noticed by the Imperial Embassy, maybe you would be able to return home. If you cannot do that--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what about Tom?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are associated with him,” Kircheis said. “Anything that he is seen doing may end up reflecting on you, just as his associations on Odin reflected on your family.” As Kircheis said this, Tom looked straight ahead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I ask what you were intending to do, upon reaching Phezzan?” Reinhard asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pair of runaways looked at each other. “We were going to figure that out once we got there,” Sybil said. “I think it will depend on what my grandmama says. If she’d let me stay with her, that would be the easiest thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Herr Branson?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t want to leave Lady Sybil,” he said. The tone in his voice was odd. “I have a responsibility for dragging her halfway across the galaxy.” Sybil looked at him and smiled, which cracked his stony expression, at least momentarily. “But I doubt Mrs. Levinson would be happy with me coming by,” he said. “Or with Lady Sybil’s choices, generally.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She might be,” Sybil said. “She’s--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phezzani?” Kircheis offered with a particular amused tone and tilt of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Sybil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That may be so,” Reinhard said. “But if your mother is crying out for her daughter to return home, I doubt your grandmother would be willing to keep you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t go back until I decide to, regardless of what my family thinks,” Sybil said, stiff and assured. “They can come to Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They might,” Kircheis said. “And what will you tell them about running away with a servant?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked at Tom, flushed, and looked away. “They don’t need me to tell them anything. Tom is a free man. He can travel to Phezzan if he wishes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil,” Kircheis said, gently, “I understand how you feel. But--” In a startling moment, Kircheis broke off and looked away. Reinhard gave him a sharp glance, concerned. Kircheis, feeling his gaze, elaborated. “I, too, followed someone away from my family. Because of that, I have seen my parents just once, in nine years. I understand why you feel the way you do, but the harder you push your parents away…” He looked back at Sybil. “They do love you, in their way.” But then he hardened his voice, and his gaze flicked to Reinhard. “But you make the choices you can live with, for yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard smiled back, but to take the pressure off of Kircheis in his confessional moment, he turned to Tom. “And you, Herr Branson, what do you intend to do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s difficult to answer that question in a place like this,” he said, his glance around encompassing all of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Brunhilde</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Reinhard and Kircheis in their uniforms, and even Lady Sybil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then let me give you a word of advice,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please.” Though he didn’t sound like he wanted it in the least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard’s voice was cold and hard. “Remain on Phezzan,” he said. “You may think you will find kindred spirits in the rebel territories, but don’t be naive and blindly chase them. It will be safer for you to stay on Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Sybil asked, leaning forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The only reason that the rebel territories continue to exist is that no one within the Empire has had the will to commit to destroying them,” Reinhard said. “And, besides that, their government is grossly mismanaged.” He looked directly at Tom. “You won’t find a brilliant cadre of utopian socialists. You’ll find a shambling bureaucracy that is only holding itself up through inertia. When they’re pressed hard enough, they’ll crumble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom had tensed in barely restrained anger during this pronouncement, but Sybil spoke next. “And you think that Phezzan will be safe?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phezzan is valuable,” Reinhard said, voice clipped. “I don’t think its government-- whatever little of it there is-- is worth much, but its position in the corridor is, as is the amount of control it exerts on the galaxy’s finances. People will go to great lengths to make sure all of that remains intact, no matter what comes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s easy for someone with noble privilege and the Kaiser’s favor to say that a government that wouldn’t give you those things is a failure,” Tom said, still hung up on Reinhard’s dismissal of the Free Planets Alliance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Branson--” Kircheis began, but Reinhard held up his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Noble privilege?” Reinhard asked. Annerose’s face flashed to the forefront of his mind. He bit back everything he might have said. There was no sense in telling Tom that he would have run to the Free Planets Alliance himself if he could have to save Annerose, and he had no desire to explain Annerose’s suffering to someone who did not want to understand it. “Everything I have has been more than paid for,” Reinhard said. “And I despise any system which allows power to collect in the hands of those who are not fit to carry it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you don’t hate having power over others, do you?” Tom asked, unable to let go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom,” Sybil said, but he ignored her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s human nature, Herr Branson. Humanity will always require leadership-- but the leaders must have the strength to lead, not just the charm to get elected, or the fortune of being born someone’s son.” He looked at Tom and offered an olive branch. “But perhaps Ale Heinessen will be vindicated in the end: the Goldenbaum dynasty will not last forever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do you think will replace it?” Tom asked. He was still bitter, but there was a hint of genuine curiosity in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a difficult question to answer in a place like this,” Reinhard said, repeating Tom’s words back to him. “But the times are changing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you’re right,” Sybil said. Reinhard just inclined his head at her. Her father’s alliance with Duke Braunschweig made it difficult for her wishes to be genuine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kaiser Rudolph also changed the universe,” Tom pointed out. “Forgive me for hoping that whatever change comes will be for the better, rather than for the worse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you want to shape the Empire in your image, you should stay there and do it,” Reinhard said. “I’ll happily take you back to Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I’ll end up dead, and it will never concern you again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no more love in my heart for the military police and their duties than you do, I can assure you,” Reinhard said. “But if you do not want to return to Odin, then very well. I wish you the best of luck on Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or in the Free Planets Alliance,” Tom said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you like,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Sybil frowned. “Do you really want to go there so badly?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can figure it out on the way.” He looked at Reinhard and Kircheis, and Sybil was forced to nod. “Either way, we’re going to Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can’t convince you to return home to your family?” Kircheis asked Sybil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid you haven’t tried too hard, Captain Kircheis,” Sybil said. “But even if you had… no.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard just nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil reached inside the pocket of her dress, hesitated, then pulled out an envelope. She handed it to Reinhard, who took it. The envelope was addressed in Sybil’s gracious script. “That’s for my family,” she said. “I wrote it before I left, but then I thought if anyone found it, they might try to stop me from leaving. Could you give it to them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think your cousin will be the one to ultimately deliver it,” Reinhard said. “But I’ll make sure it ends up in his hands.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A hint of a frown passed over Sybil’s face. “I hope my mother and sisters aren’t already on the way home before you get back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This letter says things you want them to remember you by?” Kircheis asked. He took the envelope out of Reinhard’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil opened her mouth, closed it again, then nodded. Kircheis smiled and put the letter down on the coffee table. “I suppose I won’t see them for a long time,” she said, very melancholy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nobody knows the future,” Kircheis said. “The civil war may be over sooner than you think, and after that, you may be able to return to Odin without fear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long do you think it will be?” Sybil asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Kircheis admitted. “But I’m looking forward to that day, I’m sure as much as you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom’s brow furrowed. “What exactly are you looking forward to, Captain Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis’s smile was placid. “The same thing Lady Sybil is: returning home to the people I love.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a bittersweet pronouncement: there was the admission that they would be living apart for some time, but after the civil war, Annerose would be free, and the three of them could live together. Reinhard pushed the fantasy out of his mind, keeping his eyes on the pair before him. Indulging in that kind of fantasy was best suited for when he and Kircheis were alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I doubt there will be a season again until then,” Sybil said. “I suppose I’m in no rush to return to Odin, at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There will likely never be a season like this again,” Reinhard said. “I think the old ways are done. And that’s for the better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil’s face twisted. “Is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seem to have more love for the nobility that I do,” Reinhard said, casting an amused look at Tom, who scowled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I--” She hesitated for a second. “It’s just the only world I’ve ever known.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t make it a good one,” Reinhard pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil was silent for a moment, then said, “That’s true.” She steeled herself. “I am going to Phezzan, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if we have done our due diligence in trying to convince you to return to Odin today, and have failed, then we shouldn’t hold the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Swan Lake</span>
  </em>
  <span> from her course any longer,” Reinhard said, looking out the window at the waiting merchant vessel. He stood. Everyone else followed him up. He offered his hand to Tom, who shook it again. “I don’t have many connections on Phezzan that I can offer to aid you with,” Reinhard admitted. He was tempted to tell Tom of the deserter that he knew in the rebel territories, but he decided that he likely would have changed his name and been impossible to find. “But if we find ourselves in the same place again--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Tom said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil, I hope you find what you’re looking for on Phezzan,” Reinhard said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will,” she said. “Thank you for not dragging me back to my family by force.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not that kind of man, though your family might like me better if I was.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Sybil said. “Count Lohengramm--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard cocked his head at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You stay safe, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard just laughed. “I don’t think I need to worry,” he said. “Kircheis makes sure of that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sybil looked at Kircheis, who smiles, his eyes crinkling up. “I hope you’re right,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have a safe trip to Phezzan, Lady Sybil,” Kircheis said.  </span>

  <span>Carson made the announcement at breakfast, the second day after the ransacking of the house. He stood at the front of the table, addressing the exhausted and harried staff with the scowl that had become a permanent fixture on his face. Thomas was annoyed at the prospect of his breakfast being delayed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you are no doubt aware,” Carson began, his gaze sweeping over the staff, “Lord Grantham is very concerned about the political stability of Odin in the near future, and so he has arranged for the family to return home prior to the expected end of the season. Lord Grantham is aware that this change is in violation of the spirit in which the majority of you were hired, as you were all expecting to work the full season.” There were some nods of assent around the table. Thomas had been thinking about that a great deal, ever since he had learned that the family was leaving, but he had not had the space to take a moment for himself to consider his possibilities, let alone act on them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As a matter of </span>
  <em>
    <span>great</span>
  </em>
  <span> generosity,” Carson continued, “Lord Grantham has decided that, for just this one time, any of the Odin seasonal staff who wish it will be given passage with the family out of the capital.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were a few surprised sounds from the table, but Thomas couldn’t tell if they were sounds of relief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about people who don’t want to leave, Herr Carson?” Daisy asked. She was standing in the entrance to the kitchen, wiping her hands vainly on her apron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any who remain on Odin will be given a month’s wages and a letter of reference,” Carson said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And those who go? Will there be work in the family’s house?” William asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not for everyone,” Carson said. “But there is work elsewhere, and Lord Grantham will ensure that you find it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why’s he doing this?” Daisy asked. “I thought he’d not care, since one of us brought the police here, and all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carson turned the full force of his withering glare on her. “Lord Grantham is a generous man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the very least, he was a man who didn’t like to feel he was sending his staff to the slaughter, Thomas thought. He clenched his gloved hand beneath the table. When he had received his summons to the fleet, Lord Grantham would have written him an exemption letter without a second thought. It was only Thomas who hadn’t wanted to take it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked around at the rest of the staff, all mulling over this possibility: leave behind the metropolis that was the only place they had ever known, their families, their lives, go into voluntary exile, all just for the chance to avoid whatever terror was coming. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas’s thoughts were sluggish-- too many ideas were trying to coexist at once, and they jammed themselves up together and refused to slip free into a conclusion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have a few days to decide,” Carson finally said, after all the mumbles had subsided. “His Lordship has chartered a ship, but it won’t be in port until next week. I advise any of you who are going to settle your affairs.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, with that, he headed out. Thomas bent his head down to eat his breakfast, ignoring everybody else.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>Though there were a few staff who had initially gone with the family to take care of their immediate needs during their stay in the city at Lady Rosamund’s house, they reappeared later that day to do some packing. This included Tom, who stayed well out of everyone’s way, though he nodded at Thomas when they passed each other in the hallway; and O’brien, who packed up the remainder of Lady Grantham’s personal belongings as swiftly as she could, and then focused on her own room. Bates, strangely, was nowhere to be seen, though Thomas couldn’t say he minded in the least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door between the women’s and men’s sides of the servants hallway in the attic was propped open, to allow people to carry suitcases and things up and down the stairway more easily. This meant that it was easy for Thomas to lean on O’brien’s door as she folded her few outfits into the carpetbag she used every year to pack her whole life up and move between Odin and the Grantham family’s ancestral home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should I even ask if you’re going to do the sensible thing and get off Odin with the rest of us?” O’brien asked as Thomas darkened her doorstep. After just a glance at him, she turned her attention back to folding the dresses hanging in her closet, laying them out on her thin bed one by one and tucking them up to go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s it to you?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t matter to me one bit,” O’brien said. “But you’ve never been known to make a smart choice when a foolish one would do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t made up my mind,” Thomas said. In his pocket, his thumb stretched and worried at his leather glove. “I paid a lot to get to Odin in the first place. Seems like a shame to leave so soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s not going to be anything good to keep you here,” she cautioned. “One month’s wages isn’t going to get you far, not when you don’t have a place to live.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I like Odin,” Thomas said. “And maybe I do have something to keep me here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>O’brien did not take the bait. “Ruin your life, then. I can’t be bothered to stop you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’s Bates?” Thomas asked. “I figured he’d come back with you to pack Lord Grantham’s things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>O’brien jerked her head at the door, and Thomas craned his neck to look down both ends of the hallway, making sure they were alone, then nodded at her. “Lord Grantham is staying on Odin,” she said. “That’s privileged information, though. The girls don’t know it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas raised his eyebrows. “What for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s going to get himself killed in some war, since he regrets missing his chance when he was fighting against the rebels,” O’brien said. “But what do I know about that!” She finished folding her dress and stuffed it inside her bag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t seem thrilled.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Her Ladyship is unhappy, it makes my job harder.” She turned to grab the next dress from the closet. “You should come back. Bates will be staying with His Lordship, so you wouldn’t have any problems with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I’d have a job in the house? That didn’t seem like a guarantee.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re home staff, aren’t you?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like to be assured of that before I sign my life away on a ticket back there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do what you like,” O’brien said. “I don’t care.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>What Thomas really wanted was to see the Duke of Crowsburg. After the first time they met in the hotel, the duke had given him his phone number so that he could let Thomas know if he was going to be in the capital, and so Thomas was able to text him, asking if they could meet. It took a few hours for the duke to respond. Thomas tried not to be impatient and nervous about the delay-- the duke was a busy man-- but it wore him down regardless. When the response came, saying that the duke would be in his same hotel room tomorrow night, and that Thomas was welcome to come at some late hour, the relief could have knocked him off his feet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He floated, distracted, through the rest of the day and the next. When Carson asked if he had given any thought to leaving with the family, Thomas just mumbled that he had been thinking about it and he would get an answer to Carson as soon as he had made up his mind. Carson glared at him but let him go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With the family out of the house, it was almost too easy to get dressed and slip out into the cold night. It was a long, dreary walk to town and the train, but at least it wasn’t raining. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was jarred by how lively the capital city was. Music was spilling out of open restaurant doors, and people dressed to the nines were wandering arm in arm down the brightly lit streets. The past few days had left Thomas feeling like the normal world had crumbled and vanished along with the Grantham family’s sense of safety, but here was everyone else, dancing and laughing and pretending that the world wasn’t going to end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas couldn’t put a finger on why he felt this disconnect so strongly. Was he truly that alarmed at the prospect of civil war coming to Odin? His hands were deep in his coat pockets, curled into fists. It wasn’t as though he would be called back up to fight in it, and all the nobles would want to keep the battle in space, he was sure. After all, what good was fighting over the throne if the capital ended up a smoking wreck?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Picturing the lively streets of the city in flames was doing nothing to improve his mood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, he didn’t think that there would be too much danger here. Lord Grantham was being paranoid. Thomas’s real trouble was that he did not want to go back to the same dreary life he had worked so hard to get away from, especially if he had no guarantee of employment. Being on Odin, no matter what came, would be better than that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he was clinging to a lifeline, the idea of getting away from it all with Philip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned the corner, and the hotel came into view: columns, pillars, steps in white marble, glowing faintly in the chill air beneath the streetlights. Thomas entered the lobby and found someone to follow up the elevator. Pretending like he belonged was easy enough-- he was sure he looked just as distracted as all the suited businessmen walking through the lobby. No one paid him any mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The top floor hallway was eerily empty, and Thomas felt like anyone standing around the corner would have been able to hear his breathing in the strange silence. His feet made almost no sound on the plush red-carpeted floor. Knocking on Philip’s door rang in his ears, though the anechoic hallway swallowed and dampened the sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a moment for Philip to open the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas,” he said, smiling. He didn’t pull on Thomas’s sleeve urgently as he had the last time Thomas had come, but his voice was still warm, and that assuaged Thomas’s nerves plenty. He was still in his day clothes, though just shirtsleeves, no jacket, and his silk necktie had been abandoned on the countertop that cordoned off the kitchen area from the rest of the space.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you glad to see me?” Thomas asked, as soon as the door was shut.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip just looked him over for a second, his eyes traveling the length of Thomas’s body. Thomas shrugged off his coat to make that easier, resorting to draping it over the back of the couch when he didn’t see a coat closet or hook immediately to hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m surprised you were able to get away,” Philip said after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should have told me you were staying in the capital.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you would be busy. I heard the Granthams are getting ready to go back to their country estate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>They</span>
  </em>
  <span> are,” Thomas said. “Or, at least Lady Grantham and her daughters are. Lord Grantham fancies himself a soldier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The expression that flitted across Philip’s face was one of unrestrained, rather horrified, surprise-- eyes widening and lips parting-- but he covered it up as quickly as it had come with a smile. This one didn’t reach his eyes. “I wish him luck, then,” Philip said. “Things must be serious, if even the older generation are coming out of retirement.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s made it easier to get out to the city tonight, anyway,” Thomas said. “The family is staying with Lady Painswick while the staff pack the house.” He shrugged. “I can stay late, if you like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip’s smile curled. “Well, that is an enticing offer.” He turned away from Thomas and walked a little ways back into the hotel suite, asking over his shoulder, “Have you eaten?” He gestured at a few pastries on a covered tray: fruit tarts and chocolate dainties.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I had dinner,” Thomas said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wine?” Philip asked, retrieving a bottle from the small wine fridge tucked under the counter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re trying to spoil me.” Thomas slipped around behind Philip and embraced him, his hands on Philip’s waist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I be blamed for that?” Philip chuckled at the feeling of Thomas’s fingers traipsing across his stomach, but continued to pull down glasses from the shelf and uncork the wine bottle, pouring with a steadiness that even Carson would have envied as Thomas nuzzled his exposed neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He managed to turn around holding the two glasses of wine, though Thomas had him pinned against the counter. Thomas reluctantly removed his hand from Philip’s waist to take the offered glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To the end of an Odin season,” Philip said. “And to living to see another.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Prosit,” Thomas said. The wine sparkled in the glasses as he and Philip drank, and it coated his mouth, rich and bitter. He finished his glass quickly, mostly so that he could watch Philip drink his. Philip met his eyes, but Thomas couldn’t read his expression, half hidden by the wine glass as it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Philip finished his drink, Thomas stopped him from putting it down or reaching behind himself with the bottle, covering Philip’s hand with his own to take the glass from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am glad you asked to see me,” Philip said after Thomas put both of their glasses down on the countertop. He leaned back against it, half-smiling, his eyes in warm shadow as he looked up at Thomas. Thomas brushed his right hand across Philip’s cheek, cradling the back of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Thomas said, and he leaned in to kiss Philip. He was yielding, and leaned back against the countertop as Thomas kissed him, tasting the wine on both their lips, his fingers catching on Philip’s silky hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would have been a shame to not see you before you left with the Granthams,” Philip murmured as Thomas kissed towards his jaw. “I will miss you.” He pulled Thomas’s hand away from his head and held it lightly. Thomas took the opportunity to lift it and kiss Philip’s fingers, one by one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have to go,” Thomas said, in between Philip’s knuckles. Philip made a noise that was almost a sigh, and brushed Thomas’s hair off his forehead with his free hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t recommend staying on Odin, if I were you,” Philip said. “I’m certainly not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could come with you to Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philip pressed a silencing finger to Thomas’s lips, but Thomas just kissed it, then opened his mouth slightly to let the finger fall on his teeth, dragging his lower lip down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As what, Thomas?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As your valet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need a valet,” Philip said. “Besides, you know how I’m fixed-- if I can’t find an heiress on Phezzan--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t tell me you wouldn’t still want this,” Thomas said. He could be convincing, lifting his eyes to meet Philip’s. Philip was looking away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not exactly the question,” Philip said. Thomas dropped his hand to kiss him again, though Philip reciprocated less, and when he turned his head, Thomas’s lips fluttered against the corner of his mouth, along his cheek. But he didn’t push Thomas away: he did still want him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what is?” Thomas asked. “I could work for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t really have the basis of a servant-master relationship. Do we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Neither do Count Lohengramm and his man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re dead men walking,” Philip said, which rather spoiled the mood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You said-- if something happened--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did I, Thomas?” the duke asked. His voice was gentle, and that made it much worse. “I don’t make promises that I can’t keep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When I walked into that party for you, if someone had found out--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing’s come of that,” Philip said. “I told you nothing would. I just can’t see it working out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wanted to see me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So that I could wish you well, since you’re going with the Grantham family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I want to be with you,” Thomas said. It was half a whine, the layers of happiness and hope that had buoyed him these past few days crumbling apart one by one. Already, he was cursing himself for not being smarter, for being too trusting, for not hardening his heart when he had the chance. But even now, Philip in front of him made him desperate, made him try to hold on and plead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a moment for Philip to respond, long enough that hope sang in Thomas’s chest that he had hit on the right combination of words. The hope was crushed as soon as the duke opened his mouth. “We’re just too different, you and I.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t seem like it to me.” He took a breath. “I though you felt the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was never going to last-- I’m only ever here for the season anyway.” He looked away. “And one swallow doesn’t make a summer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas pulled himself away from the duke. The feeling in his chest had collapsed into anger, white hot. “You shouldn’t think yourself too different from me,” Thomas said, stepping back and straightening his shirt. “After all-- the same things can happen to us both.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you threatening me?” the duke asked. He sounded almost amused. “Come now, Thomas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have evidence.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie’s photograph?” the duke asked. He didn’t sound surprised, merely disappointed. Thomas should have expected he’d know about that, but it still stung. “You’d risk your own ruin over this? A few weeks of madness in an Odin season?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would if I had to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No one would believe a greedy footman over the words of a duke.” He turned away from Thomas and poured two more glasses of wine. “My mother’s always telling me to never let myself be photographed,” he said. “I suppose I should try to learn that lesson.” He turned back around and held out one of the glasses of wine to Thomas. “And besides, I’m going to Phezzan. By the time I get back--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas just stared at the glass of wine held out to him. Philip took a sip of his own, held in his other hand. It glittered in the dim light, ruby red. Without thinking much of anything, Thomas reached for it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll stay the night, wish me well, and we can part as friends? Won’t that be better, Thomas?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a single flick of his wrist, Thomas threw his wine directly onto the duke’s face. It dripped down his nose, beaded on his lips, parted in shock, barely missed his eyes that he had closed just in time. It stained his shirt blood red. He just stood there in shock for a second, opening his mouth and taking a deep breath of surprise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas suddenly processed exactly what he had just done. He dropped his now empty glass onto the counter, and, with as much dignity as he could muster, straightened his shirt, grabbed his jacket, and stomped out of the duke’s hotel room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He made it about two blocks before the shock, cold, and sadness overcame him. Before his facade crumpled completely, he ducked into an alley and he leaned on a brick wall in between some trash cans, putting his face into his elbow, and breaking out into great, sniffling sobs that were witnessed only by the two tomcats hissing and spitting at each other down near the end of the street.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Thomas finally arrived back at the Grantham residence, he was shocked and horrified to find that the house was not quiet and serene as he had been expecting, but every light was on, and through the windows, he could see people rushing about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas tried to sneak in through the back door, but when he entered the servants’ hall, he was spotted by Daisy, hanging around the kitchen, who shrieked when she saw him like she’d seen a ghost, dropping the rag she had been using to wipe down the already clean counters with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thomas! Everybody’s been looking for you!” she yelped, after she had gotten herself under control.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Thomas asked, confused and lethargic. He was freezing, and though the cold walk home had numbed some of the pain of his encounter with the duke, it had done it mostly by slowing his thoughts down to a sluggish crawl. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Sybil is missing! Everyone thought you were, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Missing from Lady Painswick’s house?” Thomas asked. Daisy nodded. Thomas knew exactly what that was about, and the warmth of the kitchen and the urgency on Daisy’s face was thawing his thoughts enough that anger bubbled to the surface again. “It’s got nothing to do with me,” he said, and turned away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, go tell that to Herr Carson before he tells the police that you’re gone, too!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas trudged up the stairs. He knew, or he thought he knew, why Daisy was in a panic about staff being missing. Tom Branson was sure to be vanished, as well. He bit the side of his tongue as he went to find Carson. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, Tom and Lady Sybil could run away to Phezzan together! How lucky for them!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The jealousy swelled until he saw Carson standing in the entrance hall, looking out the front window, his face red, his hand over his chest like he was in pain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Carson,” Thomas said. “I heard you were looking for me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was surprised that Carson didn’t have a heart attack right then and there. His expression shifted between shock and apoletic anger, and his voice came out as somewhere in a mixture of the two. “Where on Odin have you been?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had some business in the city,” Thomas said. “I didn’t think I would be needed after dinner, since the family’s gone and all…” He trailed off into mumbles under the force of Carson’s glare. The mundanity of being caught taking unexcused time off was at least a problem Thomas knew how to deal with, and he was grateful that everything else going on would probably get him a pass. “I know I should have cleared it with you but I didn’t think it would matter…” His voice grew smaller and smaller.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lucky we hadn’t reported you missing,” Carson said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Daisy told me that Lady Sybil is gone?” Thomas asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Tom Branson with her, unless he, too, is just out for a night on the town,” Carson said. “We’re making a search of the house just to be sure there’s no one else gone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Carson--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Thomas?” he growled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You might want to call Herr Matthew von Crawley,” Thomas said. “If His Lordship hasn’t already. He might know where Lady Sybil’s gone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why would you think he knows that?” Carson asked, giving Thomas a decidedly deadly glare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve seen them talk,” Thomas said. “They’re close, is all. Maybe she’s just gone to his house to say goodbye.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for your input, Thomas. </span>
  <em>
    <span>That</span>
  </em>
  <span> will be </span>
  <em>
    <span>all.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Unless you have some other pressing information that you’d like to divulge?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir,” Thomas said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t seem like Thomas was going to be listened to. Carson was sufficiently distracted that he did not notice that when Thomas slipped away, he headed back down towards the servants’ hall, and then to Carson’s office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom wouldn’t have appreciated what Thomas was doing, not in the least, but Thomas didn’t care. He opened Carson’s office, stepped inside, closed the door behind himself, and looked around. There, beneath the phone installed in the office wall, sitting on Carson’s desk, was the address book that contained every number for the running of the household: vendors, repairmen, important guests who might need to be issued invitations. Thomas flipped through it, running his finger down the columns, until he came to Matthew von Crawley’s name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He read the number, then dialed it from the office line. It took several rings for Matthew to pick up, and when he did, he sounded annoyed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello?” Matthew asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Crawley, this is Thomas Barrow, I work in Lord Grantham’s--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know who you are, Thomas,” Matthew said. His tone changed, less annoyed, more confused. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should know that Lady Sybil is missing,” Thomas said. “She’s gone with another one of the servants to Phezzan, I think. You’ll have to tell Lord Grantham that’s what’s happened, since you have a reason to know about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence from the end of the line. “Thank you, Thomas. I appreciate it.” And, with that, Matthew hung up.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the confusion that followed, rumors circulated among the staff about what had happened: Lady Sybil and Tom had been arrested by the military police; Tom had kidnapped her to use for ransom money; Lady Sybil had simply been trying to go drive to a party, and Tom had accidentally driven them both off a cliff and no one had identified the bodies; both of them had been taken by terrorists; and ever-wilder combinations of these ideas, and more. Carson and Frau Hughes tried to stamp this out as best they could, but the talk continued unabated. Thomas tried to stay out of it. He was still on Carson’s bad side for slipping out, though no one had yet pressed him about that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite the chaos, there was one thing that could not change: the family’s departure date from Odin. Lord Grantham had booked his ship, and there would be no changing its schedule by more than a few hours-- it was simply too expensive. Thomas had avoided making up his mind about leaving until now, but with the departure looming, he had to make up his mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He packed his bags, since he figured he would be sent out of the house regardless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the day of the departure, when the whole staff was running about with the frantic, last-minute pre-departure panic, Lord Grantham and Matthew Crawley returned to the estate. The rest of the family was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps they had already boarded the ship that would be taking them home-- Thomas didn’t know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was loitering in the hall, standing in front of a few boxes of possessions, waiting for a car to come around so that he could load them in, when Lord Grantham and Matthew entered. They didn’t spare him a glance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This place will feel so empty without the rest of your family in it, won’t it?” Matthew said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure it will,” Lord Grantham said. “It would have even if Cora and Mary and Edith were staying.” He ran his hand over his face, and Thomas could see just how drawn he looked, how much Sybil’s going had aged him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’ll be safe on Phezzan,” Matthew said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not a matter of safety,” Lord Grantham snapped. But then he sighed. “Forgive me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand,” Matthew said. “I wish there was something more I could have done--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you did what you could.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Matthew looked around the hall, seeing the family’s crests hung, the beautiful sweeping lines of the ceiling, taking it all in like he never had before. Perhaps he was just looking for something to look at other than Lord Grantham, who was weary and sad. “It will be strange to live here,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want you to know at least this part of the estate, even if I couldn’t convince you to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate it,” Matthew said. “I can’t pack up my whole life, but…” He turned on his toes, looking around the whole room. “I do want to understand how to be the right heir for this place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Lord Grantham said. “I expect I’ll probably rely on you, once things get busy. I won’t have as much time to dedicate to the estate as I should” That was a pleasant way of putting things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Matthew’s roving eyes landed on Thomas, standing over by the boxes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Thomas--” Matthew said. Lord Grantham looked at him, confused. Matthew explained, “Thomas was the one who thought to let me know that Lady Sybil was missing.” He turned back to Thomas. “Thank you, for that. I really appreciated it. And I’m glad I got to see you before you went.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a problem, sir,” Thomas said. “I’m sorry that there wasn’t more that I could do for Lady Sybil, or Your Lordship.” He nodded at Lord Grantham.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, thank you, Thomas,” Lord Grantham said, though he still seemed a little confused. It didn’t matter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going home with the family?” Matthew asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas spied an opportunity, one that had just landed at his feet. “I was wondering, Your Lordship, sir, if I might stay on as staff here? If you’re planning to live here, and Herr Carson is going with Lady Grantham and the rest of the family, won’t you need someone to look after things here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t be doing much entertaining,” Lord Grantham said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s only that I don’t really want to leave Odin, and especially if Herr Crawley is going to be here, Herr Carson probably wouldn’t want to leave you with no staff at all, aside from Herr Bates, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you spoken to Carson about this?” Lord Grantham asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Thomas said. “I just had the thought.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, tell him to speak to me about it.” He glanced at his watch. “Quickly, since he’ll need to board the ship in a couple of hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Your Lordship,” Thomas said. </span>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>i realized while writing this chapter that honestly, it would work better as the penultimate chapter rather than the final one. probably in a week or so after everybody who's been following this story has had a chance to read it (so that no one gets confused) i'm going to switch this chapter with the previous reinhard one.</p><p>there wasn't a physical object for thomas and the duke to wrestle over, so i settled for doing something else. when i started writing this chapter, i didn't have thomas dumping the wine all over the duke in mind, but when i got to it i was like "oh, i've set this up so perfectly to mirror the moment when they met, I can't NOT include it" haha</p><p>philip is, sadly, kinda a dick</p><p>but hey, at least thomas gets a promotion to like, substitute butler while carson flies away! that's good for him.</p><p>proceed directly to the next chapter / do not pass go / do not collect $200<br/>(or don't) it's the epilogue. but i think it's a fun little snippet that's worth reading :) and i will likely have some further author's notes there talking about the story as a whole so lol. might as well.</p></blockquote>

  <p>
  <span>Hildegarde von Mariendorf, the only child of Count Franz von Mariendorf, was dressed in a light blue men’s suit when she came calling on Count Grantham. Her short-cropped blonde hair curled lightly around her ears, and she smiled up at the bright spring weather as she waited outside the door to be let in. Someone did, a moment after she rang the bell: a tall, handsome man, who asked what business she was calling on. She explained it, and he led her to the richly decorated library, waiting for Count Grantham.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Count Grantham appeared a moment later, and the servant who had let her in stood in the corner of the library. She could feel that he was watching her, even though his expression was neutral and his eyes stared blankly ahead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fraulein Mariendorf,” Count Grantham said as he came in, “to what do I owe the honor of your visit?” His expression when he looked her over was decidedly not neutral, and in fact seemed highly scandalized by her outfit, but he at least kept it out of her voice. “I haven’t seen you in years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I’ve come on business, Count Grantham,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gestured at one of the couches, and she sat, crossing her legs and smiling at him. He sat down across from her. He was dressed in his uniform, a vice admiral’s stripes upon his shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what sort of business is it? I’m not sure what I can help you with.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde folded her hands on her lap. “I won’t waste your time,” she said. “In plain terms, I’ve come to ask you to reconsider your alliance with Duke Braunschweg, and consider allying yourself with Count Lohengramm, to support Erwin Josef for the throne.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham couldn’t keep the surprise off his face. “You always were a direct young woman,” he said. “I wasn’t aware that your father favored anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father favored Duke Braunschweig,” Hilde said. “But I convinced him to switch my family’s allegiance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Grantham leaned back in his seat in surprise. “I didn’t know your father to be that changeable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s not,” Hilde said. “But he’s a pragmatic man, and it has become as clear to him, as it always has been to me, that Duke Braunschweig is not the one who will be victorious in this battle, not even if he aligns himself with Marquis Littenheim against Count Lohengramm, which he is going to do, and soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because alone, either of them will fall to Count Lohengramm far too quickly,” she said. “He has the backing already of many minor families, and Secretary of State Lichtenlade is going to grant him authority to use much of the official forces against those they see as impeeding the correct line of succession.” She tilted her head. “After all, Erwin Josef, of all the three grandchildren, is the only boy, and the only son of Prince Ludwig.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m surprised that you find it so vital that we don’t have a Kaiserin on the throne.” It was a pointed remark.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde shook her head. “It’s not about the throne itself, it’s about who puts the future ruler there. If Count Lohengramm were supporting Elizabeth or Sabine, I would still support him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m willing to listen to you explain why, but I do not think you will be able to change my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Lohengramm is a military genius,” Hilde said. “Duke Braunschweig is not. Although he has attracted plenty of capable talent to his side, such as Admiral Merkatz and his supporting staff, Admiral Ovelesser, yourself, and others-- it’s clear that he is more swayed by political considerations than military ones. If Count Lohengramm, for example, decides to target the ancestral homes of one of Duke Braunschweig’s subordinates, even with a glancing blow, Duke Braunschweig would be forced to expend resources there, rather than protecting the capital. And while Duke Braunschweig is highly ranked, he has very little combat experience, unlike Count Lohengramm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I also have personal trust in Count Lohengramm to act fairly to those who work with him, and to make efficient use of the resources that my family is giving him. I would not trust Duke Braunschweig with the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope it’s not simply a coalition of youth,” Lord Grantham said after a moment. “I would not want to feel like I was destroying the Empire’s future by opposing him. If all of the rest of the young nobility feel as you do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde ignored the implied insult. “May I ask why you are supporting Duke Braunschweig?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Simply put, I trust him.” Lord Grantham ran his hands over the legs of his pants. “I trust him in a way that I find I cannot trust Count Lohengramm, or any of his staff, or anything he says.” He smiled a thin smile. “But I doubt I will be able to convince you, Fraulein Mariendorf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was told that you had been social with Count Lohengramm this past season,” Hilde said. “Is there a reason your opinion of him has fallen so far?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One of my daughters, Sybil, decided to make a terrible mistake and run away to Phezzan. Count Lohengramm offered to find her and bring her back home. But when he found her, he simply let her go again. And now my daughter is--” He shook his head. “Among other things. He is not a man who knows about what it means to need to protect your family,” he said. “And I’m afraid he is never going to learn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Hilde said. She hesitated, then decided she could try one last tactic, since she wasn’t likely to get anywhere through conventional means. “Count Grantham, if Lady Sybil was here now, do you think she would prefer you support Duke Braunschweig over Count Lohengramm?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The count’s face reddened. “She’s not here, is she?” He stood, and Hilde stood as well. “Thank you for coming by, Fraulein Mariendorf. I’m sure you have many other places to go today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do. Thank you for your time, Count Grantham.” She nodded at him, and Lord Grantham gestured for the servant standing at the door to escort her out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they were outside, before she started walking away, the servant said, “Lady Mariendorf--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes?” she asked, turning to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is Count Lohengramm really going to win?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked up at the old house, the darkened, empty windows, the clouds full of spring rain gathering quickly on the horizon. “Yes,” she said. “He is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” the servant said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled at him, but he just nodded and turned back inside, shutting the door behind him.</span>
