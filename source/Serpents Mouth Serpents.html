        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>If you didn't read <i>Keep the Home Fires (Burning)</i>, you probably should do that before you read this story.

  <p>
  <em>
    <span>December 486 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Hildegarde von Mariendorf’s only concession to women’s fashion was a pair of tiny gold earrings. Her suit was a dark, jewel blue, with ruffled lace at her throat and wrists. She clicked her heels together and stood at attention, looking at herself in the tall mirror, then decided there was nothing else that she could do to improve her appearance. She left her childhood bedroom and went downstairs, doing a familiar half-slide down the slick bannister, landing at the bottom with a light hop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father, Count Franz von Mariendorf, was already in the hall, and he stifled his indulgent smile. “Aren’t you getting a little old for that, my darling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she said. “Is Sieg here yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am,” Siegfried Kircheis said, appearing from her father’s library. He was dressed in his uniform, the formal sash doing as much as it could to hide the fact that he was merely a sub-lieutenant. His fluffy red hair, though it was ever resistant to being combed into any sort of shape, was still endearing as it curled around his ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope I haven’t kept you waiting,” she said, smiling up at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not long. I appreciate your invitation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel like Hank would have found some way to make you come if I hadn’t invited you,” Hilde said confidently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He just smiled at her, his eyes crinkling up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you ready to go?” her father asked, looking between the two of them. Although Hilde was excited to go out, her father’s tone was much more subdued and pensive, apprehensive about the party. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The three of them headed out to the car, though Hilde caught her father’s arm and let Kircheis go ahead of them. “You sound like you’re not ready.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled at her. “I’m not going to get moreso by standing around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is something wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” he said. “Do you remember the parties your mother used to host for New Year’s?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde remembered very little from the time when her mother had been alive. The shock of her death had closed that door of memory. “Yes,” Hilde lied. “I’m sure this one won’t compare at all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father laughed. “Please don’t insult Princess Amarie’s skills as a hostess to her face.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am capable of tact, you know,” Hilde said, and let go of his arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They made it to the car, where Sieg and the driver were already seated. It was about a twenty minute drive to the Braunschweig house, and during it, her father and Sieg talked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How has it been, working under the duke?” her father asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t see much of him,” Kircheis said. “It’s more that I’m working under Captain Leigh, and I enjoy that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He keeps you busy, I assume.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis smiled. “He tries his best not to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t had the chance to speak with him as much as I’d like recently. Is he doing well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t be the judge of that, sir.” After a second, he added, “Captain Leigh takes his responsibility towards me seriously. Even if he wasn’t doing well, he would try not to burden me with his troubles.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does he get enough sleep, at least?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably not,” Kircheis admitted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you wouldn’t be able to tell me what Duke Braunschweig has him actually doing, would you?” the count asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde’s father just nodded and looked out the window. “I’m sorry to keep pestering you with questions, but Rear Admiral Reuenthal isn’t on Odin, is he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He just left, sir,” Kircheis said. “Some time last week, I believe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah. I would have hoped to see more of him, but he’s always been a mysterious man. Do you know him, Sub-lieutenant?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve met,” Kircheis said, an uncomfortable tone in his voice. “But nothing more than that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde looked over at him, curious about what was making Kircheis uncomfortable with Reuenthal. “You don’t like him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t like me, Fraulein.” Kircheis smiled, but it was stiff, and he fiddled with his uniform sash, straightening it out underneath the seatbelt. “I eavesdropped on one of his conversations, by accident. I doubt he’ll ever forgive me for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde laughed. “I’m sure it’s not that bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was bad enough that Captain Leigh asked for me to be placed with him when I graduated, rather than sending me to the rear admiral, as he had originally intended. He apologized for stifling my career, in that way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure he only did it because he wanted to have you in his staff,” Hilde pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis shrugged and fell silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral Reuenthal can be a difficult man to know,” her father said. “Don’t blame yourself for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since Kircheis couldn’t fill the silence of the car with anything of substance, he asked, “How are things at the Colonial Affairs office?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father heaved a sigh, a rare expression of frustration. “Worse every year,” he said. “I don’t think they’re going to get better any time soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Things have always been tense between the outer colonies and the crown. Last year’s trouble with Rear Admiral Mittermeyer could have been a breaking point, and I’m glad that it wasn’t.” He shook his head. “But Duke Braunschweig, for all his other faults, is good at wrestling his relations into compliance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, he has to,” Hilde pointed out. “If he wants his daughter to take the throne, then he needs his clan to fall in line behind him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” her father said. “Though perhaps no one else would say it in as many words.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But people outside of Duke Braunschweig’s circle?” Kircheis asked. “Is there real trouble?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not yet. I’m doing my best to prevent it, and so is everyone else who isn’t eagerly looking forward to trouble starting.” His lips pinched together. “It’s been a long time since I’ve had to travel on business, but I expect that it will soon be necessary for me to go out and speak to some of the frontier nobles in person.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope not,” Hilde said. “This seems like a bad time to travel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father raised his eyebrows. “Do you have more accurate information about the Kaiser’s health than I do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde flushed. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is no good time to travel, my dear. And it will be better to take care of these problems sooner, rather than later. Rot has a tendency to spread.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who is it that you would need to pay a visit to?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Maximilian von Castrop. Are you familiar with him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His father was treasury secretary, many years ago,” her father explained. “He made himself very rich with that, though he wouldn’t have needed it. His planet is a top agricultural exporter. That’s a dangerous thing to be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It can give a planet the illusion of self-sufficiency,” her father said. “His father never fell for that illusion, and he also knew how to toe the line with the crown. His son, I’m afraid, thinks that his father’s prudence was cowardice.” He looked out the window. “Well, we’ll see. I perhaps shouldn’t slander him. He hasn’t done anything too foolish yet, just threatened it. And talk has always been a cheap thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope it comes to nothing, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We all can. I enjoy travelling, but I’d prefer it to be for a more pleasant business, especially these days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If there’s anything I can do to help…” Kircheis offered, which made her father smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I somehow doubt it, sub-lieutenant, but I thank you for the offer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The topic of conversation switched to Hilde’s schoolwork (studying law at Odin National University), which she was quite happy to discuss for the remainder of the ride.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Duke Braunschweig’s manor was massive, far larger than her father’s estate. Even before marrying into the royal family, the Braunschweigs had been a storied noble line, and that was evident in the construction of their ancestral home. The whole building, all white-stone pillars and tall windows that glittered in between them, was lit to a daylight brightness, though the sun had set hours ago. The three guests hurried out of the car and up the steps to be let inside, pushed along by the chill wind. Already, they could hear music straining through the doors, and the long line of parked cars to the side of the building showed that they were far from the first visitors to arrive. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde, her father, and Kircheis were shown into the great hall of the house, where brilliantly decorated tables encircled a dance floor. The room was crowded and loud already, filled with what seemed like half the nobility of the capital. Perhaps it was half the nobility of the capital. There was a party being held at Neue Sanssouci, and in past years, that was the one that Duke Braunschweig and his family had graced with their presence. However, this year, that party was being hosted as a mere formality only, and attended by guests chosen by Secretary of State Lichtenlade, rather than by the Kaiser. It was one of many signs of the Kaiser’s deteriorating health, and it also meant that the two camps in primary competition for the throne, Duke Braunschweig with his daughter Elizabeth, and Marquis Littenheim with his daughter Sabine, were able to hold parties for their own clans and supporters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The party was too loud and crowded for the hosts to greet everyone who walked in at the door. Hilde spotted Princess Amarie across the room, already deep in conversation with a gaggle of women, all dressed in the most elegant gowns imaginable. She didn’t see Duke Braunschweig, but she did see the man she was actually scanning the room to find: Captain Hank von Leigh, who was seated by himself at one of the tables, chin resting on his hands, watching people dance with a rather doleful expression. He had a glass of wine half-drunk in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s Hank!” Hilde said. That was all it took for her father and Kircheis to follow her over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh didn’t notice them coming until they were on top of him, and when he did notice, he stood in a most ungainly manner, nearly tipping his chair over in his haste. Up close, Leigh’s most distinctive features were obvious. His dark eyes, his soft face, his messy crop of hair so black that it was almost blue: all marked him as a foreigner, strikingly different from everyone else in the room. But he smiled, tense and wan, at the three who approached him. Kircheis saluted when they got close, and Leigh saluted back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Mariendorf,” he said, “I didn’t expect to see you here tonight.” Although he and Hilde’s father were good friends, there was a strained note in Leigh’s voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid that I couldn’t turn down the invitation,” her father said. “May we sit?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Leigh said. “Maggie— Baroness Westpfale— is sitting there, but the rest of the seats are free.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie’s here?” Hilde asked. “Where?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh pointed across the room, where Hilde could see that Magdalena von Westpfale was among the circle of Princess Amarie’s hangers-on, now that Hilde knew she was looking for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how did she manage that?” her father asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh flushed and tugged at the hair at the back of his head, a peculiar but endearing nervous gesture. “I told you, we look better together than we do apart, sir,” he said. “She agreed to let me help redeem her from disgrace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father raised his eyebrows. “Congratulations!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I’m missing something,” Hilde said, and glanced at Kircheis, who shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I asked Baroness Westpfale to marry me,” Leigh said. “Just last week. We weren’t intending to make a big deal out of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something in Hilde’s stomach did a strange flip-flop, but she smiled. “Congratulations.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to be the Baron Westpfale, sir?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh cringed and picked up his wine to avoid answering the question, which made some of the odd tension dissipate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will have to find something to drink to your happiness,” Hilde’s father said, taking his seat. Hilde, Kircheis, and Leigh followed suit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir,” Leigh said. He turned to Kircheis. “I expected that you would want an evening off at home away from all of this.” He waved his hand to vaguely encircle the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis smiled. “I don’t mind. Fraulein Hilde wanted an escort.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And her father simply wouldn’t do,” her father said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I had known Maggie was going to be here, I might not have forced you to come,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t have any big plans I’m missing out on,” Kircheis said. “Martin is having some friends over, but I don’t really know them, so I don’t think he minds me skipping out.” Kircheis shared a rented apartment with his friend, Martin Bufholtz, which he claimed was far nicer than the housing that was available to most junior officers. Hilde didn’t know if it really was nicer (it was a little run down, and not particularly spacious), but it was a cozy place that she visited on a fairly regular basis. She and Martin were schoolmates— they both attended Odin National University, though they studied different subjects, and Martin was several years ahead of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should have invited Martin, and you could have tagged along after Hank,” Hilde said, which made Kircheis shake his head with a fond smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think this is really his milieu, Fraulein Hilde.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, probably not,” she agreed. “But it would have been funny.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know if it was Duke Braunschweig or Princess Amarie who invited you?” Leigh asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duke Braunschweig,” her father said. He scanned the room. “I doubt it was very personal as an invitation; there’s plenty of other minor nobility here tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know most of them,” Leigh said. “And it seems like most people in the fleet have ended up at Neue Sanssouci tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d have to think that’s for the best.” But her father continued to look around. “Though there’s Baron Merkatz, and his brother.” He nodded at two grey-haired men. “So, not all fleet staff are at Neue Sanssouci.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. I spoke with Admiral Merkatz earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How is he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, I believe. I’m not sure if he’s happy that I’m working for Duke Braunschweig, but he was glad to see me, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad everyone’s past indiscretions are being forgiven and forgotten, these days. Do you know what he’s doing on Odin? Isn’t he usually stationed out of Iserlohn?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t say, sir.” This phrasing from Leigh set off an alarm in Hilde’s head, but she just listened to the conversation without interjecting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father and Leigh didn’t have time to say much else to each other, though, because Baroness Westpfale had noticed the new arrivals at Leigh’s table and disengaged herself from Princess Amarie’s circle to come swooping over. She wore a beaming smile on her face, brighter by far than the white-sparkling beads of her blue gown.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Mariendorf! I did not expect to see you here!” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nor I, you,” her father said. “I understand some congratulations are in order?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hank, you ruined the surprise,” Magdalena said cheerfully, going over to lean on Leigh’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Congratulations, Maggie,” Hilde said. “Do you have a date set?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no, I haven’t even started </span>
  <em>
    <span>thinking</span>
  </em>
  <span> about planning,” Magdalena said. She tapped her chin with her fingers. “Though I’m sure we mustn’t make it too long of an engagement.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure if we set a date, there will be some sort of calamity that comes up right before it and ruins every plan we have,” Leigh grumbled, though he was smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe we should go to the courthouse tomorrow, then, darling,” Magdalena said with a wicked smile on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tomorrow’s a public holiday,” Leigh countered. “Courthouse won’t be open.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What a tragedy,” Magdalea laughed and flopped down into her seat. She picked someone else to antagonize, and her eyes settled on Kircheis. “Herr Kircheis! How’s your little republican friend doing? The one who wanted to plaster every street corner with propaganda.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The tips of Kircheis’s ears turned red. “He’s fine, Baroness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena laughed. “Hilde, darling, does your father know that you’re hanging around with dangerous elements of society?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie—” Leigh said, but Magdalena just waved her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s no trouble to me, of course,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde’s father looked over at Leigh, who just shrugged, looking embarrassed at Magdalena’s antics. “Hilde has always been a good judge of character,” her father said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I know.” Magdalena leaned forward, elbows on the table, looking between Hilde and Kircheis. “You two ought to try harder to get away from me and my meddling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I like your meddling, Maggie,” Hilde said. “I’m glad you were able to come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you flatter me far too much, my darling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Kircheis smiled and tugged Hilde’s sleeve. “Care to dance?” he asked. “I think she’s trying to get rid of us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would never!” Magdalena said, smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not really dressed to dance,” Hilde said, glancing down at her suit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go enjoy yourself,” her father said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde glanced at Leigh, who gave her a tiny nod, and then finally sighed and got up, heading away from the table with Kircheis. She glanced back at the table a few times as they walked to the dance floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not very good at dancing,” she warned Kircheis as they joined the crowd, offering him her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s alright,” he said. “I don’t mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The music, played by a band at the front of the room, was loud and lovely, some sort of sweeping string piece. “What do you think they’re talking about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Kircheis said. “I’m sure if you ask Captain Leigh, he’d tell you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father probably would, as well.” She frowned, but tried to relax. Dancing with Kircheis wasn’t unpleasant, at least. He was sturdy and sure-footed. Still, she felt quite out of place among all the other dancers in swirling gowns, and now that she wasn’t sitting down at her table, the eyes of other people were on her, not all of them kind. She kept looking around, accidentally catching some stranger’s eye, then looking away back at Kircheis, who was placid as usual.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you look nice,” he said to her after some time, understanding her without her needing to say anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks. I’m a sight better than when I was dressed in a cadet uniform, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You looked good in that, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you flirting with me, Sieg?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just telling you the truth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look nice, too,” she said. “Which is also just the truth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Fraulein,” he said with a little laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On their next turn, she glanced back at the table they had left. Magdalena was leaning on Leigh’s arm, saying something to her father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t believe Maggie’s getting married,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Captain Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you know, I was the one who introduced them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis laughed. “Really?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hank escorted me to a party that Maggie was hosting,” Hilde said. “This was years and years ago. I couldn’t even tell you why I wanted to go so badly. I guess I just wanted to be grown up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t like parties, Fraulein?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do,” she said. “But I don’t know what I expected to get out of going to Maggie’s back then.” She shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not everything you do needs an explanation. Baroness Westpfale invited you to a party, so you went.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just like you’re here because I asked you to come?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled at her. “I can’t blame you for wanting company.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed a little. “You should have just invited me to Martin’s party.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The wine is probably nicer at this one.” He was joking, and so she laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you stay home for Martin’s party, really, Sieg?” she asked. “You’d probably prefer it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—” He looked away for a second. She had hit some sort of nerve that she hadn’t known she was poking at. “I’m sure it’s the same reason why he wouldn’t feel right here.” He rubbed his head, a mannerism that he was sure to have picked up from Leigh. “I’d rather not get too acquainted with all of his friends, in the same way that I can’t talk to him about work.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father doesn’t mind Martin, does he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not,” Hilde said. “He’s glad I have friends at school.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father’s a good man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” There was something in Kircheis’s voice, but it was an old, familiar hesitancy from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He likes you, too, you know, Sieg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He just smiled at her. Hilde didn’t really understand the mental arithmetic that Kircheis did every time he interacted with her father, and no matter how many times she told him he was overthinking it, he wouldn’t listen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They danced for a little while longer, though Kircheis remained quiet and thoughtful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s on your mind, Sieg?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his head. “Nothing, really.” It was his turn to glance back at the table, where Magdalena was pulling Leigh to his feet, tugging him towards the dance floor with a pleading expression. It was clear that he was going to go, but they were both enjoying making her fight for it. “Everything’s just changing so fast,” he said eventually. “Last year was so different— it feels like I don’t know where anything stands anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not just because of that surprise, I hope,” she said, nodding to indicate Magdalena and Leigh, who were making their way onto the dance floor now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “It’s everything. The fleet, the Kaiser, Martin…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde tilted her head. “What’s going on with Martin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing,” he said. But that was clearly a lie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She squeezed his arm. “Well, if it’s any comfort, I’m still the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned his usually calm gaze on her, and when she met his eyes, she was surprised by how wide they were and unsteady he looked. “Fraulein Hilde—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Sieg?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his head and said nothing, then turned to look back at Leigh and Magdalena, who were now dancing. Her head was resting on his shoulder, and his hands were on her waist. They weren’t really dancing, more just standing there in the crowd and shuffling as much as Leigh could manage. Hilde suddenly felt like a voyeur for watching, like she was one of the unfriendly gazes who had been staring at her and Kircheis all night, and she said, “I think I need some air.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis immediately dropped his hands and let her go. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be back,” she said, and then hurried away, feeling bad in a way that she couldn’t define about whatever it was that had just happened. It seemed like </span>
  <em>
    <span>nothing</span>
  </em>
  <span> had happened, and yet Kircheis was right: for some reason, everything was changing, and ground that had once been solid was shifting beneath her feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Freeing herself from the crowd on the dance floor gave Hilde some measure of relief, but she hadn’t been lying when she said that she needed air. It was hot in the room, and she was sweating under her suit. As she passed a table of refreshments, she picked up a wineglass, and then spotted a door to one of the balconies that overlooked the Braunschweig’s garden. It was freezing outside, so she was sure to be able to steal just a moment for herself to come back to her senses out there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde looked around to make sure no one would scold her for going out, then pushed open the glass door quickly, stepping out into the ice-cold night air. It was an immediate relief. The air was crisp, and her breath rose around her in a cloud. The music and thrum of the crowd was now only faint behind her, and she leaned on the stone balcony railing and looked out over the bare night garden, only a few statues illuminated by spotlights. Thus distracted, it took her far too long to realize that she was not alone on the wide balcony, as she had expected that she would be. She was being silently observed by someone a little ways away, who must have come out the other door to the same balcony, and had been standing there silently before Hilde arrived.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other person was dressed much more warmly than Hilde was: wrapped in a fur jacket so voluminous that the individual hairs moved in dappled, shifting patterns with the slight breeze that blew across the balcony. She was young, Hilde’s age or a year or two younger. Her dark hair was elaborately done up, and a silver coronet with segments like twinkling stars sat atop her head. Beneath her jacket, Hilde could see the bottom third of the emerald green gown she was wearing. Golden light from indoors spilled across her face, and Hilde recognized who the woman was. This was Elizabeth von Braunschweig, one of the claimants to the throne. They had never spoken before, but they had occasionally been in the same social spaces, and she was recognizable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde turned, then bowed to her. “I’m sorry, Lady Elizabeth,” she said. “I didn’t see you there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth waved her hand. “It’s fine,” she said. “It’s just too hot in there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t mind the company?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Elizabeth said. Moved by some impulse, Hilde walked towards her, wine glass in hand. Elizabeth looked her over more carefully. “You’ll be freezing in a minute.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” Hilde said. Her suit was warmer than it looked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you were a gentleman, before you said anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Hilde flush, though the dim light and the fact that her cheeks were already turning red from the cold did plenty to hide it. “No,” she said. “I’ve just never preferred dresses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Strange,” Elizabeth said, turning back towards the garden. “I couldn’t picture myself in trousers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re comfortable,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s your name?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hildegarde von Mariendorf. Count Mariendorf’s daughter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I’ve met your father at Neue Sanssouci before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde didn’t know what to say to that. “It’s a lovely party,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s my mother’s doing. And the staff, of course.” She leaned forward on the railing. “I had nothing to do with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t it for your sake?” Hilde asked, feeling strangely bold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth laughed. “Maybe.” She turned around, so that she could rest her back on the railing and look at Hilde more easily. “I assume since you’re here, your father intends to support mine when my grandfather dies?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think it’s my right to give you that answer,” Hilde said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Elizabeth smile for the first time. “Of course.” She noticed the wine glass clutched in Hilde’s hand. “Are you going to drink that?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde had forgotten all about it, and her fingers were now so cold that she could barely feel them. “Oh, uh, no, I suppose not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth reached out and took it from her hand, tugging it from Hilde’s frozen grip by prying her fingers off of it. Her hands, from being tucked inside the sleeves of her fur coat, were quite warm, and Hilde’s eyes widened at Elizabeth’s boldness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To your health, Lady Mariendorf,” Elizabeth said, raising the glass with a strange smirk. She winced at how cold the glass was when she put it to her lips, but drank the whole thing in one go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just Hilde, if it pleases you,” Hilde managed to say, watching Elizabeth down the wine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde, then. But I don’t expect you to call me Liz.” She looked at the empty glass, then held it back out for Hilde to take, which she did, confused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Lady Elizabeth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My mother would hate to see me drinking,” she said, by way of explanation, though that only covered a fraction of Hilde’s confusion. Elizabeth looked at Hilde for a moment more, then said, “You really are going to freeze out here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” Hilde said again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth looked at her for a moment, then shrugged off her fur coat and handed it to Hilde, who took it, too surprised to say anything. Elizabeth’s shoulders were bare now, and gooseflesh rose on her arms instantly. Taking off her coat revealed a brilliant necklace with a stone that sparkled at the hollow of her throat. “I ought to go back to this party. As you say, it is for my sake. Now that you’ve fortified me, it should be a little easier,” she said. “But if you still insist on getting some air, you might as well be warm while you do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Lady Elizabeth,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If our fathers are to be allies, I’m sure I’ll see you again,” Elizabeth said, and without another word, she pushed open the glass door and went back inside the party. Hilde slipped the fur coat on. It was still warm from Elizabeth’s body, and it smelled like her perfume, something floral and girlish. Hilde wrapped it tight around herself, not wanting to go back inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stayed out there for a long while, just thinking, and she had just about worked up the strength to go back into the party when the balcony door opened behind her, and Leigh came out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sub-lieutenant Kircheis was worried that you had vanished into the ether, you know,” Leigh said, startling her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I’m sorry,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did he do something to upset you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sieg? No, I don’t think so. I just needed some space.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand,” he said. “These things can be a challenge to get through in one piece.” He ran his hand through his hair, then tilted his head back to look up at the sky. “I’m sorry for chasing you away from the table, earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” Hilde said. “I understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for understanding.” Leigh seemed content to stand in silence and look up at the stars. It was a brilliantly clear night out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You aren’t having some kind of argument with my father, are you?” she asked after a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you ask that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Neither of you seemed happy to see the other tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any other night, any other place,” Leigh said with a sigh. “I think it’s a mistake for your father to ally with Duke Braunschweig.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Hilde said. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because he’s doing it only because I’m here, and I don’t deserve that kind of loyalty.” He shook his head. “There’s no way that this won’t be bloody, and I wish he— and you— didn’t have to get caught up in it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was Duke Braunschweig who invited him, not you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duke Braunschweig knows that your father’s contacts and talents from working in the Colonial Affairs office would be useful to have. Even small, outlying colonies might have a part to play in a civil war.” He stuck his hands into his pockets. “Your father would make a fine emissary, and he’s well respected among the smaller noble houses— there are many reasons for Braunschweig to curry your father’s favor. But that’s not why your father came.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t want us to be on different sides.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh pulled his gaze back to the ground and smiled at her. “I know.” He turned back to look at the garden. “And I know that there isn’t going to be any avoiding choosing sides, and in the end if he must choose a side I’m glad that it’s mine, but all the same…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’d you get that coat?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Hilde said, and felt embarrassed. “It’s Elizabeth von Braunschweig’s. She let me borrow it. I’ll have to give it back to her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I think this was the first time we ever spoke.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what did you think of her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know.” That was the truest thing that Hilde could say. She looked at the empty wine glass, which had been left on the balcony railing, and curled her fists in the warm pockets of the coat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I say something?” Leigh asked. “An observation, I suppose?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think everyone is trying to forget that she is the one who will wear the crown, not Duke Braunschweig. Everyone should be remembering that they’ll have to swear fealty to her, not her father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll keep that in mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We should go back inside, or Kircheis will think that we’ve both been abducted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Hilde said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked back in together, and with some reluctance, Hilde found a servant to hand Elizabeth’s coat to, so that it could be returned to its rightful owner. The rest of the party passed much more cheerfully until near midnight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whatever tension that had passed between her and Kircheis no longer felt material, and her father and Leigh had mended their discomfort while she had been gone. And suddenly, watching Magdalena torment Leigh and him cheerfully grimace at her antics didn’t strike any strange chords in her heart. Instead, Hilde found herself scanning the crowd to catch glimpses of the dark-haired Elizabeth, who sometimes stood by her mother’s side, and sometimes by her father’s. Hilde almost wanted to go speak to her, but decided against it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At around midnight, she stood in between her father and Kircheis to listen to Duke Braunschweig’s sonorous toast to the future of the Empire, the health of Kaiser Friedrich IV, and the spirit of friendship between all the guests in the room. Leigh looked annoyed with it all, but he smiled when everyone began counting down to midnight, and he raised his glass as enthusiastically as everyone else when the clock struck and the band began to play.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena didn’t let him drink his toast, and kissed him, instead, which made him blush.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should know that </span>
  <em>
    <span>that’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>what you’re supposed to do at New Year’s, Hank,” she said. “Now you can drink.” And she knocked her glass against his, laughing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis seemed pensive, and Hilde nudged him to get his attention over the rendition of ‘Auld Lang Syne’ the band was playing. “Happy New Year, Sieg,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Happy New Year, Fraulein Hilde,” he said, and smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you thinking about?” she asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Auld acquaintance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This got Leigh’s attention. “Isn’t it funny to think that everyone around the galaxy is celebrating this night just the same?” he asked. “No matter where they are.” His own expression and tone were melancholy, for a moment, “Iserlohn, Phezzan, Heinessen… We all want the new year to treat us well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope it does,” Hilde’s father said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh opened his mouth to say something, then closed it again. Hilde knew what he was thinking, and was glad that he hadn’t said it aloud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure it will,” Hilde said. “Happy New Year!”</span>

  <em>
    <span>January 487 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Duke Braunschweig did not keep his military staff as pets in his estate. He had a three story brownstone not far from the Ministry of War, where most of his staff officers had desks. It was a pleasant building, for all that it was filled with people Yang did not much care to associate with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Duke Braunschweig technically held the rank of admiral in the Imperial fleet, but this was more of an inherited or honorary title than a mark of experienced command. As far as Yang was aware, the duke had never engaged in active combat, nor had he been trained for it in any meaningful way. His paper rank came from the fact that he had exercised his noble right to command the troops who originated from his territories. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The vast majority of nobles, especially minor nobility, pledged their soldiers directly to the crown. They lacked either the desire to command, the raw numbers of pledged troops to make it  worthwhile, or the courage to flaunt the rights that they technically possessed. It also spared them a financial burden of supporting their own army. These conscripted troops from minor holdings made up the majority of the actual fighting force of the Empire— all of those who served in fleets under career soldiers appointed by the Kaiser, like Fleet Admiral Muckenburger. Troops from nobles like Duke Braunschweig could technically be called into service by the crown, either commanded by their lord, or loaned to the crown to be commanded by a more experienced officer. Duke Braunschweig’s troops, since they were so great in number, were occasionally used in this way, but as Kaiser Friedrich’s health declined, there were fewer and fewer large military dispatches planned that required these extra forces.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had actually been a little troublesome for Duke Braunschweig to arrange for Yang (and, with him, Kircheis) to be transferred to his staff, since both were registered citizens of Odin, and therefore the crown directly. Fleet Admiral Muckenburger had apparently protested the transfer, which had surprised Yang when he learned about it through the grapevine. But Duke Braunschweig had managed it, through sheer force of will, or through petitioning the Kaiser— it was unclear to Yang. One thing was certain: Yang was worth far more than his salary, as Duke Braunschweig was paying some hefty fee to have him “on loan” from the crown. This made any and all of his wasted time while in his office at work feel all the sweeter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had now been working for Duke Braunschweig for more than half a year, and it certainly showed in the state of his tiny office. The neatest part of it were the maps on the wall, displaying every inhabited planet of the Empire, every space fortress, every critical mining zone, vague navigable routes— all the information that could be crammed onto a map at a glance. Every time he looked at the maps, Yang was tempted to cover them with pins and notes, but then sighed at what a frightful breach of security that would be, since he knew he would invariably forget to take them down, and then didn’t. This left the maps as pristine as the day that they had been unrolled from their poster tubes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everywhere else, though, was a different story. The bookshelves behind Yang’s desk were crammed with volumes, some of them turned on their sides with the page-side out, so that bookmarks with descriptions of what the relevant passages were could be read with a simple flip of fingers down the stack. The desk was covered half in scattered incomprehensible papers of supreme importance only to Yang, and half in random garbage: empty bowls from microwave meals, candy wrappers, a plate full of used teabags that had formed into a solid dry mountain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Amidst all of this, Yang sat with his computer in front of him, a single useable spot carved in the chaos. He often pulled his feet up onto his plush chair, his knees resting against the edge of his heavy desk, and leaned forward so that he could look sideways out his office window, catching glimpses of the passers-by on the street below, or the birds that were nesting in the eaves of the roof across the way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was rarely disturbed in his office, except on occasion by Kircheis. No one else in the building seemed to know what to make of him. While most of Duke Braunschweig’s staff officers were concerned with the provisioning and maintenance of his fleet and the interfacing of it with the larger Imperial military, Yang had his own special tasks, the results of which were reported directly to Duke Braunschweig. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was hilarious that Duke Braunschweig had pinned the task of planning an entire war on one man. What was even funnier was that he had managed to find one of the few people in the Imperial military remotely qualified to do it. Yang knew he had plenty of shortcomings: he lacked the years of experience that someone like Fleet Admiral Muckenburger had; he was less of a strategist than he was a tactician; he did not have access to many important resources and pieces of information; he suspected that when time came to put his plans into action, he would be unable to convince Duke Braunschweig to follow them; and, perhaps most importantly, he didn’t know if he truly wanted to succeed. But even with all of that, Yang’s time in the PI unit under Rear Admiral Bronner had given him a clear understanding of the talents and tactics of most relevant commanders in the Imperial fleet, and his thousands of hours playing war games had prepared him to grasp the scope of a conflict writ large. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was still a fantasy story that he was weaving, another false battle, and it made Yang nostalgic for years ago, at the IOA. He would sometimes stare into space, thinking of a particularly elegant solution to a problem, and be seized by the urge to tell Reuenthal about it. Or he would laugh to himself when he jotted down a note that he knew, if he had still been a student, would have made Staden put a gigantic red question mark on one of his strats postmortems. Sometimes, he’d flip through the list of commanders that he suspected that Littenheim was going to be able to recruit to his side, and he would hear Bronner’s voice in his ear, saying something like, “He’s miscast for the role you’re having him play.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Yang hadn’t had the sense that in a few short years (or even months) this would all become terrifyingly real, he might have enjoyed it. But as it was, he lost sleep over it, and that only grew worse the more pieces came into play, the more resources he encouraged Braunschweig to gather, the more allies he pointed out that he should encourage to come to his side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had begun his planning with the goal of ending the civil war as quickly as possible, to prevent as much collateral damage to the citizens of the Empire as he could. If he kept that idea in mind, he could at least make himself move forward. But the more he shuffled the pieces around before him, the more complex it seemed by the moment. He was haunted by knowing that there was no perfect strategy, but he was compelled to search for one regardless. He thought if he kept at this long enough, he would go slightly insane.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was almost a relief, then, when a new and different problem landed in his lap, (or really, his email inbox) completely out of the blue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The message was innocuous enough on its surface.</span>
</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Dear Captain von Leigh,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I doubt you remember me, but I took your class on Ancient Earth History a few years back. It’s probably very strange for me to be contacting you, but I’ve been working in the Embassy on Phezzan since I graduated, and I’ve had the pleasure of hearing your name mentioned a few times.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>In particular, I met this man at a party who said that he had once been aboard Rear Admiral von Reuenthal’s flagship, and knew you, or knew of you, in any event. He asked me to tell you that he sends his regards to your favorite student. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch his name, but I’m hoping that you understand more of what he was talking about than I did.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I hear that you’ve left the IOA. I’m surprised— I thought you were a good teacher, at least. How is working for Duke Braunschweig? If I’m honest with you, that is not a staff posting that I would have chosen for myself haha. Congratulations on your promotion, though.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I hope you are doing well.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Very respectfully,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Lt. Cmdr. Neidhart Muller</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>IOA Class of 482, Strategic Warfare Division</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
  <span>Although it had been several years, Yang </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> remember Muller. He had been a senior when Yang had taught him, his very first year of teaching at the IOA. Muller had been fresh faced, with sandy-light hair and an enthusiasm for everything. Yang couldn’t remember where in his class he had graduated— Yang wasn’t teaching the SW class at the time, so it hadn’t been relevant to him. Muller must have been near the top, because being assigned the embassy on Phezzan was a coveted position, and Muller had been promoted quite quickly since he graduated. In Yang’s class, he had done well, despite Yang grading his first crop of students unduly harshly. (He had tempered his expectations for student performance after his first semester of classes.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All of that was well and good: Yang liked Muller, and Muller had respected him as a teacher, even if they had never spoken outside of class.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The problem was, Yang knew exactly what Muller was trying to communicate to him with this vague ramble about someone he met on Phezzan, and it was sure to be nothing but trouble.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, what the unwitting messenger Muller couldn’t have known was that all of Yang’s mail was read by his insatiably nosy former superior, Rear Admiral Deitrich Bronner. He had been a commodore when Yang had worked for him, but he had recently gotten a long overdue promotion, and an accordingly larger role at the Ministry of War. That had not stopped him from spying on Yang, whom he considered his personal project. Usually, Yang didn’t mind it that much; he knew better than to write most things down. Muller had definitely stumbled into a minefield with this message, though.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, Yang held off on talking to the actual intended recipient of the message, waiting for Bronner to mosey up to Braunschweig’s admiralty offices and knock primly on Yang’s door, which he did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come in,” Yang called, hastily flipping shut the notebook at his right hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner strode in, looking with an owlish disdain at the mess in Yang’s office. Yang stood and saluted to greet him. “I figured you’d get around to visiting me,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what made you so sure of that?” Bronner asked, taking a seat in front of Yang’s desk, in the chair that only Kircheis ever used.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t a visit to congratulate me on my engagement to Baroness Westpfale?” Yang asked, smiling. “The formal engagement announcement and banns were in the newspaper last week.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll congratulate you when the curtain finally closes on the whole affair,” Bronner said. “I notice that you didn’t put a date for the wedding in the announcement.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It hasn’t been chosen yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suggest you choose one,” Bronner said, voice dry. “And make it soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think there’s any need to rush.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t politics, Leigh. This is personal advice: an overly long engagement only leads to trouble.” Yang remembered that the reason Merkatz had sent him to work for Bronner was that Bronner had once had a two-year-long engagement to Merkatz’s daughter, though the whole thing had been broken off before it could turn into a marriage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The personal is political,” Yang said. “But I’ll stop pretending that I don’t know what you’re here for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Too bad. I was hoping to see if your acting skills had improved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m still working from a second-rate script,” Yang said. “And you would know, since you’re still reading my mail.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner’s lips curled in a thin but amused smile. “It’s not every day that a former ‘Phezzani’ starts getting strangely vague mail from the embassy on Phezzan. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Especially</span>
  </em>
  <span> mail that talks about another person who requires a watching eye.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t have any eyes left to do your actual job if you’re using one to spy on me and the other on Sub-lieutenant Kircheis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Spying?” Bronner said. “Hardly. It’s simply that I have orchestra seats to your performance, right near the stage.” He trailed his fingers through the air, like he was conducting some music. “Watching all the players come and go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, explain it to me, if you would, Captain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not going to like what I have to say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to tell you that this is completely harmless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner didn’t react. “Leigh, let me tell you something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are just a little too valuable to be let out of my sight at the moment. I wouldn’t want to see you dragged out of your post and sent to a work camp on the frontier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m flattered,” Yang said in as deadpan of a voice as he could muster.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, it’s probably not your skin on the line here if you don’t convince me of this all being harmless. It’s— what was his name again?” Bronner prompted. Yang was sure he knew the name, but wanted to annoy Yang, or see if Yang had any reaction to saying Muller’s name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lieutenant Commander Muller,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s right. You seem to remember his name well enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I remember him as a student,” Yang said. “But nothing much more than that.” He shrugged. “He wasn’t a special project of mine, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pity. They’re always so interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang just rolled his eyes. “Muller wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> interesting. If he was, you and I both know he wouldn’t have gotten posted to Phezzan. Interesting is not a thing you want in people working at the embassy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very true.” Bronner smiled again. “And I did check up on his family. His lovely parents are still comfortably at home, with the same check that he sends them every month to help pay off their house— nothing more and nothing less.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you didn’t bother them,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not.” Yang couldn’t tell if Bronner was lying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suspect that if there had been any other recent IOA graduate there in Muller’s place who had me as a teacher, they would have gotten the same request to pass along the message. Muller’s just the pigeon carrying it home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About as intelligent as one, too,” Bronner intoned. “He should know better than to put any of this on paper.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is only suspicious because you’re already suspicious of me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Suspicious? I wouldn’t describe it that way. Merely curious.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s much better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner just smiled thinly. “So, convince me that this is harmless, Leigh. What’s this all about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know who the person Muller is talking about is, or do I have to explain it to you?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Muller had said in his letter, the person who had once been aboard Reuenthal’s ship was sure to be Reinhard von Müsel, formerly a cadet at the Alliance’s equivalent of the IOA. While Reinhard had been working in a summer posting at a starship facility called Condor Base, he and one of his coworkers, another cadet named Fredrica Greenhill (notably, the daughter of one of the Alliance’s most respected admirals) had survived an attack by Reuenthal on the base. Somehow, they then proceeded to sneak aboard Reuenthal’s flagship, free a swathe of prisoners of war, commandeer one of the other ships in the fleet, and escape. It had been a major personal embarrassment for Reuenthal, since Reinhard even had the gall to impersonate an Imperial lieutenant, and went into Reuenthal’s office to speak to him personally. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although he would have never admitted it to Reuenthal, who was like a ruffled cat whenever the subject was brought up, Yang found the whole thing very funny. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What Reinhard was doing on Phezzan, or why he had occasion to talk to Muller, Yang didn’t know.  He also had no idea if Bronner had been following the news on Phezzan closely enough to put all these pieces together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You take all the fun out of things.” Bronner reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of folded paper. He looked like he was about to slide it across the desk to Yang, but the clutter on Yang’s desk made that impossible, so he just held it out with a look of disdain. Yang took it and unfolded it, revealing a photocopy of an intelligence report from the Phezzani embassy: a rote description of one of the Alliance’s staff at their own High Commissioner’s office on Phezzan. It was accompanied, of course, by a picture of Reinhard von Müsel. His long golden hair was done in twin french braids, and he was wearing a lieutenant commander’s pin on his collar and a frown on his face. The photograph had been taken with a long zoom lens: he appeared to be walking down the street, lost in thought. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this your man?” Bronner asked</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He is. I didn’t know that was where he was working, or that he had gotten promoted so quickly. He just graduated from their school last year, as far as I’m aware,” Yang said, putting down the paper, though he didn’t give it back to Bronner. “I suppose the rebel fleet doesn't subscribe to the idea of not letting interesting people work at their embassy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That actually made Bronner chuckle. “I get the impression that they enjoy having interesting people work there. It’s some sort of public relations scheme.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shame that we gave up on public relations sometime under Rudolph the Great.” He was tempted to add a more scathing criticism of the Empire’s handling of the public, but decided against it, considering who he was talking to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner was too used to Yang to react to what he had said, at least. “What I would like to know, Leigh, is what this interesting man wants with your little protégé.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They used to be friends,” Yang said. “Müsel there is an expat; he and Kircheis were next door neighbors, years ago.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang couldn’t help but feel distantly fond of Reinhard, despite the fact that they were on opposite sides of a war and had never met. Anyone that Kircheis liked, Yang was sure he would like also. And did feel a solidarity with refugees, even though Reinhard had fled in the opposite direction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was funny, the strings of fate that connected them across the universe. It was only by staggering coincidence that Reinhard knew who Yang was, or how to contact him. Reinhard happened to eavesdrop on an ansible conversation that Yang had with Reuenthal, where they discussed sending Kircheis to join Reuenthal’s fleet upon his graduation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a coded message passed hand to hand across the galaxy, it really was simple and sincere. At heart, it was, “Hello, old friend, I’ve missed you.” All Yang had to do was convince Bronner of that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That strains the limits of my imagination,” Bronner said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. “It’s true enough. I can prove it to you, if you’d like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would very much like,” Bronner said. “But before you prove it, tell me why this neighbor went to all this trouble to contact Sub-lieutenant Kircheis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fairly sure that Müsel really was just saying hello. There’s not much information in that letter, is there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There could be some sort of code.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The day you break it, let me know. I think that the only reason that this greeting has gone through such a winding route is because Müsel genuinely had no other way to contact Kircheis, after having lost touch with him years ago.” Yang said. He tilted his head and looked at Bronner. “I recall during that incident with Rear Admiral Mittermeyer, you seemed very sure that Kircheis would be able to speak to anyone, on any planet he liked.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did I?” Bronner asked, voice dry. “I don’t recall.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang just stared him down, but Bronner refused to admit anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In any event,” Yang said, “This is harmless. And, even if it wasn’t, you’re keeping so close of an eye on Kircheis that I’m sure he couldn’t even sneeze in Phezzan’s direction without you making note of it somewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner smiled. “The question remains, Leigh: what are you going to do about this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do?” Yang asked, then sighed. Bronner wasn’t stupid. He leaned his chin on his hands, elbows on his desk. “I’ve been told that Müsel has a particular desire to destroy the Goldenbaum dynasty. I suppose I should keep an eye on him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And are you going to pass along this message to your favorite student?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Answer my question.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Yang said. He might have elaborated, but he had no desire to give Bronner much more than was necessary.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner looked at him for a long second. Yang wanted to squirm, but he didn’t. “You keep an eye, then, Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean by that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A more sensible person would ignore this message, and not respond.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think I’m going to write Muller back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course you will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why do you say that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because neither one of us can resist peeking behind the curtain whenever we get the chance,” Bronner said finally. It sounded like an admission, and it made Yang smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, sir, there could be worse things for us to have in common.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner shook his head. “Not for all the money on Phezzan would I want to have more in common with you, Leigh.” He leaned forward. “But before I let this drop for now— you mentioned you had proof?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do.” He checked the time— it was just after noon, and Kircheis was almost certainly at lunch right now. Yang stood, and stretched, though the motion caused a few papers to fall to the floor. He looked at them with an annoyed frown, then left them where they lay. He went to the door. “Come on,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are we going?” Bronner asked, suspicions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kircheis’s desk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure he’s gone off to lunch,” Yang said, leading Bronner through the hallway and then down the back stairs. The second floor was different in layout than the third. The rooms off the hallway were larger, and were filled with cubicles for the more junior staff. Yang was glad he had an office. Most of the junior officers were off at lunch, though there were a few still at their desks, and they stood, alarmed, when they saw the rear admiral stripes on Bronner’s shoulders. Bronner waved them back down and then ignored them, as Yang led him to the back of the room to Kircheis’s desk, tucked up against one frosty window. Kircheis, as Yang had anticipated, was not there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s your man,” Yang said, pointing at the single framed photograph on Kircheis’s desk. It showed a fifteen year old girl and two ten year old boys. The striking red hair of one of the boys marked him as Kircheis, while the girl and the boy were both blonde and angelic. There was a lock of that hair tucked in between the photograph and the frame.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner reached to pick it up, but Yang said, “Leave it alone,” and Bronner complied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They were close, it seems,” he said, looking at the hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Across the room, the heavy door swung open. Yang and Bronner’s heads both snapped up, and Yang was quite embarrassed to see that it was Kircheis walking in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was good at keeping his face placid. “Were you looking for me, Rear Admiral, Captain?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s good that you’re here, actually, Sub-lieutenant—” Bronner began, but Yang cut him off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I </span>
  </em>
  <span>was looking for you. Rear Admiral Bronner was just leaving,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner took Yang’s interruption in stride. “Of course. I’ll see myself out. Have an </span>
  <em>
    <span>excellent</span>
  </em>
  <span> day, Sub-lieutenant.” He nodded to Yang, then pushed past him and Kircheis to head to the door. Yang was grateful that this was all it took to get Bronner to leave. If he had chosen to cause a scene about Kircheis’s relationship— current or former— with Reinhard there in the office, it would have been deeply unpleasant. As it was, Yang was sure that Bronner would be writing everything he knew or suspected down in his endless notes, but there was nothing Yang could do to stop him from doing that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After Bronner left, Kircheis asked, with a more honest note of concern in his voice, “What can I do for you, Captain Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come up to my office, for one thing,” Yang said. “I have something to give to you.” He scratched the back of his head, then said, “It’s funny— I’m not sure if you’ll appreciate having it or not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re making me nervous, sir,” Kircheis said. They walked out of the junior officers’ cubicle room and back upstairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing back early from lunch?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin’s exam ran late, so he couldn’t meet me,” he said. “So I came back early.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They climbed the creaking back stairs, and Yang unlocked his office door and let Kircheis in. When the door closed behind them, Kircheis relaxed, just a little. He always held his hands so stiffly when he was nervous, like he was resisting with all his strength the temptation to curl them into fists. When he sat down in the chair in front of Yang’s desk, his hands now draped loosely over the armrests, though one finger picked at some of the chipped varnish on the wood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it that you wanted to talk to me about?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was going to wait until later this afternoon, but it might as well be now,” Yang said. He sat down in his own chair, pulling his legs up to sit as cross legged as possible, though his knees were bent upwards by the armrests. “I received a letter the other day,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About what, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About nothing, really.” He pulled at his hair again. There was no easy way to deliver this information. “Your childhood friend, Reinhard von Müsel—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis immediately stiffened in his seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“—says hello,” Yang finished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The paper that Bronner had handed Yang was still on his desk, and he handed it to Kircheis, who read it over, his eyes wide. The edge of the paper shook; he wasn’t holding it steady.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Kircheis read, Yang said, “He met a former student of mine, Lieutenant Commander Muller, who’s stationed at the embassy on Phezzan, and convinced him to pass along a message. He’s lucky I knew how to interpret it.” Yang opened his computer and pulled up the message, then spun it around so that Kircheis could read it. “It really is just ‘hello.’”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is what Rear Admiral Bronner was here for?” Kircheis asked. He was trying very hard to be professional. His mask was firmly in place, but Yang knew he was wearing a mask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you going to do, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The question is, Kircheis, what would </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> like me to do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—” There was so much strange emotion wrapped up in that single syllable. Kircheis stifled it and tried again. “I don’t know, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bronner expects me to send a reply to Muller.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would he let you do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want the truth, Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis thought about this for a second too long for comfort. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bronner would let me do it because, as a soldier in His Majesty’s fleet, I should try to use this opening to see if there is a weakness that can be exploited. To see if Reinhard von Müsel’s desire to speak with you might lead to him giving something valuable away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He won’t, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe not. Bronner, I’m sure, also thinks that there’s a possibility that Müsel is fishing for weaknesses in our fleet, trying to find someone he could turn to his side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis looked down at the paper in his hands. “I don’t think Reinhard would do that to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You trust him very much, for a man you haven’t seen in a decade.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know him,” Kircheis said. “And…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He made me a promise, a long time ago. I think he’s still keeping it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t ask what it was.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Yang said, “think on this. I don’t think there’s any hurry to respond, if you want me to respond.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang let his feet fall back down to the floor with a final thump. “That’s all I really have for you,” he said. “I’ve just been a messenger for a messenger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for telling me, sir,” Kircheis said. “You didn’t have to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did,” Yang said. “I would like to think that you and I can be honest with each other, at least.” Even as he said that, he offered Kircheis a somewhat apologetic smile, because even that wasn’t true. “I trust you, even if Rear Admiral Bronner doesn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis met his eyes. Yang wasn’t sure what he saw in them, but it was earnest, whatever it was. “Thank you, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just be careful,” Yang said. “Bronner is keeping tabs on you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will.” And then Kircheis stood, and with a nodded goodbye, headed out of Yang’s office. Yang noticed belatedly that he had taken the intelligence report on Reinhard with him.</span>

  <em>
    <span>January 487 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Captain Leigh should have waited until Kircheis was about to leave for the day to tell him about the letter. Since it was right after lunch, the rest of his work day was sure to be ruined. Kircheis was a good worker, and usually could focus on his tasks despite distractions, but there were very few things that could have knocked him as off-balance as this news. His daily tasks, a list of subjects to research for Leigh and some scheduling of fleet resupply that had been pushed onto his plate by the more senior staff in Braunschweig’s office, fell by the wayside. All Kircheis could do was look back and forth between the framed photograph on his desk and the wrinkled paper in his hand, comparing the Reinhard he had known in childhood to the one he saw in the new image.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t as though he hadn’t seen recent photographs of Reinhard before. There had been the grainy security footage in the Phezzani newspapers along with his school yearbook photo. But this was somehow different. It wasn’t just that the image was clearer, and that the expression on his face— a tight lipped half-scowl— was familiar. Although Kircheis knew it was unlikely, he couldn’t help but imagine that in this picture, he was what Reinhard was thinking about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He got himself a cup of coffee, then let it go cold at his elbow as he stared at the pictures some more. Lieutenant commander! Reinhard outranked him by a mile. The thought made Kircheis smile. It seemed like the natural order of things, in a way. It must have been his actions at Condor Base that had earned him such a promotion, even though they had happened when he was a student. Unless he had been allowed to leave school early, and had been promoted several times within the year? Kircheis wished he knew. What he wanted, more than anything in the universe, was to sit down across a table from Reinhard and listen to him tell every story he had from the past ten years. He could just imagine his voice, deeper with age but still with the authoritative tone that he assumed Reinhard would never drop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was impossible, of course. There was no way that Kircheis could go to Phezzan, even if it would have technically been legal. It was frustrating, to be so close and so far away. He would have to make do with this, a flash of communication.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Had Reinhard reached out just because of the connection that they shared? Or did he want to ask Kircheis for something? The idea was heavy in his stomach. He had, with Reinhard, sworn to destroy the Goldenbaum dynasty, a decade ago. Reinhard had told him to gain power by joining the fleet, and although Kircheis had not been planning to, he had done exactly that. With Captain Leigh, he had nestled himself up to the presumptive heir of the Goldenbaum throne.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What, exactly, did that mean for the promise that Kircheis had made to Reinhard, all those years ago? He didn’t know. And asking that question of himself only brought up more complicated and pressing ones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What was Kircheis doing here under Braunschweig? He was going to have to answer that question eventually. When he lifted his head to look above the edge of his cubicle, he could just see the Braunschweig family crest, carved and painted wood, hanging on the wall across the room. He knew he was here because he had wanted to follow Captain Leigh. Leigh had offered to find him a place elsewhere— there were many places that he could have gone— but Kircheis had wanted to stay with him, even if Leigh did feel like it was stifling his career.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But what was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Leigh </span>
  </em>
  <span>doing under Braunschweig? Of course, Kircheis knew about the trade that Leigh had made: his services in exchange for Rear Admiral Mittermeyer’s life. But that didn’t explain Leigh’s ultimate goal. And Leigh must have had some kind of goal. Kircheis thought back to one of the first conversations that he had with Leigh, sitting across from him at Josef’s bar, Leigh’s legs all twisted up in the booth seat as they talked about ambition. He had said that he wanted to do more good than harm in the universe, and so he must have thought that he could accomplish that somehow under Braunschweig.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis could never ask Leigh directly if he was planning to overthrow Braunschweig when he was weak, after the civil war that was sure to be coming. It didn’t seem like that was the case from the work that Leigh was having him do, but Leigh wouldn’t be careless enough to let anyone else figure that out, even if it had been his intention. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Did Kircheis want to overthrow Duke Braunschweig, and the Goldenbaum throne with him? When he thought about what he wanted, his ambitions for the wider world, he wasn’t able to form a coherent picture. The Goldenbaum dynasty was wrong, certainly. He could see that clearly enough. But even if he and Captain Leigh were in a position to replace it with something else, what was that other thing? Did Leigh want the same things that Reinhard did? Or even the same things that Martin did?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was funny. All his life, Kircheis found himself following behind people who saw their goals very clearly, while he stayed as their helpful shadow, tagging along. First Reinhard, and then Martin, and now Captain Leigh. He could admit that part of the reason that he had fallen in love with Martin was because his passion reminded him of Reinhard’s, if in a different way. The thought made him smile, though another glance at the photo of Reinhard made the smile feel uncomfortable on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the end of the day, he hurried out of the office and began the long trek back home. The apartment he shared with Martin was far closer to Odin National University than it was to the Ministry of War, though Kircheis didn’t mind. The subway trip and the brisk walk in the cold air was usually a good time to push all of his workday thoughts out of his mind before he saw Martin. He needed the separation between those two worlds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, today, even the light snowfall couldn’t distract Kircheis enough, and when he arrived back at home he was actually startled to walk in the door and find Martin sitting at the kitchen table, a pen between his teeth as he furrowed his brow at his computer. Kircheis didn’t know what he had been expecting to find at home. His mind had just been elsewhere. He shrugged off his jacket and went to change out of his uniform before saying anything to Martin, who looked up at him with a smile when he came in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Kircheis was in his underwear in the bedroom, fishing new clothes out of the closet, Martin wandered in, trailed his friendly hand across Kircheis’s back, then sat down on the bed. “Rough day at work?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “Just strange.” He pulled a new shirt on over his head so that he wouldn’t have to look at Martin for a moment, then turned to face him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Strange in a way you can talk about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not really,” Kircheis said. “I got some unexpected news from Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin raised an eyebrow, and Kircheis shook his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s complicated. I’m just not sure what to do about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How was your exam?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Martin said. “I’m sorry I couldn’t meet you for lunch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright.” He found pants and sat down next to Martin on the bed to pull them on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seem very out of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perceptive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I try.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have any plans for dinner?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think there’s some leftover meatloaf…” Martin said, then trailed off, catching Kircheis’s expression. “You want to go out, since we missed lunch?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Kircheis said. “That sounds good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure. Give me twenty minutes.” He leaned over to press a kiss to Kircheis’s cheek, then stood. Kircheis smiled up at him, a real smile this time, and Martin nodded and headed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Twenty minutes later, they were bundled up in their coats and walking to a nearby pub that Martin liked, about a kilometer away. It was dark and cold, with snowflakes drifting down to land softly on Martin’s black toque, glistening like little stars each time they passed beneath a streetlight. The sidewalks were mostly empty, though cars rushed by, so they could speak freely without being overheard. Martin nudged Kircheis’s arm as they went.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re paranoid, you know that?” Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Kircheis said. “But that’s better than being careless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s true.” He scuffed at some of the snow on the ground with his toe. “What was it that you wanted to talk about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing too specific,” Kircheis said. “I still think it’s better if I don’t talk about details.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin nodded, silent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just have been thinking a lot, recently.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re making me nervous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, there’s nothing to be nervous about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis glanced around the street again, just confirming that they were alone. “You know I love you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aw,” Martin said, interrupting him with a smile. Kircheis didn’t mind, but he continued.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do. I think it started because you always knew exactly what you wanted the world to look like. You know what’s right, and you don’t let anything stand in your way of chasing it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re flattering me, Sieg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, really,” Kircheis said. “I’ve never had that kind of drive. And I really admire that about you.” He stuck his hands in his pockets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do have it,” Martin said. He frowned. “It’s not everybody who would rush in to get arrested for—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did that for you,” Kircheis said. “Not for any other reason, like ideology or convictions.” He looked away down the street. “Just for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin was silent for a long second. “I know,” he finally said. “But even so. You know what’s right and what’s wrong. You could do anything you needed to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could I?” Kircheis asked. He looked up at the sky. Some snowflakes landed, fluttering, in his eyelashes, and he blinked them away. “Will I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s this about, Sieg?” Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis didn’t say anything for a second, but in the darkness as they passed beneath a burnt out streetlamp, he reached for Martin’s gloved hand. Martin squeezed his fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh is in a position to make sure Duke Braunschweig’s daughter becomes Kaiserin,” Kircheis finally said. To forestall Martin’s objections, he added, “I know you don’t think that’s a guarantee, and I know you don’t think as highly of Captain Leigh as I do, but he really is a genius. If nothing happens to him, he will figure out a way for his side to win.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Martin said slowly, trying to figure out Kircheis’s angle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I’ll be right there with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what Captain Leigh wants the world to look like, but I’m pretty sure it’s not what Duke Braunschweig wants the world to look like.” He realized he was crushing Martin’s hand in his, so he relaxed his fingers. “And I know what you’d want the world to look like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you?” Martin asked, nudging him with his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you getting at, Sieg?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If everything goes well, I might be in a position to—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kill Duke Braunschweig?” Martin asked. “Start a coup?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Martin’s voice was light, giving voice to Kircheis’s anxieties made his stomach drop. “Or something,” he finally said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t you lucky,” Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were just a little ways away from the pub now. Kircheis stopped and turned to face Martin. “Would you ask me to do that for you? Or something like it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t just asking Martin, Kircheis realized. He was also asking Reinhard. But Reinhard wasn’t there to answer, and Martin was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin looked up at him. “And if I did?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis opened his mouth, then closed it again, looking away. “Please don’t,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are we on the same side, Sieg?” Martin asked. His voice was quiet, but there was an iron edge in his tone, the same conviction that Kircheis had fallen in love with coming back to cut as deeply the other way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope so,” Kircheis said. “I want to think so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why would it matter if I asked you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just can’t make promises, Martin. And I am worried that you’ll ask me to make one, and I won’t be able to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin frowned, his face half in shadow, turned away from the flashing neon lights advertising the pub just down the street. “You could, if you wanted to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to be able to make my own choices,” he said after a moment. “Captain Leigh told me once that if I didn’t, I’d end up places that I don’t want to be. I—” He shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And would you do what your commanding officer tells you?” Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was an uncomfortable stretch of silence. “I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did you bring any of this up?” Martin snapped. “Did you want to have an argument about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not,” Kircheis said. He was tempted to explain the letter from Reinhard, but that would only make Martin feel worse, he knew. “Things are just changing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In what way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t explain it,” Kircheis said. Martin turned away and began walking towards the pub. Kircheis took a few hurried steps after him. “Martin!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand, Sieg,” he said, but the edge remained in his voice. “Let’s get dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He managed to get back into Martin’s graces, at least a little bit, while they ate, talking about his schoolwork and other mundane things. The argument— or whatever it had been— didn’t go far from either of their minds, but they recognized it wasn’t anything that could be resolved. From the way that Martin kept sneaking glances at Kircheis’s face while they ate, it seemed clear that Martin did expect Kircheis to change his mind, when the time came for it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That night, they lay in bed, tucked under a mound of blankets as the snow spattered the window. Martin’s arm was cold as it draped across Kircheis’s side, and his forehead was pressed against Kircheis’s shoulder, his feathery hair tickling Kircheis’s back. Kircheis wound his fingers in Martin’s, making him shift sleepily against him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis wanted to say something to him, to find a way of closing the wound there in the quiet and peaceful bedroom, when it was just the two of them without the rest of the world reaching its hard hand in, but there was nothing he could say that would make it better. He couldn’t explain himself, and he couldn’t say the one thing that Martin would want to hear: a promise. All he could do was pull Martin’s arm tighter around his chest and press a warming kiss to his cold hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he eventually fell asleep, he felt a mix of guilt and elation to dream of Reinhard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And me?” the dream Reinhard asked, standing out in the snow. “Will you make promises for me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again, Kircheis had no answer that he could give.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>That weekend, Kircheis visited Hilde at her house. This was not unusual for him; she invited him over for lunch or dinner at least twice a month, and she stopped by his and Martin’s apartment after her schoolday ended more often than that. It was a sunny Saturday, and the snow had frozen into a hard shell over the ground. The light reflecting off of it made strange patterns on the ceiling of Hilde’s parlor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She and Kircheis sat across from each other on the couches, mugs of coffee in hand and a plate of cookies on the table between them. Her father had been home, but had needed to leave immediately following lunch to deal with some sort of urgent matter at Neue Sanssouci, so it was just the two of them. Over lunch, they had spoken about little of substance, but now that they were alone, Hilde was looking at him expectantly, knowing that he had something on his mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I ask your opinion on something?” Kircheis asked her as she nibbled on a cookie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Has Captain Leigh ever told you what his plans are, for after the civil war?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was apparently not the question that Hilde had been expecting. She straightened in her seat, and put down her coffee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she said. There was obvious conflict on her face; she opened her mouth to ask him a question, then stopped. “But if he hasn’t told me, I’m sure it’s not my business to know— don’t tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what his plans are,” Kircheis said. “I was wondering if you did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” She shook her head. “No, I don’t even know if he’d tell me if I asked. Some of the things he’s said do make me wonder, but…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did he say?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He only told me that everyone should remember that Lady Elizabeth is going to be the one wearing the crown, not Duke Braunschweig. It’s true, but I don’t know if he meant more than that.” She pursed her lips. “Does he not like the duke?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think liking him has very much to do with the way Captain Leigh sees things. Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It only seems like— even Duke Braunschweig sees Lady Elizabeth as a tool— if he thinks that she will have all the power, where does that leave the duke?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis took a sip of his coffee to try to cure the suddenly dry feeling in his mouth. “I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose he wouldn’t say anything like that to you. You work for Duke Braunschweig, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wouldn’t want to put me in danger by knowing what his plans are,” Kircheis said. It was a startling mirror to the way he felt about Martin. Knowing anything that Martin was thinking would put them both at risk. Kircheis had the sensation that he was in a dark room, reaching blindly for someone to follow, but they were all walking away from him as quickly as they could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s nervous,” Hilde said. “Are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About when the Kaiser dies? Of course. How could I not be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t like to see him be nervous,” Hilde admitted. She smoothed her hands over her pants. “I wish he didn’t feel like he has to keep everything so close to his chest.” She looked at him. “Has he told you any of his plans for Braunschweig’s fleet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Some,” Kircheis said. “I do research for him, and he trusts me with that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to ask—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re sound plans,” Kircheis said. “If Duke Braunschweig follows them. I think he’ll win.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde relaxed a little. “Good. I trust your judgement on that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What, Sieg?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked at her, and then he just smiled. “I wish I could show them to you, Fraulein Hilde.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate that,” she said with an answering smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he couldn’t keep things lighthearted for long. “If you had your way, what would you want things to look like, when all of this is over?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde frowned in concentration. “I want everyone I know safe,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aside from that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“With Lady Elizabeth on the throne?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that’s what you want to see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think…” She picked up her coffee and took a sip. “We should sue for peace with the Alliance,” she said finally. “I think everything else can follow after that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis nodded. It was a practical suggestion, given that even the shortest civil war would leave the country vulnerable if they didn’t sign a peace treaty, but it was an almost apolitical one. Hilde had her own reservations about politics, or at least about voicing them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope we can,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want things to look like?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Kircheis admitted. He frowned and looked out the window. “I like to think that I want the same things that Captain Leigh wants, or that Martin wants.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin is an idealist,” Hilde said shrewdly. “I love him, but he is.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not a bad thing to be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A better thing to be is a person who can make plans and follow them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis took a sip of his coffee. “There’s good reason that Martin doesn’t talk to me about anything other than ideals.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you worried about him?” Her voice was softer now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How can I not be?” Kircheis asked. He rubbed the back of his neck. “If he puts the wrong foot out of line, and he might be planning to, everything is going to come down on him. I try to be careful but there’s only so much I can do for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s this all about, Sieg?” she asked. “Is he in trouble?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “Not that I know of, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sighed, then looked at her, really looked. She sat still under his scrutiny, except for the coffee dregs that she was tipping back and forth in her cup. “I can trust you, Hilde,” he said finally. It wasn’t a question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes widened, but she nodded. “If you want to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t quite look at her. “I don’t think I have anyone else I can talk to like this.” He picked up a cookie and thought about eating it, but ended up just squishing it between his fingers. “I got a message from an old friend of mine, the other day,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was my next door neighbor, but his family fled the Empire when he was ten.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did you get a letter from him?” She was leaning forward, curiosity always one of her strongest drivers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a long story. It came through the embassy on Phezzan.” He shook his head. “It doesn’t really matter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what did he have to say?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing,” Kircheis said. “Just hello.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She raised her eyebrows and said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Kircheis said. The cookie crumbled to dust in his hand, and he ruefully tried to get the crumbs onto his little plate instead of all over Hilde’s couch and floor. “When we were little, I promised to help him. I think— well, Rear Admiral Bronner thinks that because he’s reaching out to me now, he wants to try to use me as a spy, or a tool.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It must have been some promise that you made.” Hilde’s voice was carefully neutral.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We were kids,” Kircheis said. “But he was always so sure of himself, and that made me sure of him.” He smiled, a little wry. “I think he still is sure of himself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t be telling me this if you were planning to spy for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” he said. “I wouldn’t be.” He looked out the window at the sparkling snow on the ground. “Rear Admiral Bronner wants me to spy on him— to be a double agent.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you won’t do that, either?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was quiet for a long moment. “It’s not really about that.” He shook his head. “It’s Martin, too, and Captain Leigh. I—” He hesitated for a long second. “I don’t know if my friend who wrote to me does want to use me for anything. I hope he doesn’t. But I know Martin would.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde looked at him silently, waiting for him to continue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s less about what I want and more that if he tries to do that, it won’t end well for him,” Kircheis finally said. “I worry about him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t trust him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. He closed his eyes. It was easy to admit things to Hilde, easy to say them aloud. “I can’t trust him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or your friend on Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Hank?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do trust Captain Leigh,” Kircheis said. When Hilde didn’t say anything, he opened his eyes to look at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was funny. Leigh would probably go out of his way to make sure Kircheis didn’t feel like he was bound to obey him, and yet Leigh was the one Kircheis would have followed with the least hesitation. He didn’t say that to Hilde; she understood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you,” Kircheis said. “I trust you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you trying to ask my advice?” she asked, looking away and sounding uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’re willing to give it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Sieg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What should I say back to my friend?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want to say to him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing that I could ever put in a letter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you feel like you understood what he was trying to say to you?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Kircheis said. “I think so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then say something that he would understand. It doesn’t have to be long, and it’s probably better if it isn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded. “You’re right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kircheis found Leigh in his office on Monday morning. Leigh was half asleep still, his thermos of tea tilting dangerously in his hand as he looked at something on his computer with bleary eyes. He didn’t greet Kircheis with any formality when he came in, just waved at him to sit, and Kircheis did, silently, until Leigh seemed to come to his senses enough to recognize that it was Kircheis sitting there in front of him, and that he ought to do something about that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you need something, Kircheis?” he yawned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’re going to send a reply to Muller, I figured out what I want to say to Reinhard, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This woke Leigh up, and he leaned forward, putting his thermos down with a clank amidst the mess on his desk. “I’m glad you thought about it. Do you have a letter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “I think it’s better if we don’t have too much contact.” It was a difficult admission, a painful one, but Leigh nodded and just reached for a pen and paper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it that you want to tell him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just say, ‘I’m doing what you said to.’”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh wrote it down. “Rear Admiral Bronner will ask you what you said that you were going to do,” he cautioned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he asks me, what should I tell him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Reinhard told me to join the fleet,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He already knows you’re in the fleet, so there wouldn’t be any need for you to tell him that,” Leigh pointed out. “Bronner won’t like that answer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay. I’ll include this when I write back to Muller,” Leigh finally said. He studied Kircheis. “Are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel like I should ask you that, sir.” The dark circles under Leigh’s eyes were only growing deeper by the day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine, Kircheis,” Leigh said. It felt unusually sharp, an end to any further questioning from Kircheis. Kircheis nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that was all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh smiled at him, an expression that made it all the way to his eyes. “I’ll get that letter written and passed along.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir.” Kircheis stood to leave, and Leigh turned back to his computer and thermos of tea. When Kircheis was at the door, he hesitated and turned back. “Captain Leigh,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you remember that time we went to Josef’s, and talked about ambition?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.” Leigh’s voice was soft and hesitant. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not here because I’ve been pushed into things,” Kircheis said. “And I’m not going to be.” He met Leigh’s eyes, though for some reason it seemed like a struggle for Leigh to hold the eye contact; his face twitched and his gaze flicked away and back again. “We have the same ambitions, so whatever it is you need from me, I am your loyal—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Friend,” Leigh finished, cutting him off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis wasn’t sure how to respond to that. “Yes, sir.” He wished he hadn’t said anything.</span>

  <em>
    <span>January 22, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course I remember you. If I’m not mistaken, you wrote your final paper on the Spanish Civil War, which I quite enjoyed. Interesting choice of topic, though I believe I said that you could have used a narrower focus. I was too harsh in grading back then. Well, all water under the bridge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I can’t believe people are talking about me on Phezzan. I would honestly prefer that to not be the case. Working in the Embassy must be an interesting position. I’m slightly jealous, though perhaps not if you’re busy around there, which I suspect you must be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As far as the man you encountered at a party, yes, I do believe I know who you’re referring to. I… hope... that you do not have too many reasons to come into contact with him, but if you should see him again, you may let him know that his message was received very happily, and that, quote, “I’m doing what you said to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Speaking as your former teacher, Muller, I would advise you to stay out of it. For your own sake. I’m sure you understand very well the reasons why. I appreciate whatever instinct moved you to be a messenger, but— you know what? I have no room to talk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I wish I had had you in my strats course, but you had already graduated by the time I started teaching it. I would have referred you to one of my core principles, which is to carefully choose what engagements you fight. The same principle can be broadly applied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’m still talking about it, aren’t I?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As for my promotion, some would say it’s undeserved, and some would say it’s long overdue. You’re right that I miss teaching at the IOA. I liked it. Braunschweig isn’t so bad, if you know how to deal with him, and I think his daughter is delightful. Takes after her mother rather than her father, which I think is something of a blessing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I hope you are also doing well. Another piece of teacherly advice: Phezzan is a unique place; I’m sure you don’t need to be told to learn as much as you can while you’re there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>V/r,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Captain Hank von Leigh</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>February 12, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Dear Captain von Leigh,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I must admit that I’m a little surprised to hear back from you, especially so quickly. I’m very glad it’s not too much of an inconvenience for you to speak with a former student. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I did have a minute to chat with my fellow student’s friend in a park the other day. He seemed well, but I doubt we’ll have much opportunity to talk again. Phezzan’s a big place, and if you run into the same person over and over, you begin to get the feeling that they’re chasing after you, which can get uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I appreciate all your advice, honestly. I feel like I am learning so much here. It’s unavoidable on this planet to pick up a bit of interest in business. At least in the capital, that seems to be all Phezzanis want to talk about. I’ve been reading this blog on the subject [attachment] — you may find it of interest. I’ve actually met the author— Marian Evans— but that’s just a pen name, of course. I suppose I must respect their anonymity! </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it’s ironic, I feel like I’m learning less about the Alliance and Phezzan than I am about my own country, despite being so far from home. You would think that Phezzanis wouldn’t care so much about all the gossip about the royal family, but they do. Perhaps since they don’t have the fear of being charged with lese majeste, they’re more willing to say salacious things. I’m never sure how much of the rumors I should take as true or not, especially when they’re so far removed from the source.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In any event, I am keeping myself very busy. You’re right that the Embassy is never a quiet position. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though I hear he’s been sent to the front, if you should happen to see him amongst the cohort of former IOA professors, please give Commodore Staden my regards. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Respectfully,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lt. Cmdr. Neidhart Muller</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>February 22, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Dear Muller,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I hope this letter makes it into your hands without too much difficulty, and that I’m not overstepping too many boundaries by opening up a second line of communication. From your last letter, you seemed to have an interest in speaking more, and more directly. I hope I’m not wrong about that. Although I would prefer it be face to face, we’ll have to make do. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I decided that it was worth the effort and expense to be able to speak with you freely. If you’re wondering how I was able to arrange for a courier service— your address is a matter of record, and as you know, I used to live on Phezzan and am familiar with the way things operate. I still have a small and untraceable amount of money that I have access to there, and this is as good of a time as any to spend it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since this is a rare opportunity for the two of us to be direct, I will be direct. I’m sure that by sending you this message through unofficial channels, you have lost whatever trust in me you had that I am operating above-board. And I’m sure you believe that I cannot trust you, either. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’m not sure what impulse it was that compelled you to pass along a message from an Alliance soldier. You were never one of my worst students, so you must know what doing something like that looks like!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, if we cannot trust each other, what can we do?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I will be as honest as I can, and you can choose to believe me or disbelieve me. This correspondence, on my end, is sanctioned by Duke Braunschweig. He believes that the opportunity to learn the Alliance and Phezzan’s plans is too valuable to waste. He wants me to make Reinhard von Musel a(n unwitting) spy, or, failing that, make you a source of information.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s obvious why he would want this done secretly: it’s an avenue to gain an advantage over Marquis Littenheim when the time comes for them to fight things out. If this were all carried out through official channels, there would be no advantage for him. And, even if he wanted to, Duke Braunschweig would not be able to order you to carry out investigations officially. He has no authority over the embassy on Phezzan. So, all he can do is ask me, and all I can do is trust you.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, I wouldn’t be surprised if you said to yourself, “I always knew that Leigh was the craziest teacher at the IOA, and I want nothing to do with him.” (Or, even, “I don’t want to pick a side in the fight over the throne; it’s not my place as an official of the crown.”) I couldn’t blame you! But— and forgive me if I am wrong— you did always seem to me to be the type of person who has an interest in, as a friend of mine once put it, peeking behind the curtain. Perhaps that’s why you were willing to reach out to me in the first place, un-sanctioned by your own superiors as it is, I’m sure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the way— I assume that Ms. Marian Evans is none other than Reinhard von Musel? You wouldn’t be sending me that blog otherwise. It was a fascinating read, either way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I won’t demand that you work for me, but I would like you to write me back anyway. If you have your own questions, it’s only fair for me to try to answer them. There’s instructions on how to contact the courier in the other file.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-Hank</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>March 5, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Captain Leigh,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I appreciate your candor, or what feels like candor, anyway. It’s difficult to tell these things over text.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yes, the blog is written by RvM.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I do have one question, and I need you to answer honestly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Who killed Prince Ludwig?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Respectfully,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neidhart Muller</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>March 10, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I would like to ask why you think </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> know the answer to that question. If you were here in person, asking me to my face, I would run around in circles talking about how we construct knowledge, and walk through all the knowledge that I might have been able to construct. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But you want a simple and straightforward answer, because for some reason you think that you will learn if I am trustworthy. The only reason you would think that would prove my truthfulness is if you already know what you believe to be the truth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I keep walking myself into a conclusion and then walking out of it. Why are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>asking </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Is it my engagement to Baroness Westpfale, and Baroness Westpfale’s associations? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>You are asking me to make quite a leap of faith, Muller. But I will make it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I hope that when your embassy caught and tortured Ingrid von Roscher at the border, and got whatever confession she gave, it did not take too long. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That should answer the question to your satisfaction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-Hank von Leigh</span>
</p><p>
  <span>P.S. Ignore the letter that you will receive tomorrow, and if you’re going to respond, don’t mention this one. I have gone to a great deal of effort to ensure that my letters to you are only being read by the people who are intended to see them, but the same cannot always be said for your letters to me.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>March 11, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If you’re asking who killed Prince Ludwig in order to determine who to support for the throne, I don’t think I have a satisfying answer for you. Some people would want to support a man who would kill the prince so that their daughter might take the throne. There is a type of person who might feel like it shows initiative.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I don’t know who killed Prince Ludwig. Who benefits most from him being dead? The two other claimants to the throne? It would be reasonable. A third party who would like to see the Empire weakened by the greatest civil war ever to befall humanity? Gods know there are plenty of those around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Let the dead bury the dead, Muller.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-Hank von Leigh</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>March 15, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Captain Leigh,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I ask because RvM told me that the Earth Church had organized his killing. This information was somewhat in exchange for allowing his (Prince Ludwig’s) wife to flee to the rebel territories unharmed. Not that I would have been able to do much to stop her, going short of causing a disaster: the rebel fleet’s Rosenritter regiment in plainclothes snatched her away just a little while ago. It was quite annoying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(What’s funny is that RvM’s sister is in the Rosenritter— they look identical. I bet he had some hand in getting her unit such an interesting assignment. I certainly wouldn’t have picked to send a bunch of dubiously loyal expats on a field trip to Phezzan if </span>
  <em>
    <span>I </span>
  </em>
  <span>were in the rebel fleet command. But maybe there’s some propaganda value in it.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Speaking of propaganda. We’re going to have to do some real work in the Embassy to keep that from becoming a full blown rumor back at home. I’ve lined up some stories to be published about her dying on Earth and this being a fake woman trying to claim the throne— I hope I don’t have to use them. By the way, if you hear anyone talking about it, let me know. Honestly, I had thought she was already dead, based on what I had heard or assumed. I was very shocked when she turned up on Phezzan. People who get exiled to wasteland planets don’t usually ever tend to see the light again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Duke Braunschweig had killed Prince Ludwig, it felt reasonable to assume that you would know. He seems to trust you, after all. Or, at least, you’re close enough to his inner circle that I feel like you would be able to tell. Because of that, I think that RvM is indeed telling the truth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I don’t know much about Duke Braunschweig, but from watching how the Earth Church operates on Phezzan, the idea of them having a plan… I don’t like it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Respectfully,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neidhart Muller</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>March 17, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hah, I’d like to think that I have that much of Duke Braunschweig’s confidences, but I doubt that’s the case. If I was Duke Braunschweig, I think I would be doing my best to take any knowledge of what happened to the prince to my grave. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything you just told me sounds extremely strange. I’m putting together a picture of our friend RvM, but it’s the most contradictory picture I’ve ever drawn. He’s helping the Earth Church take IvR to safety but telling you to sabotage their ultimate plan at the same time? I don’t understand what reasons he could have for doing that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’d love to figure out what the invisible unifying element is. There must be something— the synthesis between the thesis and antithesis. I suppose I could ask my favorite student, but they haven’t seen each other since they were children, so I doubt he’d know anything about it. You probably know much more about our enigmatic acquaintance than he does at this point.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, I’ll ask you. How much contact do you have with him, anyway? And what’s his ultimate goal?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, to gather information with a different tack, I assume you are watching the Earth Church? Just to confirm or deny the things he’s saying, at least?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-Hank</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>March 22, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh,</span>

  <span>I have no idea what his problem is. I don’t see him very often, for obvious reasons. We’re not exactly friends! I mean, aside from watching the comings and goings from the rebel fleet’s offices on Phezzan. I see plenty of him then. And I read his blog. But that’s not much of a relationship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I think his genuine goal is to destroy the Goldenbaum dynasty— he’s said as much to me. But he said that the reason he was working with the Earth Church to help Ludwig’s wife cross the border was because he felt sympathetic towards her, though he wouldn’t tell me why.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> surveilling the Earth Church, but my informant vanished. I still am watching them, as closely as I can, but I’m not able to learn as much as I would like. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re a big organization, bigger than you might think. Their membership numbers aren’t huge as a percentage of the population of Phezzan, but I think they’re surprisingly large in the rebel territories. Outside of the Empire, they’re essentially the only religious organization in town, and there’s a certain kind of person who’s drawn to that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They have more of a compelling sales pitch than the great gods, at least. It makes sense in a twisted kind of way, to want to go back to the place you came from. I mean, it still is junk, just junk that is good at getting into people’s heads.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I have to say, I don’t really like being a messenger who feels more like a pawn. I don’t know how much I can really help you.</span>

</p><p>
  <span>Muller,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, I completely understand. I don’t want to put you in a bad position, especially with your superiors over at the Embassy. I still do feel responsible for everyone who was my student, and I would hate to be the cause of trouble for you.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, as for religion, I can hardly blame people for wanting one. We all have stories that we cling to, to make sense of the world. It’s never really mattered if they’re true in an objective sense— what matters is how we use what we believe to influence our actions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’ve never been a believer in religion, but I do believe in many things that are almost as abstract, and almost as likely to be proven wrong. Somewhere in me, I do find I have hope for humanity to discover its own better nature, despite the historical record being one of us scrabbling bloody in the mud over and over again, always falling to our worst impulses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that’s the thing about belief and hope: they persist regardless of the evidence. I suppose if they didn’t, none of us would be able to get a single thing done.</span>

</p><p>
  <span>Sub-lieutenant Kircheis is my favorite student. He works in my office. I would appreciate knowing why you’re asking, after all this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-Hank</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>April 19, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sorry for being abrupt. I think that RvM is trying to send some kind of message, maybe to you? I’m not sure. We haven’t spoken, but I watch where he goes, and he’s been visiting half of the major resource extraction conglomerates here on Phezzan. I’ve done a little bit of digging (having someone follow him in and look at the sign-in sheets in the reception areas— not very high tech but it works most of the time) and he’s been using that false name— Siegfried Kircheis— to speak with them. It’s very strange, and I can’t figure out what the hell he’s doing or why.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s pretty unusual for one of the rebel fleet’s staff to go out and do something like this. I know they have a stack of Phezzani IDs that they can shuffle through, but they usually have a bunch of other stock documentation attached— we're pretty familiar with the way these look, and this does not look anything like the usual pattern. He’s being weird.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>See attached for the list of companies he’s visited. He hasn’t posted anything about it on his stupid little blog, so it has to be something he’s doing for other reasons than personal edification. He’s working overtime to do it, also, by the way. He goes to these things after he leaves the office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Is this something I should be concerned about?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Respectfully,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neidhart Muller</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>April 28, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You certainly already seem concerned, so I can’t tell you how to feel! </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’ve done some research of my own. You probably already noticed that all the places he’s been visiting are Alliance-Phezzani businesses only. There’s not a single solely Phezzani venture (or Imperial-Phezzani) business in sight. Also, the connecting link between all of these is, as you mentioned, resource extraction— but it looks like there are a few types of minerals that are common across all the groups. Gold and precious metals, of course, but tungsten, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a limit to how much investigation I can do from here, but it seems like our friend is doing some off the clock digging into his own country’s resources. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>My first, off-hand speculation is that he’s seeing if the Earth Church has a chokehold on the production of various critical resources. Tungsten is used in ship-building, and of course gold is important across electronics. If the Earth Church controlled these companies, and began squeezing, they might be able to subtly weaken the Alliance fleet. If the Earth Church were to do that, it </span>
  <em>
    <span>might</span>
  </em>
  <span> allow the power struggle in the Empire to play out for much longer than it would otherwise— if the Empire does not need to unite to fight an outside threat, our fleet could spend years eating itself alive, leaving the country in a much more favorable position for an Earth Church takeover. If the Earth Church does not believe that they can count on material support from the Alliance, that might be a strategy they’re looking into.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, again, that’s just pure speculation on my part. And perhaps if the Earth Church does control those resources, they might already be doing the same to us.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As for why he’s sending a message, that may be the reason: he’s already warned you about the Earth Church’s designs on the throne once, so he may be doing so again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You’re in a much better position to research this than I am. Let me know what you find.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-Hank</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>May 7, 486 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’m not entirely sure it’s the Earth Church. Some of these companies do have ties to it, but not all of them. Granted, I could be missing something, but unless they’ve gotten much more savvy about disguising their membership recently, I don’t think so? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>All of these companies are hiring, though, and their employment listings are only asking for Alliance citizens, not Phezzanis. It seems like he’s investigating their rapid growth. It could be that he’s concerned about the stranglehold that Phezzani capital has over the Alliance economy in general, so maybe this is a mission from someone back on Heinessen? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s stopped doing this now, so either he’s figured out what he was searching for, or somebody told him to stop being weird. Or both. Or he caught on that I was watching him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is going to haunt me until I figure it out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Respectfully,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neidhart Muller</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>
    <span>May 15, 487 I.C.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why would it be that all of these companies are suddenly hiring Alliance citizens only? I don’t see any evidence of rapid expansion of tungsten mining on their side of the galaxy. That is the kind of thing that ends up in papers on Phezzan, and I do pay attention to those.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The industry is preparing for rapid growth of some kind, but not saying a word about it. I think I have a better idea. There’s some mine opening that they absolutely do not want </span>
  <em>
    <span>us</span>
  </em>
  <span> to know about. No clue why RvM is drawing our attention to it, but I think it’s clear that the Alliance wants this to be a secret.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since Phezzani money is involved, I’d bet that this new mine isn’t somewhere in the Phezzan corridor: Phezzan wouldn’t stand for that. So there’s only one other place that it would matter for it to be. I’m going to see if Duke Braunschweig is amenable to spending some resources on what could end up being a wild goose chase.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is the first time I’ve asked him to commit money to something that doesn’t directly benefit his daughter’s claim to the throne, so I might end up shot down. I’ll let you know how it goes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If anything else pops up, do let me know. I could still be wildly off-base.</span>

  <em>
    <span>May 487 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had lied to Muller, though it was a white lie. If, as he suspected, the Alliance did have plans to build some kind of outpost inside the Iserlohn corridor, it had suddenly become absolutely vital to his civil war planning to have control of that base instead. He didn’t care about its possible tungsten output; its position on the other side of Iserlohn fortress was more valuable by far.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had originally become Duke Braunschweig’s subordinate with the promise of being able to orchestrate the capture of Iserlohn fortress. Whoever controlled the fortress would be in a position to strike a bargain with the Alliance, if it became necessary: allow the Alliance fleet through the corridor, and with their massive and fresh forces, install a regent on the throne that suited them. This wouldn’t be the worst outcome, Yang supposed, but he didn’t trust that anyone trying this would have the best interests of the Empire’s common people at heart. In order to stop things from going badly, Yang wanted to have that option in his own back pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although he had once predicted a way that Iserlohn fortress could be defeated, and with that prediction had narrowly saved the Iserlohn fleet from total annihilation, Yang did not really like the idea of attempting to capture Iserlohn himself. Although he had plenty of ideas, some of them even </span>
  <em>
    <span>good </span>
  </em>
  <span>ideas, most of them relied on subterfuge, and careful planning, and a delicate touch. All of these were qualities that he had noticed that his superior, Duke Braunschweig, was noticeably lacking in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Iserlohn fortress had many weaknesses, Yang decided. Most of them were internal, or even psychological. But it did have one physical weakness that he might be able to exploit. The fortress was meant to only prevent attacks from one direction, and the Thor Hammer, the fortress’s fleet-obliterating beam weapon, could only fire in one direction at once. A pincer attack, coming from both sides, would be the surest way of brute-force defeating the fortress. The problem with that strategy, of course, was that he would need to start off with his own forces on either side of the corridor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If the Alliance was setting up some forward base within the corridor, and he could get it under Duke Braunschweig’s control, that would serve as his second pincer point to allow an assault on the fortress. And, even if he couldn’t capture Iserlohn directly, having a further outpost than the fortress itself would allow him to put up resistance to any ships that passed through in either direction, halting or delaying anyone else’s attempts to ally with the Alliance forces.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The problem was that Yang had to hand only extremely tenuous information from Muller about this possible base. In order to capture it, he would need to first find out where it was. It was possible that the Alliance had mapped some kind of branch within the Iserlohn corridor, one that the Empire didn’t know about, that contained this base. That was likely why there was such intense secrecy around it, to allow the Alliance to truly entrench themselves on this new planet without interference.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first step would be convincing Duke Braunschweig of the potential value of this place, and getting him to send out scouts to find it— monitoring ships stationed through the corridor to detect any Alliance ships headed through bearing supplies. This would probably be the most difficult part: Braunschweig was not a man who enjoyed chasing ghosts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even after that, in order to get permission to bring his own ships out past Iserlohn and seize the base, Duke Braunschweig would need to petition the Kaiser for a charter. Even the highest nobles couldn’t simply take whatever planets they wished and declare them their own territory. This would probably alert Littenheim to the plan, and cause a political fight…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang, sitting at his desk, leaned his head in his hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, assuming Duke Braunschweig even won that fight, there would still be the actual matter of capturing the base and holding it. Forward of Iserlohn fortress, the Alliance might be willing to make it quite a spectacular battleground, like Kapche-Lanka was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he needed to tackle one problem at a time. That was the worst thing about this job, he thought— he was being asked to solve ten thousand problems that didn’t exist yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang sighed and stood, resolving to go speak to one of his least favorite people, Captain Ansbach. Ansbach was Duke Braunschweig’s aide-de-camp, or something close enough to it. Inside Braunschweig’s organization, which was crammed top to bottom with family members in nebulous roles of authority outside of their military rank, actual duties and chains of command sometimes grew hazy, and no request for resources could land on Braunschweig’s desk without it going through Ansbach first. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach and Braunschweig weren’t related— Ansbach wasn’t anything approaching nobility— but he had originated from Duke Braunschweig’s estates before he had joined the Imperial fleet, and there must have been some reason why Braunschweig trusted him, or at least gave him responsibility. Yang didn’t know by what mechanism they had originally become acquainted— he had never asked, and he doubted that either of them would ever say. It was likely that Duke Braunschweig had sponsored Ansbach’s attendance at the Imperial Officers’ Academy, from which he and Yang had graduated in the same year, both among the top ten students in the class.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although he had his own office in the official building where Yang also worked, Ansbach spent most of his time in Duke Braunschweig’s estate, at his beck and call. So, it was there that Yang headed, a portfolio with all of his gathered speculation under his arm. From his office, it was a twenty minute train ride, and then a short walk away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t think he would ever get used to the size or splendor of the Braunschweig manor, no matter how many times he visited it. Its white steps and columns dwarfed him as he shook off a misty spring rain from his umbrella and headed inside, greeted at the door by one of the many servants. They were used to him by now, but that didn’t stop them from still looking on him with vague suspicion. He wasn’t sure if that was due to his foreign appearance, or due to them knowing the way he had come to be working for Braunschweig in the first place. Either way, he was always uncomfortable in the dark, opulent hallways of the family home. Even if the overall aesthetic tastes were little different than the Mariendorf house, there was no familiarity or warmth to be found here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach had a tiny desk in a corner of the servant’s wing of his own in the house, but that wasn’t where Yang was instructed to meet him. He was instead shown into the library, and he ran his fingers over the spines of a few dusty tomes while he waited for Ansbach to appear. The rain pitter-pattered the windows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the heavy door opened after a few minutes of Yang standing alone, he expected that it would be Ansbach coming in, but it wasn’t. It was Duke Braunschweig’s daughter, Lady Elizabeth, the woman upon whose head Yang was theoretically trying to place the crown. She was as surprised to see Yang as he was to see her. He was never sure if he needed to bow to her, and he didn’t particularly want to, so he just nodded and stood with his hand twisting the hair on the back of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh,” she said, “are you here to see my father?” She walked across the long room with a purposeful stride, and dropped the book she was carrying onto the writing desk by the window with a heavy thump. She looked out the window at the drizzling rain for a second, the shadows made by the droplets on the glass streaming down her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In a roundabout way,” he said. “I usually have to go through Captain Ansbach first when I need something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do you need?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Scout ships in the Iserlohn corridor,” Yang said. “Out past the fortress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t actually expect you to tell me anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to go repeating it to other people?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t tell you, at least in the generalities,” Yang said, studying her. She was black haired and handsome like her mother, but young, a little younger than Hildegarde von Mariendorf. Her shoulders were always thrown back, her head always held high. Whatever finishing school she had been sent to had drilled that much into her, though Yang suspected that she had been an unholy terror to the other pupils: there was something in the cold way she looked at people, eyebrows furrowing in a scowl that didn’t reach her lips, that conveyed a capability— or desire— for violence, at least of a social sort. That ability, too, had come from her mother, though the desire must have come from her father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father wouldn’t.” Her tone was light, and she leaned back on the edge of the desk to watch him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father and I are different people,” Yang said. “But if everything goes as he hopes, you will be the Kaiserin one day. And even if there is the chance for peace in the galaxy within my lifetime, I don’t think anyone in the Empire is well served by having a leader who is wholly ignorant of military affairs.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m told that will be my husband’s concern,” she said, and she drummed her fingers against the edge of the desk, her thin engagement ring making a soft but intentional click.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how is Lieutenant Commander von Vering?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hans is fine,” she said. “I’ve been meaning to ask: did you have him as a student, when you were teaching?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I didn’t have the pleasure,” Yang said. He said nothing more than that. The reason he had not had Hans von Vering, the scion of one of the wealthiest families in the nation, as a student was that he had graduated from the IOA quite in the middle of the pack; Yang only taught the top ranked sections. Yang suspected that Vering had been allowed into the IOA on family name, and had attended for its prestige only. His posting in the fleet was some sort of desk job in the capital. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Similarly, his engagement to Elizabeth was of a wholly political nature, securing his family fortune for Duke Braunschweig’s use, while promising his family power in the coming regime.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Too bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang smiled. “There were plenty of students at the IOA who were glad not to have me as their teacher.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth was about to say something to that when the door opened again, and this time, it was Ansbach who came in. He took in the scene, then bowed to Elizabeth, not glancing at Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good afternoon, Captain Ansbach,” she said as he straightened. His sallow face looked even sallower in the dim light filtering in through the rainy windows, but perhaps Yang was being ungenerous to him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good afternoon, Lady Elizabeth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should get out of your hair, so that Captain Leigh can ask you for his scout ships in the corridor.” She straightened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome to stay, Lady Elizabeth,” Yang said, before she could start heading to the exit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I?” It wasn’t quite a question, and when she looked at Ansbach, it wasn’t for approval, it was gauging his reaction. Ansbach always had the same tight lipped expression as he did now. “I don’t think I am.” She nodded to Ansbach as she passed him en route to the door, and then left without a backwards glance at Yang, the door closing behind her with a heavy thump.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A teenage girl, out-maneuvering the untouchable Hank von Leigh,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Yang asked. He sat down on one of the couches, but Ansbach didn’t take a seat, instead wandering across the carpeted floor, not quite pacing. Yang followed him with his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duke Braunschweig would not appreciate you using her approval or disapproval to sway me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t trying to get her on my side. It’s not like I’m here to argue with you.” He ran his hand through his hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what was the point of that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If she’s going to run the country, she should know something about how,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach scoffed. There was very little they could say on the subject without wandering into dangerous territory, so he said, “What did you really come here for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exactly what she said. Scout ships in the Iserlohn corridor, past the fortress.” Yang held out his portfolio full of evidence, and Ansbach made him wait with his arm outstretched for a long second before he walked over and snatched it out of Yang’s hand. As he flipped it open, Yang explained, “My informant on Phezzan has told me that the rebel fleet is building some kind of tungsten mine somewhere in the corridor. The mine isn’t important, but to take Iserlohn, we need our own outpost on that side of the corridor. Seizing the mine under the pretext of wanting the tungsten profits will give us a foothold. We just have to find it, first.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach was silent for a long time as he shuffled through the papers, combing them over. Kircheis had been the one to prepare this report, and Yang had appreciated his thoroughness. He didn’t have much doubt that Ansbach would understand the value in the proposition— for all that Yang had defeated him in war games as a student, Ansbach </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> talented— but Yang was sure that Ansbach would like nothing more than to sabotage Yang’s plans and position.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How lucky for you that this critical piece of your Iserlohn strategy has fallen right into your lap,” Ansbach said, dropping the portfolio down on the coffee table in front of Yang. “You don’t have an alternate plan, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked up at him. “I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you needed to know it, I would tell you.” He kept his voice even. “I have plenty of ideas for other eventualities. But this is a simple solution, and if we can make it work, it’s one that Duke Braunschweig will like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Committing ships to something your spy on Phezzan thinks is happening? I don’t think so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I agree he won’t like that,” Yang said. “But if there is something there, something he can put his hands on— he likes physical resources. And a well positioned planet that can be dug for profit even after the war…” Yang trailed off and shrugged, then looked away. “You know it would be easy to convince him, if you don’t try to stab me in the back here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think I would?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. “We’re not schoolboys anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach let out something that might have been a laugh. “You’re usually blunt enough to ask if I have more loyalty to the duke or hatred of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When you ask a question where there can only be one answer, be it true or a lie, you don’t learn much from it.” Yang stood, pushing up from the couch with his hands on his knees. “Are you going to pass along my request?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I didn’t, I’m sure you’d find a way to ask him yourself.” His lip curled. “I appreciate you going through the middleman, rather than having Lady Elizabeth petition on your behalf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I didn’t have to go through you, I wouldn’t.” He looked at Ansbach steadily. “If we were friends, I’d give you advice about that.” He would have never wanted to be in Ansbach’s position. It seemed more than a little dangerous to be too indispensable to Braunschweig.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good thing we’re not,” Ansbach said. He edged away from Yang’s gaze and picked up the portfolio again. “You don’t have to argue your case with me, but you’ll have to be prepared to fight it with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even you can see that this is a good strategy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Ansbach said. “But I want to see you fail on your own merits.” It seemed more likely that Ansbach understood that he would lose his favored position with Braunschweig if Braunschweig caught him deliberately sabotaging any part of the war effort, including Yang’s plans, and so could do nothing against him at the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad to hear we have that in common, at least,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach scoffed, but returned to a businesslike tone as he gestured with the portfolio. “I’ll pass this along. If he needs to speak with you about it, it will be on Friday.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>July 487 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang got his scout ships in the corridor, traveling out with one of Braunschweig’s fleets to perform a fake training exercise, then peeling off to perform their secret duties. This paid dividends far faster than anyone expected, including Yang. It was a scant month and a half later, on a sweltering early July day, that the news reached him that an Alliance supply ship had been followed through a meandering offshoot branch of the corridor, towards an inhospitable little ball of dirt: the third planet orbiting a nondescript star. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The planet was in a system that Imperial starmaps had no name for, just a string of numbers. Alliance starmaps had named all the stars in that region of space, despite them being previously inaccessible. They called the star the planet orbited ‘Cahokia’. The Alliance was much more generous with designating places with names than the Empire was— so many planets on this side of the galaxy were only named after the local noble family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cahokia would serve as a name just fine, Yang decided. There was no need to go complicating things by trying to name the star after some ancient German earthwork— after all, those names were probably already taken by some other planet in the Empire. There were a finite number of places in ancient Germany, and all the best ones had already been used up as namesakes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although he had not even been sure that the scout ships would turn up anything useful, Yang had nevertheless been sitting on a complete plan for Braunschweig to put into action. Now that he had the information brought back by the scout ships, he was quite confident in it. His plan was made easier by the report that the installation on Cahokia was tiny, probably in an attempt to keep the place undetected. If Yang hadn’t been specifically looking, that might even have worked. But as it was, its small profile was now a weakness: it would be easier to take. There were no ships in orbit, and probably only a very minimal ground force to protect the mine operation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang reported all of this to Braunschweig, standing stiff backed and sweating under his collar in front of Braunschweig’s heavy wooden desk in his estate office. Standing behind Braunschweig’s shoulder, Ansbach glared at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, sir, the mine looks easy to take </span>
  <em>
    <span>now</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but we shouldn’t wait on petitioning the Kaiser for authority to start building on the planet,” Yang said. “Every day we wait is another day that the rebel fleet could decide to increase their presence in the starzone. I’m sure there are some people looking at their unprotected investment and wondering just how long it can stay secret. If I were them, I wouldn’t…” He trailed off under Ansbach’s glower, though Braunschweig seemed in good spirits.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you’re sure that there’s no way that we could take it before petitioning the Kaiser?” Braunschweig asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang grimaced and rubbed the back of his head. “This isn’t really one of those ‘better to ask forgiveness’ situations, sir. Whatever we do will have the rebel fleet retaliating, and if that draws a big force into the corridor…” He shrugged. “You’d lose your claim on the planet after that, regardless of if it’s the rebel fleet taking it back, or the crown taking it from you. Nobody in Neue Sanssouci wants to amp up the pressure the rebels are putting on us right now. ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig drummed his heavy fingers on the desk. “And so I’m going to describe that we’re going to do exactly that: antagonize them, so that we can steal their base in the corridor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir,” Yang said. “If Muckenburger hears the words ‘rebel base’, it will become a matter for the fleet proper. You’re going to have to lie to the Kaiser and say that this is a totally unoccupied planet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re quite blase about that, aren’t you?” Braunschweig said. “I was under the impression that he trusted you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir, the Kaiser himself was only too happy to remind me, the last time we spoke, that I no longer work for him: I work for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig actually laughed at that, which made Ansbach’s scowl deepen behind him. “I’m glad you’re keeping that in mind, Leigh.” He steepled his fingers and leaned forward, elbows on his ornate desk. “Now, what lie specifically is it that I’m going to tell my esteemed father-in-law?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That you’ve been performing geographic surveys in less-used areas of the Iserlohn corridor, on the advice— which everyone should take to mean behalf— of Count von Vering, since he thinks that you should be equal partners in some new mining venture.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig was silent for a second. “Most people looking to open a mine would survey elsewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exactly,” Yang said. “If there are questions about why you chose the corridor, explain that the other frontier is overdeveloped already, and to find a new planet to mine that far away would mean having an untenably long supply chain. Things in the corridor, out past Iserlohn especially, are ripe for picking, because no one dares build where the rebels could come knocking on their door. But you’re convinced that you have the military strength and expertise to keep the mine profitable. It’s worth stationing ships in order to have such a fast access route to the center of the Empire.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t like bringing up Count Vering’s name.” Braunschweig’s face twisted in monetary distaste. Although he had agreed to allow his daughter to marry the son of the Vering family once Elizabeth had taken the throne, he had no love in his heart for them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you have to, sir. Your estates are primarily agricultural, and you haven’t shown interest in expanding into uninhabitable planets before now. But everyone knows Count Vering has allied himself with you, and is planning to tie his industrial fortune to your lands and the crown. Having a legitimate business interest will make this more believable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig thought for a second, then stood, nearly knocking Ansbach with his chair as he pushed it back from his desk. “Let’s go immediately, then, if there is as little time to waste as you say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now? To see the Kaiser?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He has lunch with Marquise Benemunde every day at twelve exactly, and then he strolls the garden when he’s feeling well. He’s usually even in a generous mood, since he has a fondness for the flowers.” Braunschweig’s smile was grim. “Bothering him then is not something I like to do often, but is occasionally justified. It would be difficult for him to refuse to see me without very good reason.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Urgency might show your hand—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Making a formal petition would give things away even more, wouldn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grudgingly, Yang had to admit that Braunschweig might be right. “Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can come. The Kaiser likes you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Braunschweig was already heading out of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heh,” Ansbach said once he had gone. “I look forward to him realizing that the Kaiser has no desire to save you any longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned and followed after Braunschweig’s retreating footsteps.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One very uncomfortable car— and then horse and carriage— ride later, during which Yang mentally rehearsed a thousand different questions he could be called on to answer by the Kaiser or by Duke Braunschweig, they arrived at the wide and imposing entrance to Neue Sanssouci. Although Yang had been here many times, having Ansbach at his side brought back his most unpleasant memories of the place. He kept wiping his sweaty palms on his pant legs, but this didn’t help him any.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig strode in like he owned the palace, and the way he looked around made Yang suspect he was dreaming of a future when he did. The staff were all very deferential towards him, but despite their bowing and murmurs of assent, they seemed to be giving Braunschweig the runaround when he asked where the Kaiser was and if he might be able to speak with him. Yang watched one of them run off down the hallway after this first request, and he saw Ansbach notice it too, though Braunschweig was oblivious. He and Ansbach made eye contact, each of them realizing that something was afoot (and realizing that the other realized) then looked away, neither saying a word to Braunschweig. They were led deeper into the palace, and not towards the gardens where the Kaiser was supposed to be having his daily constitutional.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At length, they were let into a small audience room. Servants waited at the door. Yang and Ansbach eyed them, but again said nothing. Braunschweig, who had been given a cup of tea and a plate of cookies to pacify him while he waited, sat on one of the plush velvet couches and tapped his foot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the door opened, he stood to bow, thinking it was Kaiser Friedrich, but instead it was the wrinkled visage of Minister of State Lichtenlade. Braunschweig aborted his bow immediately, straightening and frowning. Lichtenlade bowed instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good afternoon, Duke Braunschweig,” Lichtenlade said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was told that I was going to speak with the Kaiser,” Braunschweig replied, wrinkling his lip. Lichtenlade was unperturbed by his tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His Majesty is indisposed,” Lichtenlade said. “He was feeling quite ill after his lunch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s frown deepened, but he sat back down on the couch. Lichtenlade took the seat across from him. Yang and Ansbach did their best to blend into the scenery, like the servants in the back of the room, though Lichtenlade’s nose twitched in displeasure when he looked at Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m very sorry to hear that His Majesty is ill. Nothing serious, I hope?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing that a rest will not cure,” Lichtenlade said. “If there was something that you needed, I’m sure that either I can assist you, or I can pass your request to His Majesty, as appropriate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And am I not allowed to see my father-in-law as simply a friendly visit?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If this were a social visit, Princess Amarie would be accompanying you,” Lichtenlade said. “But what is it that I can help you with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig stared at Lichtenlade for a moment, who kept his obsequious expression on his face. “A charter for an inhospitable little piece of land that nobody else would ever be willing to pay good money to the crown for,” Braunschweig finally said. “Count Vering is breathing down my neck about a joint business venture, now that he thinks he has my fleet at his disposal.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig may not have been a good actor, but he was already annoyed at being faced with Lichtenlade rather than the Kaiser, so that covered up most of the falseness in his tone, though it did nothing to hide the fact that he was talking in a completely abnormal casual register.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is a matter for the colonial affairs office, then,” Lichtenlade said, not seeming to notice. “If you have a petition to make, make it through the proper channels.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Inhospitable, I said. It wouldn’t be a colony.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All land grants are handled through that office, as I’m sure Count Vering has told you, since he is quite familiar with the land grant process. You would have been wise to listen to him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig seethed. “I would like to speak with His Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His Majesty is not available, and furthermore, would not wish to grant special privileges to one citizen above another.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Special privileges?” Braunschweig asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I can assist you in any way within my legal power, please allow me to do so,” Lichtenlade said, inclining his head. “I would be happy to pass along your request to the Colonial Affairs office if you provide me the details, and this all can be worked through the proper channels.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh,” Braunschweig said, and waved his hand. “What’s the name of the place again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir. Duke Braunschweig wishes to form a mining partnership with Count Vering on planet 25571-3, just outside the Iserlohn corridor. Recent surveys of the space in that area have confirmed a navigable route, and a planet rich in tungsten, though ill suited for permanent habitation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Outside the corridor? Past Iserlohn, you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As I said, no one else would pay for this patch of dirt,” Braunschweig said. “I’m the only one who could station a force there to protect it, if the rebels came knocking.” He paused, then added, “And I wanted to start this venture </span>
  <em>
    <span>quietly</span>
  </em>
  <span>, keep it away from the papers that report on colonial affairs, so that the rebels don’t appear as soon as Count Vering’s earthmoving machines broke ground.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not the only one who could station a force there,” Lichtenlade said. “I see there are several reasons why you would be hesitant to take things through the proper channels.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s scowl deepened. “He won’t want it.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>He</span>
  </em>
  <span>, in this case, was Marquis Littenheim, the father of the other primary contender for the throne.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That remains to be seen.” Lichtenlade tilted his head. “I hope, for the sake of your business partnership with Count Vering, that he does not, because should there be a competition between you and Marquis Littenheim over the patch of dirt, as you say, His Majesty will not favor one of you over the other.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig stood, which made Lichtenlade rise as well. “If Littenheim wishes to compete with me, there are plenty of other planets in the corridor. He is welcome to make his own surveys and choose one that suits him. Or, if he has a problem with my business, he may address it with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Lichtenlade said. “And shall I forward this request to the Colonial Affairs office on your behalf?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s lips pinched. “Try to exercise discretion when you do. I don’t want it all over the papers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.” Lichtenlade gave a half bow. “And I will give your regards to His Majesty. I’m sure he regrets missing the opportunity to speak with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Until some more amenable time,” Lichtenlade said, then bowed again and headed out. As soon as he left, one of the servants standing by the door also swiftly departed, though the other remained, to watch Braunschweig huff and scowl, until they were shown out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their way out of Neue Sanssouci was delayed by Duke Bruanschweig meeting one of his extended relations in the hallway, and they stood in a dappled pool of sunlight coming in through the window to chat. Yang wandered a little way down the hall, not caring about Braunschweig’s family matters in the least, though Ansbach stayed at Bruanschweig’s shoulder, ready to take notes on any tasks that this meeting might cause Ansbach to be required to perform. Yang leaned on the windowsill, looking out over the great front courtyard of the palace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A horse and carriage was approaching at top speed, and it stopped in front of the main steps with a clatter of hooves and wheels on the stones. Yang watched as Marquis Littenheim emerged from the carriage, straightened his vest, and then began walking up the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ansbach,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deeply annoyed, Ansbach came over to see what Yang was looking at. Braunschweig gave him a weird look as he came over, but swiftly returned to talking to his relative. Yang gave a nod out the window, and Ansbach registered how quickly Littenheim was jogging up the steps, flanked by his own assistant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think we’ve been caught,” Yang murmured. “Can you go intercept that before he reaches anyone important— Colonial Affairs, Lichtenlade, the Kaiser?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not in any position to give me orders,” Ansbach hissed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang just rolled his eyes. “Or I will.” He made to start walking down the hallway, but Ansbach thought the better of it and grabbed his arm to stop him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get the duke to the main entrance. I’ll hold him there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach took off down the hall at an unseemly sprint, though when he reached the intersection he skidded to a halt and looked down the next hall to make sure no one important was in his way before he started running again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang wandered back over to Braunschweig and stood at his elbow, which he ignored. The conversation with the grey-haired relative had turned into a screed about how annoyed Braunshweig was at one of the managers of his planetary estates, and the relative was nodding along sympathetically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His phone buzzed in his pocket, and Yang pulled it out to look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ansbach: hurry</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sir,” Yang said, finally trying to get a word in edgewise, “Captain Ansbach says you’re needed in the main entrance right away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ansbach?” Braunschweig asked, and then seemed to process that Ansbach had indeed disappeared. He frowned. “What does he need me for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About our visit here—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig finally caught on to the urgency. He clapped his relative on the shoulder. “I’m sorry, Pieter, I must run. If your son wants the position, tell him to call me. We’ll see what we can arrange.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” the man said. “I appreciate it—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Braunschweig was already taking long legged strides down the hallway, with Yang jogging at his heels.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They didn’t make it to the entrance, because Littenheim had escaped Ansbach’s delay tactic, whatever it had been. They met him as he was walking purposefully and alone down the hall. Littenheim, who was slick where Braunschweig was stocky, gave a menacing smile as he saw them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You may have sent your dog to yap at my heels,” he called, “but you can’t stop me from speaking with my father-in-law.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want, Littenheim?” Braunschweig asked, stepping in front of him to block his passage. Yang, already nervous that this would come to blows, crept towards the edge of the hallway. Both nobles ignored him completely. He could see Ansbach in the distance, approaching at a more sedate pace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I want the same thing you do, Otho,” Littenheim said. He fished around in his pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper. “A charter to build a mine and small colony on planet… 25571-3, in the Iserlohn corridor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You bastard—” Braunschweig said, and took a menacing half step forward. Littenheim dipped away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The walls have ears, Otho! If you had gone directly to Colonial Affairs with business as usual instead of running so urgently to His Majesty, we could have avoided all of this trouble.” His smile stayed plastered on his face, and this only made Braunschweig step even further towards Littenheim, reaching out for his cravat, snagging his fingers on the silk, though again Littenheim stepped back. He smoothed his necktie back down from Braunschweig ruffling it out of place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want it for?” Braunschweig asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have my own business interests,” Littenheim said, rushing the words breathlessly. “I need to protect my investments. This sometimes requires me dealing with the competition.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like you dealt with the Schaffhausen family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Littenheim smiled, predatory. “Would you like to resolve our dispute that way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Kaiser isn’t going to give you that charter,” Braunschweig said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you say that. You don’t know. He may favor me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have any idea what you’re doing here. You’re in over your head.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that a threat, Otho?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you try to go to the Kaiser with this request, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Littenheim laughed. “I’m sure you’re right— His Majesty won’t favor me over you. He’s been very careful not to. But that just means I have to put in my claim as well so that there isn’t an appearance of favoritism. So, I will. And we’ll settle this between ourselves like gentlemen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re eager to start a fight with me. You’ll lose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This time, it was Littenheim who stepped forward and clapped Braunschweig on the shoulder, brushing past him. “I wouldn’t be so sure of that, if I were you. When you and I duel, and I win, I think that will make everyone reconsider just how much the odds really favor you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig tried to grab him again, but Littenheim was swiftly walking down the corridor, and Braunschweig didn’t chase him as he left arm’s reach. “You issued the challenge, so I get to choose the time and place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Littenheim called over his shoulder. “Make it sometime convenient, will you? And a big arena. I’m sure the attendance will be excellent.” And then he was gone, chuckling to himself as he went.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig scowled, and Ansbach finally made it the rest of the way down the hallway. “I will write a formal challenge, sir,” Ansbach said. “And contact your hired duelist.” </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The duel, though it was not announced in any of the papers what it was about, was the talk of the capital for the week or so leading up to it. The sums being bet were astronomical, according to Magdalena, who was listening in to all the gossip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to it, right?” she asked on Thursday night, voice crackling over the phone. She was driving— he could tell because the wind blasting through her open-top convertible made her hard to hear, despite her practically yelling into the phone. It was quite late, so he wondered where she was going to or from. Probably some party. It didn’t matter— he was happy to talk to her on her drive. He was in bed, his phone on the pillow beside him, staring up into the dark ceiling of his bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to go,” he said. “Ansbach said that all of Braunschweig’s officers in the capital are required to attend. It’s supposed to be a show of strength, but I’d think he wouldn’t want me…” He trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great,” Maggie said. “I’ll see you there, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re coming?” Yang asked. “Why would you want to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I not allowed to love bloodsport as much as the next man?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nobody’s going to get really hurt. These are professional duelists,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s the social event of the summer. The year, even. Everyone really is looking at it as a forecast of who will claim the throne.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be superstitious.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t help it, darling.” She laughed. “Men are coming to revel in superstition and gossip, and women are coming to gape at bloodshed. The fainting in the stands will be spectacular.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t see it, but I’m rolling my eyes right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Besides,” Maggie said, “it’s an excuse to see you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need an excuse for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She just laughed at him. “I should have said, ‘an excuse to drag you out to dinner after.’”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And eating takeout at my place or at your house with your mother isn’t good enough for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shhhhh,” she said, still laughing. “At the very least, you have to admit that having me there will save you from boredom.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That has always been true,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It makes me happy to hear you say it.” Her brakes screeched as she presumably pulled up outside her destination. “I’ll talk to you later, Hank!” she said. “I’ve gotta run.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have fun,” Yang said. And then she hung up, leaving his bedroom in a sudden, empty silence. He rolled over and shut his eyes, intending to fall asleep, since he had to get up early the next morning. But the quiet of his small apartment weighed on him, and he found it impossible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although, months ago, he had been conflicted about proposing to Magdalena, once he had done it, he had realized it was the correct decision. Now, although he was dreading the event itself, which they had set a date for, he almost wished they could simply already be married so that he could stop existing in this strange stasis. It was just one more thing in his life that felt like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop, waiting for his entire life to change. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could have asked to push the date up. Magdalena certainly would have agreed. If he called her back right now and asked if she wanted to go to the courthouse tomorrow, she would have said yes, he was sure of it. Or he could move into her house at any time, and it wouldn’t even be that much of a scandal, and she would find it entertaining. He wouldn’t do any of that, of course.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After sweating, tossing, and turning for a while, completely unable to sleep, he got out of bed and opened a beer, leaning on his elbows on his windowsill to drink it, listening to the summer wind rustle the trees. It was a beautiful, peaceful night, but that did little to soothe him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could admit that he was lonely.  Reuenthal and Mittermeyer were both still operating out of Iserlohn, and he hadn’t seen either of them since the winter, which didn’t help any. But that wasn’t the entirety of the problem. It was the loneliness that came from keeping secrets— he was the only one who held the whole sum of his civil war strategy in his brain, despite handing pieces of it to many other people— that was pressing on him, more than simply being physically alone. He had thought, after so many years of secrets, that he would somehow be used to it, but that was not the case.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The anxiety about the future fed his loneliness, and the loneliness fed his anxiety. It was a vicious circle, each trouble chasing the other’s tail, but he didn’t want it to stop, because he knew when it did, that would be the end. Of what, exactly, he couldn’t put a name to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Reuenthal were here on Odin, he wouldn’t have to stand here drinking to fall asleep, that was certain. But for Reuenthal’s sake, he was glad he was off on Iserlohn with Mittermeyer. Yang made himself content with that knowledge. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, he would stand here and drink a beer or two more, until his thoughts stopped twisting round like snakes in his mind, and he stumbled his way back through his too-hot apartment and draped himself across his bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The day of the duel was sweltering. Yang wore his uniform, because he had come as part of Braunschweig’s cohort of officers, but the black fabric trapped the heat next to his body, and it was a wonder that he didn’t pass out under the hard glare of the sun’s beady eye. Magdalena fluttered her fan at his face as they sat in the stands, and Yang wasn’t sure if she was trying to be comedic or actually trying to help. In her light blue summer dress, she was far more suited to the weather than he was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On Yang’s other side, Kircheis was similarly suffering. The final seat in their short row, near the top of the stands overlooking the arena, was for Hilde, but she had volunteered to buy their group drinks and so had vanished into the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long until the main event?” Yang asked Kircheis, as he was the only one of the four of them who had remembered to pick up a program. As duels were usually over very quickly, but drew a large betting crowd, the arena owners liked to pack the day full of as many events as they could conjure, with the bigger drawing matches near the end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just three more,” Kircheis said. “All of them pistols, and shouldn’t go to swords.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank goodness,” Yang said, and wiped his face on his sleeve. His hair was clinging to his face with sweat. Kircheis had a sunburn blooming across his nose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang craned his neck to look around for Hilde. “I hope Hilde doesn’t miss it if she wants to see it. It’s taking her a long time to get drinks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Patience is a virtue, Hank,” Magdalena said, tapping his nose with her fan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think she cares about dueling that much,” Kircheis said. “When I mentioned I was required to come, she asked if I wanted company. But she has been gone a while. You don’t think she’s having trouble, is she?” Kircheis asked, looking around at the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though everyone had started out the day yelling and cheering, now the whole assembly was melting into their hard plastic seats under the heat, and the emotion of the day had turned from the elation of a day out to a simmering restlessness. The losing duelists were jeered as they walked off to tend their wounds, and it wasn’t the winners who were cheered, but the money that was won. The only real winners in every duel were the bookies, who sat in their shaded booths and were paid regardless of the outcome.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Trouble?” Magdalena asked. “You be the judge of that. It seems to me that it was neither you nor the duel that she really came here to see.” She pointed far down and across the stands, towards the VIP box where the Braunschweig family was sitting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that Yang’s attention was directed there, he could see that Hilde had abandoned her quest to get drinks, and was instead leaning on the side of the box, over the railing of it, having some sort of talk with the young Lady Elizabeth. Elizabeth’s parents were oblivious to this, or uncaring. Princess Amarie was fiddling with her parasol in an attempt to block as much of the sun as possible, and Duke Braunschweig was deep in conversation with a man sitting behind him, probably one of his many relatives, though Yang couldn’t see his face well enough to recognize him from here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang sighed, then fished in his pocket for his wallet, and handed Kircheis a twenty mark note. “Can you get us all drinks, sub-lieutenant? I’d better go make sure…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said. He headed off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to leave me all alone, Hank?” Maggie asked, batting her eyelids.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone’s got to save our seats.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed at him, and Yang squeezed his way past her and through the crowd, making his way down to Hilde. The route down to the VIP section took Yang through the closed off interior of the arena, past the bookies. It was marginally cooler in there, with great fans blowing air in a steady stream through the concrete hall, and Yang took half a moment to stand in the shade and take a few deep breaths, leaning on the cool stone wall and closing his eyes. He would go fetch Hilde in a moment, but he needed to gather his strength first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, the sounds of an argument reached him, and caused him to crack open his eyes at the familiar voices raised in a spat. The heat had raised the tensions to a breaking point, even among Braunschweig’s closest subordinates, it seemed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Down the hall, near the wall of bookie booths, Captain Ansbach and Baron Flegel were engaged in an argument. Ansbach was trying to stop Flegel from heading to the bookies, cash in hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir,” Ansbach said. “Duke Braunschweig was explicit that none of his staff should bet on the outcome of his match.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That obviously does not apply to me,” Flegel said. “If my uncle has instructions for me, he would tell me directly, rather than sending his lapdog.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir, you are a vice admiral under Admiral Braunschweig. The instruction pertains to you as much as it pertains to his lower staff.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you are a captain, and in no position to be giving me orders.” When Ansbach refused to yield, Flegel bared his teeth. “You are out of line, Ansbach. Don’t get confused as to what your station is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t think Ansbach was going to win this argument, and if he kept trying, it was going to end badly for him. And Ansbach, for all his flaws, was a more sensible right-hand man for Braunschweig than anyone else in his camp, especially his nephew. Yang had no desire to watch Flegel flex his familial privilege to have him dismissed. He let out a sigh, then plastered a smile on his face and wandered up to the argument, pretending to be guileless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach glared daggers at him as he approached, but Yang ignored him completely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baron Flegel,” Yang said. “Putting in a last minute bet on the Ferox-Wilhoff match, I see? 5:1 is pretty good odds on Ferox, but I’m not sure I’d put money on it.” The disgusted look on Flegel’s face was almost satisfying. Yang rubbed the back of his head and kept talking. “I suppose I don’t know very much about dueling, so I couldn’t say if the underdog has a chance to win. Princess Amarie was looking for you, by the way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What for?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang splayed his hands. “Do you think she’d tell me? She might just want you back in your seat so you don’t miss the big show. There’s only two more matches.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel narrowed his eyes, but turned on his heel and stomped off. Yang’s shoulders slumped in relief, though he was sure he was in for it when he went to retrieve Hilde and Flegel discovered that he had just been lied to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t need your help,” Ansbach spat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. “It’s not worth risking your skin over something like this. But by all means, if you want me to let Flegel, or any of his relations, stomp on you next time, just let me know, and I will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach just shook his head. “You should worry about yourself before anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hah,” Yang said. Ansbach had probably meant it as half a threat— his voice was cruel and his lips were twisted— but Yang couldn’t help but respond with as much of a genuine smile as he could muster, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly. “If I was good at doing that, I certainly wouldn’t be here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach looked at him in disgust, then turned away without another word, leaving Yang to shove his hands into his pockets and work up his remaining resolve to fetch Hilde from the VIP section. This turned out to be unnecessary, because just as he headed towards the lower exit of the hallway, she entered it at a trot, pushing through the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fraulein Mariendorf!” Yang called, getting her attention. Her head snapped up, and she jogged over, looking a little chagrined.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you looking for me?” she asked when she made it to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew where you were,” Yang said. “Though I was coming to fetch you. I think it’s best to get some distance from the VIP corner during the actual duel. There’s no way that it will stay calm, win or lose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Hilde said. “Sorry that I got distracted and didn’t get drinks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I sent my deputy to get them,” Yang said. “I’m sure he’s already back and wondering where we’ve vanished to.” He nudged her with his elbow. “We’d better get moving so he doesn’t think we disappeared.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you talking to Lady Elizabeth about, if I may ask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing,” Hilde said. “I just wanted to say hello.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She frowned. “It’s fine, right?” Her voice was on the borderline between being defensive and seeking reassurance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked over at her. “Hunh? Oh. Well, she could use some friends,” Yang said. “And if she counts you as one of them, I can hardly think of a better one for her to have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded. The emerged back into the blistering sunlight, and it took a moment of shielding his eyes and looking around before he spotted Kircheis and Magdalena. Kircheis was struggling to hold three large cups full of foaming beer, while Magdalena was waving at Yang and Hilde with her fan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Over the loudspeakers, the announcer was saying that one of the matches had been canceled, and that the Braunschweig-Littenheim duel was moved up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sounds like we’ve made it just in time,” Yang said. They found their seats, and Yang gratefully accepted his beer from Kircheis. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there a reason Baron Flegel keeps looking over here, Hank?” Magdalena said, gesturing down the stands with her fan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes,” Yang said. “I annoyed him a few minutes ago. He’ll get over it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena laughed. “I hope so, for your sake. I am going to have to invite him to the wedding, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang grimaced. “Please don’t joke about that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not joking! When would I ever joke about such a thing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he and Reuenthal are in the same place, it won’t be pretty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s very sweet that you think he’ll come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned into his beer, but his attention was diverted from his own troubles by the cheer that rose from the crowd as the two duelists walked out into the arena. Yang consulted Kircheis’s pamphlet in an attempt to remember their names— Charlie Wurtz and Marc Ackner. They were dressed in outfits much finer than the many previous duelers that Yang had barely paid attention to. They were decked out in the Littenheim and Braunschweig family colors, respectively, making them easier to identify at a distance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This one will go to swords, for sure,” Magdalena said. “The past couple times these two have faced each other, they have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Braunschweig and Littenheim haven’t dueled before, have they?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not recently, but these are hired duelists who matched up when other people contracted them,” Magdalena explained. “Didn’t you follow dueling as a kid?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “Nobody I knew liked it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you said you were on your school’s fencing team,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s different.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, when I need someone to defend my honor, I’ll hire you as a duelist,” Magdalena said, and she swished her fan like a sword.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was spared from having to respond to that by the action down below picking up. The duelists, having checked each others’ weapons, bowed to their sponsors, and then lined up. The announcer counted down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t look at the arena, and instead busied himself with drinking his beer. Magdalena leaned forward in her seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s going to win this, Maggie?” Hilde asked, squeaking in the question right before the count reached one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a clue, but that’s what makes it exciting, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was still looking down at the pamphlet when the four pistol shots rang out, sounding in such close succession that they almost couldn’t be distinguished from each other. The crowd roared, and Yang looked up to see what the status was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Littenheim’s duelist had been hit in his right shoulder, and was wincing and clutching it. Braunschweig’s duelist had been clipped in the leg, but it looked like a shallow wound, and he was standing on both feet, the blood just staining the white calf of his trousers crimson, and dripping down onto the sandy arena floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Braunschweig’s duelist was calmly being handed his sword by his second, Littenheim’s duelist looked reluctant to stand and take his own. The crowd’s elation and excitement soured, and turned into jeers, people in the lower stands chucking garbage into the arena, while Littenheim’s duelist considered if he should yield.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn,” Magdalena said. “It was a good strategy, to go for the leg. If he had got a better hit, it would have been a fair fight. Wurtz is ambidextrous, so taking out his arm wouldn’t have done any good.” She sighed and leaned back in her seat. “Would have been fun to see it go to swords, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad it’s over,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no, wait, he’s standing up!” Magdalena said. “Littenheim would probably kill him himself if he yielded now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was clear that Ackner was not ambidextrous, from the way he initially tried to pick up the sword with his right arm, despite his shoulder being wounded. He passed it to his left hand and grimaced, lining up as the commentator announced the start of the swordfight. The two duelists faced each other, swords up, and various photographers snapped their dramatic pose before the fight began.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was over quickly. Ackner, Littenheim’s duelist, was clearly only participating as a formality, and had no hope of winning. Despite Wurtz’s leg being injured, he was faster with his sword, and more adept, and their blades only clashed a few times before Ackner ended up on the ground, with Wurtz’s blade at his throat, and he yielded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crowd was silent for a second, then rose into loud jeers and cheers. Below, in the VIP box, Braunschweig was standing up and waving to the crowd, pointedly giving a look across to Littenheim’s box on the other side. Littenheim shook his head, and then walked away, vanishing with his family into the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What would you have done if he lost?” Maggie asked. Hilde looked at Yang curiously. He hadn’t explained the cause of the duel beyond that it was about land rights, and both of them had immediately surmised that whatever the two families were fighting over was something vital to the overall strategy to claim the crown.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d figure something out,” Yang said. He scratched his head. “I still have to figure things out now. Just different things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang finished his beer. “Let’s get out of here, before everybody trying to collect on their bets starts a stampede.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>After winning the duel, as fairly as such a thing could be won, Braunschweig was given the charter to form a small outpost and mine on Cahokia-III. He was inordinately elated about this, more so than Yang had expected, given that it was an outlay of resources that Braunschweig might have been annoyed about previously. But it seemed that winning something over Littenheim had buoyed his spirits, and when he called Yang to his office to discuss the actual taking of the planet, he was practically jovial, leaning forward on his elbows and smiling broadly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand that this is a complete plan of attack,” Braunschweig said, tapping on the sheaf of papers that Yang had put on his desk in front of him. “Has Ansbach seen it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Yang replied. Ansbach said nothing, standing in his usual spot behind Braunschweig and trying to ignore the fact that Yang was in the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do you think of it, Ansbach?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It uses the minimum number of ships feasible,” Ansbach said. “It should work, but leaves very little room for error.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig turned to Yang. “We can send more than— how many ships?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Six, sir,” Yang said. “But we shouldn’t. We can’t admit that there is any rebel force on the planet, so if we sent more than is required to build a preliminary base, it would cause trouble. That many ships should be enough to deal with the rebel presence there, and if a larger rebel force comes through the corridor, it will be a fleet off of Iserlohn that will be able to oppose them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig nodded. He flipped through the sheaf of papers detailing the strategy. “And who do you propose should command?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s your decision, sir,” Yang said. “I wouldn’t presume to make it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Flegel won’t want the job,” Braunschweig said. “And can’t very well pull on anyone outside of my fleet yet…” He turned to Ansbach. “We could take Commodore Bachmeyer from Westerland, if he’d get here in time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suggest that Captain Leigh command the mission, sir,” Ansbach said, looking straight ahead. “He knows the plan better than anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang tried not to grit his teeth, but he was unable to resist jamming his hands in his pockets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm, not a terrible idea,” Braunschweig said. But then he looked at Yang’s face more closely, and said, “You’ve never had much of a command before, have you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir. Not much.” He absolutely was not going to bring up the incident at El Facil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig drummed his heavy fingers on the desk. “Ansbach, you’ll go with him. You can be in co-command. Two captains for six ships should be more than sufficient,” he said with a little chuckle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir—” Ansbach began to protest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll survive without you for a few weeks,” Braunschweig said. He picked up the papers and shuffled them on his desk. “And I’d rather have you there to make sure this doesn’t go wrong. I’ve spent a lot on this venture already. I’d like to ensure its success by putting the </span>
  <em>
    <span>right</span>
  </em>
  <span> people in command.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Ansbach said. His voice was flat again, but perhaps there was some pride in it. “I’ll make sure of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.” He waved his hand. “You should go make your preparations with Leigh, then. I’d like to get this moving as quickly as possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach and Yang both saluted, and they headed out of the office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I guess you’re stuck with me,” Yang said. “You could have just let him pull one of his officers from his estates.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If your plan gets us both killed—” He cut himself off, shaking his head, as he marched down the hall of Braunschweig’s estate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s very funny that you’re worried about me getting you killed,” Yang said, following Ansbach. “I haven’t changed that much in twelve years.” When they reached the door, where Yang was sure they would go separate ways, he tacked on, “I have to hope that you have.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t think he is going to kill you, do you?” Magdalena asked. Yang had stopped by her house after his day in the office was over, and in the cool of the evening, they were reclining on lawn chairs beneath her pavilion in her garden. The heady scent of flowers drifted through the air, and lightning bugs dotted the grass and sky, just now starting to light up as the sun finally descended below the treeline. He had finally needed to confess to her at least part of what was going on, since he was being sent off planet. She could be trusted to keep the secret.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “I’m sure he won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Yang said, and found it to be true as he said it. “He hates me, but…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But what? He tried to kill you before.” Magdalena tipped her drink in her hands, the ice cubes tinkling the glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. “I understand him. I hope I do, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena made a dubious noise. “It sure seems like he was trying to get you killed, by volunteering you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t expect me to die out there,” Yang said. “He remembers me from school well enough. If things go badly, I’m sure he thinks I’ll just run away. He wants me to fail by my own merits, and making me, and by proxy Braunschweig, look bad by fumbling the job would be an easy way to do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And will you run away if things go badly?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Yang said. “It’s not worth that much. If we can’t hold onto the planet from the rebel fleet, I’ll figure something else out. Or Braunschweig will decide I’m not worth the trouble to keep around, and he’ll send me back to Muckenburger, and I won’t have to worry about any of this anymore.” He laughed. “Can’t say I’d mind that too much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena nodded, her lips pinched and brow furrowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s the matter?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It may shock you to learn,” Magdalena said, trying to inject levity in her voice, “but it would cause me quite a number of problems if you go off and get killed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang laughed, but when she didn’t smile, he kicked his leg off his lawn chair and poked her with his bare foot. “Cahokia’s not worth anybody’s life, not even Ansbach’s. I’ll stay safe. Besides, we’ll have the upper hand there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll take your little red-headed protegee with you, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kircheis? Probably.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good. He can make sure no one stabs you in the back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or shoots me from the front.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Either way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m really not worried about Ansbach,” Yang said. “The worst he’ll do to me is give me a job I hate.” He shrugged. “He’s not—” He realized that anything he could say wouldn’t make sense to Magdalena. “We’re in the same position, almost,” Yang said. “I don’t know if we’re on the same team, exactly, but working for Braunschweig and not being part of his family— we have more in common than we lack. He probably hates that, but I’m sure he recognizes it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mm,” Magdalena said. “And you weren’t in the same position when you were students?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. The IOA is built to pit students against each other. And that worked because we were stupid and sixteen.” He shook his head. “Both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His reminiscing tone caused Magdalena to change the subject. “Will you stop by Iserlohn?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pass by,” Yang said. “There’s no reason for us to stop at the fortress. So I won’t see Reuenthal, if that’s what you’re asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed and kicked at him, her leg lazily tangling with his as they dangled off the side of their adjacent lawn chairs. “Too bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Yang said. “Maybe on the way back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed. “You’d better write him a letter before you ship out, so if you get killed on Braunschweig’s little scheme, he’ll know what happened to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s more my scheme than Braunschweig’s,” Yang said with a yawn. “But yes, I’ll tell him. And Mittermeyer, too. If the rebel fleet ends up in the corridor, it might be one of them who will have to intercept it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Magdalena said, sounding satisfied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is that good?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t ask me any questions, Hank,” she said.</span>

    <span>August 487 I.C., Within the Iserlohn Corridor</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis had been on fleet ships before during a few training exercises at the IOA, but this was the first time that he had been assigned to one, even on a temporary basis. The ship, along with all of the ships in their group, was a transport, barely even armed, and therefore relatively boring to everyone familiar with the larger battleships of the Imperial fleet. Kircheis was fascinated with its workings nevertheless. Once they left Odin, he had few official duties while en route, so he spent as much of his time as he could lingering on the bridge, trying to learn about normal ship’s operations without getting in anyone’s way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis’s usual assignment gave him little practical experience, and he wanted to get as much as he could now. He suspected that once the Kaiser died, his comfortable post in the capitol would cease to exist. With that in mind, he didn’t want to suddenly be assigned to a ship in crisis without knowing the first thing about how they ran in reality. Classes at the IOA, though they had been comprehensive, were nothing like the actual experience of being on duty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>People tolerated him on the bridge, asking questions about the operation of all of the ship’s equipment and duties. Perhaps his curiosity was welcome because, despite his officer’s uniform, he was unfailingly polite to the enlisted specialists who manned the bridge consoles, and the senior officers ignored him because of his sub-lieutenant’s lack of stripes on his shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Learning about how things worked gave him something to do, anyway. Travel was otherwise deathly boring, and he hated spending too much time in his quarters. His room on board the ship was very cramped: there was a camp-sized bed that he barely fit on, and that was it. He could stand sideways in the crack between his bed and the wall, but not face towards the door, which opened with a sliding mechanism to take up even less space. Being an officer, he at least had a room of his own. This was more than any of the enlisted men in the belly of the ship could say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though Kircheis wasn’t expecting to stay on the ship for very long, he had still taken a few steps to make it feel more like home, taping up some photographs on the wall above the little fold-down desk. There was a copy of his photo of the von Musel siblings, and then a photograph of Hilde in her IOA uniform, grinning out at the camera. A photo of Martin, sitting at the rickety kitchen table in their apartment, had the place of honor, though when Kircheis sat on the edge of the bed and looked at it, he felt an odd twist in his heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had been given the choice of coming on this mission: Captain Leigh had called him into his office and asked if he wanted to accompany him to seize the base on Cahokia-III. Kircheis remembered standing in front of his messy desk, and looking at Leigh’s serious face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to come?” Kircheis asked. He realized after he said it that it was a silly question. Leigh wouldn’t have asked if he didn’t want Kircheis to come.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only I’m allowed to answer a question with a question, Sub-lieutenant,” Leigh said with a smile. He was dodging the question, though.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re my superior officer, sir,” Kircheis said. “You shouldn’t really be giving me a choice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll mark you down as ‘no’, then,” Leigh said. There was no animosity in his voice, and he almost sounded relieved. “That was all I wanted to ask.” He waved his hand at Kircheis and looked back down at his computer, frowning in concentration.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir,” Kircheis said. “I want to come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh looked up. “Alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They looked at each other in silence for half a second— it was a weird, strained moment. “I—” Kircheis began, then stopped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh smiled. “I’m being selfish in wanting your company, Kircheis. And since I wanted the company of a friend, rather than the obedience of a subordinate, I was asking you as one. That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis, thinking of the way that he sometimes saw Captain Ansbach look at Leigh, nodded. It would have been unpleasant to be surrounded on all sides by enemies. “Thank you, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh studied him for a second, then shook his head. “You shouldn’t thank me, Kircheis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That had been the easy conversation of the day. Telling Martin that he was being deployed out into the field had been much harder. It would have been better if Leigh hadn’t given him a choice, if Kircheis had not had to face Martin with the knowledge that he had </span>
  <em>
    <span>volunteered</span>
  </em>
  <span> to head out to the front, to fight and maybe die. Kircheis studied the photo of Martin on the wall, and tried not to think about Martin’s cold scowl when he had broken the news. He hated leaving on an argument, but with Martin, there would be no other way that he could leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis checked the time. He couldn’t sit around dwelling on Martin right now. In about ten minutes, there would be a command meeting to discuss the actual plan of attack, since they were coming close to the planet, having already passed by Iserlohn Fortress. They were now creeping through relatively empty and barely charted space, with the dot of Cahokia starzone gleaming on their navigational charts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a final glance at the photographs, Kircheis heaved himself to his feet and shuffled sideways out of his room, then strode through the cold ship’s hallways to the meeting room. It was already full of the junior officers and NCOs who had been pulled to staff this mission, talking among themselves. As one of the most junior of the junior staff officers, and not knowing anyone in this battalion, Kircheis was thoroughly ignored as he found his seat. Captain Leigh and Captain Ansbach, sharing command, had not arrived yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach arrived right at the scheduled time, and Leigh showed up about thirty seconds later, earning himself a scowl from Ansbach, who called the room to order before Leigh could even get to his seat at the front.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room quieted down to listen to Ansbach. Compared to the way that Kircheis remembered Leigh delivering his lectures, Ansbach was stiff and unfriendly when he spoke to the assembled staff, looking out over the tops of everyone’s heads. He began with the schedule.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you are aware, we are just two days out from our target. As soon as we enter the starsystem, we must assume that a clock has begun ticking, one which will summon the nearest contingent of the rebel fleet down on our heads. We cannot assume that we will be able to enter the system and land on the planet undetected, though we are going to try. As such, speed and timing will be of the utmost importance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Our goal is to overtake the rebel base on this planet, before the rebel fleet moves into the corridor to protect their asset. We need to establish Duke Braunschweig’s control of the planet, without the assistance of the broader Imperial fleet. Any engagement within the corridor does not concern us on the ground today, even if in the future ships will need to be permanently stationed in the starsystem. Removing the rebel fleet forces on the planet’s surface is the only thing that Duke Braunschweig requires.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To reduce our chances of being detected, we will attempt to take advantage of this planet’s features. The rotational period is very short, meaning we will have only a short time before we lose the cover of darkness. Sandstorms, which are frequent on the surface, will provide us cover for our descent. They reduce surface visibility to almost zero, and will impede radar detection. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We will be able to make a direct landing during a moderate intensity storm, but aerial navigation will be difficult. As our ships are only minimally armed, due to the nature of the mission, we will land and then proceed to capture the rebel fleet base with ground troops. Our starting position will be in these highlands, close to the known location of the rebel fleet base.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He continued to explain the details of the plan, the navigational route that the tanks would follow, the way they would approach the base, and the logistics of supporting this deployment on a planet that had an unbreathable atmosphere. The plan was almost exactly as Captain Leigh had written it, so Kircheis was already familiar with its details. He paid attention, and took notes on the places where Ansbach mentioned deviations from Leigh’s ideas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Once we have captured the rebel base, we will relocate our ships to just outside the mine, here. Since this will need to be accomplished quickly, Captain Leigh will be remaining with the ships to coordinate the change of position, as well as any resupply or fallback we may require,” Ansbach said, continuing as though this was a completely normal part of the plan, and not him deliberately cutting Leigh out of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis looked over at Leigh, who was sitting silently, looking up at Ansbach’s presentation without a flicker of annoyance on his face. He was merely weaving a pen back and forth through his fingers, the notepad in front of him completely blank. Kircheis was having a harder time not being annoyed at Ansbach. He and Leigh were supposed to be in co-command, and Leigh had been the one to write the plan that they would be following.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach finished his presentation a few minutes later and opened the room up to questions. None of the other staff seemed concerned that Leigh had been unofficially relieved of his command, by someone who didn’t have authority to do so. All of the questions concerned logistical details that Kircheis ordinarily would have been interested in hearing the answers to, but all he could do was look across the room at Leigh, who was unperturbed by Ansbach’s behavior. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh’s lack of concern didn’t mean anything. Kircheis had seen Leigh be escorted away by armed guards out of his classroom, once, and the only thing he had said was that everyone should remember to study for their next exam. He took things in stride.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh may have been willing to allow Ansbach to push him around, to not cause a stir, but Kircheis had come with Leigh to provide him an ally, and he wasn’t going to take that duty lightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the question and answer section of the presentation finished, and Ansbach left, Kircheis slipped out of the meeting room. Leigh remained behind, speaking briefly with the gathered group of XOs from their little squadron of ships. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach was walking down the hallway by himself, and he stopped and turned when he heard Kircheis approaching at a jog.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Sub-lieutenant?” he asked. His expression was cold, but in an impersonal way. Ansbach knew that Kircheis was part of Leigh’s entourage, but his disdain for Leigh apparently didn’t entirely extend to his staff.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir, if I may speak freely, I have a question about the personnel assignments.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A question about personnel assignments shouldn’t require permission to speak, unless you are planning to be impertinent about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You and Captain Leigh are in co-command. Why isn’t he accompanying you on the mission?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach stared at Kircheis silently for a moment. “It shouldn’t concern you, but since it does, I will say that I am more senior than Captain Leigh, and staffing choices are my prerogative. It was a choice I made for the benefit of the mission. There’s no need for both of us to go, and I have significantly more ground combat experience.” He paused, looked Kircheis in the eye, and said, “And Leigh should be grateful to not be put in charge of the excursion. He’s never been good at defending himself. If that is all, Sub-lieutenant?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you dislike him so much, sir?” The words fell out of Kircheis’s mouth before he could stop them, and the tacked on ‘sir’ only felt like more of an insult. “He hasn’t done anything to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suggest you mind your own business,” Ansbach said, then turned and strode off down the hallway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis let him go. When he turned around, he found Leigh leaning on the wall, further down the hallway, outside the briefing room doors. He had probably heard the whole exchange, or most of it. Kircheis’s face heated up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s right, you know,” Leigh called.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis walked over to him. “About what, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he hated me more than he wanted the mission to succeed, he would be sending me out there and sabotaging the plan.” Leigh shrugged expressively. “I’m not going to look a gift horse in the mouth— I would have preferred not to come here in the first place, so staying with the ships is the next best thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate that you’re looking out for me, but sometimes it’s best to leave well enough alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I did ask you to come for a reason.” His smile was wry, and he tugged at his hair. “Don’t apologize.” He chuckled. “I suppose there’s probably nothing you could do to make him dislike me more, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why </span>
  <em>
    <span>does </span>
  </em>
  <span>he dislike you so much, sir? If you don’t mind me asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I’m—” He shook his head. “He used to say it loudly enough— he’d say it’s because I’m a foreigner for sure, and probably a faggot on top of that, and maybe even some bastard son, which are all terrible things to be.” He shrugged. “Easy enough to understand, so let’s leave it at that, Kircheis, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was clearly not the reason, but Leigh was loath to discuss it, so Kircheis nodded. “Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Their ships reached Cahokia-III exactly as scheduled, and took observations of the planet before approaching within the detection range of any ground sensing stations. They didn’t see any satellites, nor any rebel fleet ships lingering in the system, just the reddish, dusty ball of rock that spun unnervingly quickly on its axis. When one area in the northerly latitudes of the planet swung into the light, their most powerful scopes picked up the scar of an open pit mine, though the buildings next to it nearly blended into the terrain. If they hadn’t known what they were looking for and where to find it, they likely would have missed it, tucked in among the lumpy and misshapen ground of the planet as it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite the relatively small size of the forces that Ansbach was going to be commanding, they were still likely to be a much larger force than anything stationed at the rebel encampment, which was quite small. Considering how many workers would be needed to staff the mine, along with the size of the buildings surrounding it, there was probably at most one regiment of soldiers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although the plan was simple and well thought out, things began going wrong almost immediately. Imperial ships were designed to descend through a planet’s atmosphere and land on the ground, but the sandstorm that they were aiming to descend during was more punishing than anticipated. On their first attempt to descend, the ships were knocked so wildly off course that they had to re-ascend into space and regroup, waiting a few hours for the weather to clear slightly, and then descend during the next available opportunity. Even in a less powerful sandstorm, the ships were knocked back and forth like they were toys in the hands of a child. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis stood on the bridge and barely kept his balance as they ended up nose-down at one point, their massive gravity engine barely able to compensate for the wind’s force. Leigh seemed unperturbed, sitting on one of the bridge chairs cross-legged, watching their position change over the terrain map in front of them with his eyes half-lidded. Ansbach leaned over his own console, gripping the edge of it so hard that the heavy ring he wore scraped loudly along the metal when the ship tilted hard to port and Ansbach stumbled and clung for stability.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite the weather, this time, the ships all made it down in the same area, tucked in among the rocky highlands. Ansbach grew impatient— it took far too long for the ships to be anchored to the ground to allow for the disembarking of the tanks, and then the tanks took far too long to get out of the bellies of the ships and form neat lines, struggling to array themselves on the shifting sand and crumbling rocks of the ground beneath them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh watched all this from the bridge with his usual detached benevolence, it seemed to Kircheis. He sidled over to Leigh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So much for speed being the name of the game,” Leigh said, glancing up at Kircheis and giving him a smile. “Ah, well, I’m sure Ansbach will figure it all out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there anything I can do to help, sir?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m sure there’s not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure I like the feeling of being dead weight,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh nudged Kircheis with his elbow. “It’s good for soldiers to be idle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite this reassurance from Leigh, Kircheis couldn’t bear to watch things go poorly and just stand around, so he suited up and headed outside to help direct the tanks as they left. He had never been on a planet without a breathable atmosphere before— he had never even been on a planet other than Odin before— and it was a little unnerving. Gravity was light on this world, which made the sand fly up into the air and scatter wildly with every gust of poisonous wind that buffeted the ships. The dull red sun illuminated each grain, like snowflakes, but it was far too hot on this planet for snow. Even in his cooled suit, sweat gathered along Kircheis’s back and flattened his curls to his forehead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Admittedly, his excursion to assist ended up being more of his getting a feel for navigating the ground of the planet. As Leigh had said, there wasn’t much for him to do. But he still loped around, getting his balance in the strange gravity, and offered help where he could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could see why the tanks were having trouble. Although their treads stopped them from sinking into the loose sand like Kircheis’s feet did, they moved much more slowly than they wanted, and the way the sand buried uneven features in the rock below made several of them end up catching in sharp dips in the ground that they found difficult to clear. Still, they were well designed machines, and once the operators figured out the best gear, they trundled away in long rows. Kircheis watched them go, standing beneath the bulk of the ships, and looking at the sun crawling too-fast towards the horizon, feeling apprehensive in a way he couldn’t justify.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An eerie silence fell over the ships, once the tanks departed. The crew outside spent some more time preparing the ships for an extended stay on the planet, and Kircheis watched as the small staff that Braunschweig had put aside for actually investigating the possibility of mining the planet took some measurements of the rocks and atmosphere. It took a while, and the sun was setting by the time they finished. This didn’t mean much, considering how fast the night/day cycle on this planet was, but the darkening sky felt unnerving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis headed back inside with the rest of the small remaining support staff, and the great cargo ramps retracted back into the now-empty bellies of the ships. His footsteps echoed through the hallways, which felt barren without the hundreds of ground troops they had carried to Cahokia. The crews of the transports themselves were minimal. Kircheis was still wearing his suit, but he had taken off his helmet and was holding it under one arm. It was a pain to get into and out of, so he headed for the bridge to see if there were any tasks that might require him to go outside again, before he took it off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He found Leigh on the bridge.  Now that the chaos of everyone disembarking was over, and Ansbach wasn’t around to scowl at him, Leigh had found a perch on top of one of the consoles, and was reading a book. Even the bridge was too quiet. Ansbach’s tanks weren’t going to communicate with them by radio until they had taken the base. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How’s the weather out there, Sub-lieutenant?” he asked when Kircheis came in and stood at his side. Now that Ansbach was gone, it was clear that Leigh </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> more relaxed without him standing nearby on the bridge. His posture was loose, and he was no longer pulling at the hair on the back of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s hot,” Kircheis said. “I wish we had satellite imagery. I’d love to know if we’re going to get any more sandstorms.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ansbach knows to just stop and shelter in place if there is one,” Leigh said. “I have faith that he is not going to find himself lost in the desert.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think when he’s captured the base, we’ll move the ships into orbit? I feel like all this sand can’t be good for them.” Even as he said this, a gust of wind rocked the ship, floating tethered above the ground. Kircheis wobbled on his feet, though Leigh was stable in his criss-crossed perch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Leigh said noncommittally. “Ideally we’ll put a whole fleet in the system, so six ships won’t really matter…” He glanced up from his book at Kircheis, wearing his suit still. “But if you’re fishing around for me to give you something to keep you busy, making sure none of our systems are clogged with sand will take you” — he checked his watch— “probably until the end of this shift.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh shook his head. “I see I failed to teach you the value of laziness at the IOA.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s true, sir.” But he smiled at Leigh, and trotted off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so it was that Kircheis headed down to the engineering section of the ship, going to talk with the crew down there about how the ships would fare in the corrosive, sand-blasted atmosphere.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While he was down there, examining a computer readout monitoring the temperature of the engines, the ship was rocked by a particularly heavy gust of wind, one that slammed Kircheis sideways into the man standing next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry about that,” Kircheis said as he righted himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The enlisted man chuckled. “It’s fine. I think you’re right that we’d be better off in space than on the ground, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship wavered in the wind again, and this time there seemed to be a strange, thrumming vibration, the whole ship bouncing in some resonant frequency. “Is there any way we could put the ships on the ground, rather than keeping them in the air? That might help with all of this.” He held the console to stay steady.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’d have to ask the captain about that, sir. We certainly can land— won’t hurt the structure of the ship to be on her belly— but if we ended up half buried in sand, I’d hate to try to take off again. These ships really weren’t built for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another man jogged up through the engine room. “Hey, Mikelson—” he called, then stopped on his heels and saluted when he saw Kircheis. Kircheis saluted back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it?” Mikelson asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship shivered again, some of the vibrations becoming more severe. “One of our tethers snapped off,” he said. “That’s what’s making the shakes so bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mikelson sighed. “Damn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Looks like we didn’t bolt it in to the rock properly. Somebody’d better go fix it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You volunteering?” Mikelson asked. “Get a new wire, and a couple guys. I’ll come out with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other man sighed. “Sure, sarge,” then walked off, calling to get the attention of a few other men down in the engine room to take care of the problem with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The ship’s not going to come loose, right?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nah,” Mikelson said. “I’ll make sure they check the rest of the attachments. You all set with the engine check?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Kircheis said. “Thanks for showing me what to look for. You need anything from the bridge when you go out there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m all good.” He saluted, then headed off, leaving Kircheis to poke around in the ship’s engine computer some more, looking through all the system diagnostics. The ship kept shaking, but it wasn’t unbearable. After about ten minutes, Kircheis saw the team going out in their suits, carrying the heavy anchor between two people. He nodded at them as they passed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was absorbed in the technical readouts when, suddenly, the ship was rocked so violently that he couldn’t keep his balance, and he toppled to the floor. As he scrambled back to his feet, there was the sound of shouting from down the corridor, and an alarm began to blare. He immediately jogged to the front of the engine room to see what was happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s going on?” he asked one of the soldiers who ran past him, scrambling for the weapons cache on the side of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re under attack— the other ships—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis’s heart began to beat strangely. He accepted a rifle and axe from the weapons cache that the enlisted man opened, and by the time he had them in hand, he could hear the sounds of fighting, coming closer through the hallways from the loading bay. He imagined that whoever was trying to board had entered the ship when they dropped the ramp to repair the snapped guy wire.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Kircheis’s first instinct was to dash out into the fray, he quelled it. If the ship was being boarded, he needed to make that as difficult as possible. He ran back to the computer console in the engine room, still open to the diagnostic menu, and anxiously paged through it to find the command he knew must be in there: a way to disable the engines and stop the ship from moving. He didn’t want the boarding party to gain control of the vessel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although he found the command, when Kircheis attempted to enter his credentials to put it into action, he found that he didn’t have the authorization. He was only a sub-lieutenant, and not even a permanent part of this ship’s crew. He bit his lip but didn’t swear. The sounds of the fight were drawing closer.</span>
</p><p><span>He switched tactics. Captain Ansbach needed to be warned that the ships were under attack. </span> <span>He didn’t have any way to send a detailed radio message, not that he had any details, but Captain Ansbach wasn’t a stupid man: if he saw any radio signal from the ship, breaking their transmission silence, he would know that something about the plan had gone horribly wrong. There were radio broadcast test programs there in the menus, and Kircheis set them all off.</span></p><p>
  <span>As much as he could, he systematically disabled every ship’s system that the computer would let him put into a maintenance mode with his authorization from the engine room console. It wasn’t as much as he hoped, but he was at least able to put some of the ship’s gun ports into a cleaning routine, which stopped them from moving. He figured that would prevent anyone from aiming the ship’s paltry defense weaponry, for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fighting had reached the outside of the engine room. Kircheis yanked his authorization card out of the computer, and jammed his helmet on his head, grateful that he was still wearing his suit from going outdoors. Immediately, the sounds of yelling and the scrape and clash of metal on metal faded, and all he could hear was his own breathing through gritted teeth, and the drum of his heart in his ears. Kircheis ran towards the door, axe in hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He would have used the rifle that he had been handed, but he saw their attackers were using axes, which meant that the odorless and highly explosive zephyr particle gas had already been released into the room. If anyone fired a gun, it would mean a painful, fiery death for everyone in a huge radius.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking at the fight, taking place in the narrow hallway outside the engine room, Kircheis realized that the crew of the transport ship was outclassed completely, and possibly outnumbered. The invaders were crashing through the paltry and futile resistance that the crew was putting up, and Kircheis could see why: on their arms, visible as they swung their heavy axes, was the insignia of the crack Rosenritter regiment, one of the fiercest ground combat groups in the rebel fleet. Leigh had underestimated the strength of the rebel fleet on the planet, and that was turning out to be a fatal mistake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The engine room was going to be breached sooner, rather than later. Kircheis could have stayed to defend it, but that would have been useless. He needed to get to the bridge, to find Captain Leigh. That was the only thought that remained in his mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the only way to the bridge was through this fracas. Kircheis steeled himself, hands gripping his axe tightly. His vision was tinted red through the eyes of the death’s head of his suit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hallway was jammed with combatants, but his fellow soldiers were fast enough to move aside when Kircheis stepped through. He swung his axe at the first of the Rosenritter, one who was distracted by already having his own axe buried in the midsection of a wailing Imperial soldier. Kircheis’s axe found contact, right at the base of the Rosenritter’s neck, the soft joint where the helmet met the suit body. Kircheis felt the metal bite through the plastic, into bone and skin, and the Rosenritter fell forward, onto his own axe, already dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis had never killed anyone before, but he didn’t have time to process it. His mind was completely blank, thinking of nothing except how to move most efficiently, to stay alive and get to the bridge and Captain Leigh. He was already using the handle of his weapon to block an incoming blow, this one heavy and fueled by rage for what he had done to this next Rosenritter’s comrade. Kircheis plowed through him, too, using the momentum of his axe to pull it from his hands and scatter it down the hallway, and then swing his own blade at the attacker’s knees, again cracking open the vulnerable joint. The Rosenritter collapsed, and Kircheis leaped over him before someone else could take his position.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis ran. He made it past the fighting in the hallway, and through parts of the ship where fighting had already taken place, as evidenced by bloody footprints on the floor, blast and axemarks on the wall, and bodies laying in the corridors. The bridge was far away, at the top of the ship, and as he ran, he felt the ship shudder and jerk, and, with a sudden snap of breaking loose from its guy wires, lift into the air. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The alarm stopped wailing, the red emergency lights ceasing to flash.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis, in a dim and empty hallway, leaned against the wall as the ship moved forward through the windy air. With the cessation of the alarm, he knew that the bridge had already been taken. He was too late.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That didn’t necessarily mean that Captain Leigh was dead. Kircheis suspected that he would have surrendered rather than encouraging the crew to fight to the death, especially if he saw the crew was outnumbered. He didn’t know if the Rosenritter would accept a surrender like that, considering their fearsome reputation, but he had no choice but to hope that Leigh was alive. Kircheis hesitated for a moment in indecision, then decided that the only thing he could do was continue forward, and hope he found Leigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took back hallways towards the bridge, looping the long way around the rear of the ship, and in this way was able to avoid all of the Rosenritter. He didn’t see any of the ship’s crew, either. There hadn’t been many to begin with, and they had either run towards the fight, or had hidden themselves. Either way, Kircheis didn’t find anyone to ally with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A little guilt nagged at him as he snuck through the hallways, heading for the bridge. Although he wasn’t officially a member of this ship’s crew, as an officer, he really should have taken charge of organizing some sort of defense instead of running off on his own. It was too late now, and he didn’t regret his choices, but if they made it out of here alive, someone would probably reprimand him for that. The silence of the hallways, now that the alarms had stopped their caterwauling, let those thoughts sneak in, even though he remained focused on finding Leigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was highly likely that the Rosenritter would land this ship near their own forces, since their goal was to prevent Ansbach’s tanks from having a place to retreat and escape to. That way, if Ansbach’s forces couldn’t seize the mine, they would die without supplies. The tanks only had enough oxygen and fuel to supply the Imperial soldiers for a few days. The only hope, as Kircheis saw it, was to rejoin Ansbach, somehow, and either capture the base, or retake this ship with Ansbach’s help and escape off-planet. The best chance of any of that happening would be if he stuck with Leigh, and made sure he survived enough to rejoin Ansbach. From there, Kircheis had faith that Leigh would orchestrate some sort of reversal of their fortunes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He heard voices as he got closer to the bridge, and he was grateful that Leigh had forced him to learn enough of the Alliance language to know what the Rosenritter soldiers were saying. Kircheis pressed himself to the wall around the corner, clutching his axe, and listened. One man had just arrived to speak to another. Kircheis missed what was said at first, but picked up the thread of the conversation quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jurgenson still struggling with the controls, hunh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure he’ll figure it out before we get to the battle.” A chuckle, probably from the man who had just arrived. “We’re moving through mud.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what a headwind’ll get ya. You know I took glider training, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This thing’s less aerodynamic than a fucking brick. Glider training my ass. Idiot, if anyone kills the engines, we drop faster than a stone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t suggesting we would need to glide anywhere. I’m just saying I know what atmospheres act like. But I suppose even with that, flying low’s gotta be better than having to go back into orbit, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah. Is the LC still in there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, trying to make that captain talk. Not sure what he’s gonna </span>
  <em>
    <span>say</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but I guess that’s for him to know and the LC to find out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great. Well, if you need a status update, I just gave you one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A complete non-update. You just were curious about the guy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want to trade places?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off, Ashbaum.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have fun standing here by yourself with your thumb in your ass, then. Holler if you need me.” The arrival laughed, and then one set of footsteps left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis steeled himself, his hands clutching his axe so tightly that he wasn’t sure he would be able to unclench them easily. Leigh must be right around the corner, being kept prisoner in the little wardroom. All Kircheis would need to do was kill the guard, then kill the Rosenritter lieutenant commander, and grab Leigh. They could hide in the ship somewhere, and maybe take advantage of the fact that the Rosenritter leader on board was dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took one final deep breath, then charged around the side of the hallway. The guard was leaning against the wall, visor of his helmet up, axe in hand. He reacted to Kircheis quickly, bringing his axe up to block Kircheis’s swing, but Kircheis had momentum on his side, and his leaping overhead swing knocked the axe out of the Rosenritter’s hand, and crashed down, directly through the top of the Rosenritter’s breastplate. It cracked open, and the Rosenritter stumbled back, ending up pinned against the wall. Kircheis yanked his weapon free, then hesitated for a split second, his disarmed enemy before him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some other man would have run from Kircheis, during his moment of doubt about killing an unarmed man, but this Rosenritter lunged at him, undeterred. Kircheis reacted on instinct, and swung his axe again, this time catching the man in the throat. He toppled to the ground at Kircheis’s feet, blood pooling around him, staining Kircheis’s suit red.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door of the wardroom sprung open. Kircheis barely had time to take stock of his enemy: the Rosenritter lieutenant commander was already charging at him. He was shorter than Kircheis by a surprising amount, and swung his axe at Kircheis’s feet, underhanded. Kircheis only barely was able to block, and he was thrown off balance for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He realized he was stronger than the Rosenritter, as the handles of their axes ground together, and Kircheis gained the upper ground, pushing forward into the room. Inside, he could see Captain Leigh, scrambling backwards to stay as far away from the fighting as possible. Kircheis ignored him and focused on the man in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Rosenritter abruptly switched postures, dropping his axe down away from Kircheis’s, and Kircheis stumbled forward as the resistance to his forward movement vanished. The Rosenritter tried to grab his midsection, but Kircheis regained his bearings and dodged out of the way. Their positions were now reversed: he was in the room, and the Rosenritter was in the hallway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis turned around to face his enemy, and managed to bring the handle of his axe down on the Rosenritter’s visor, trying to just delay his charge until he could get a better grip on his axe. This didn’t slow the Rosenritter down, despite the outer, black visor of his helmet cracking apart. Kircheis stumbled backwards, repositioning his hands on his axe, and the Rosenritter kept coming for him, lifting his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cracked black visor fell in pieces with the movement as the Rosenritter raised his axe in an overhead strike. Kircheis was frozen in place. Now visible through the clear, inner visor of the helmet was a face Kircheis never thought he would see again in person: the delicate features of Reinhard von Musel, angelically beautiful even with his teeth bared in a silent, vicious snarl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard swung at Kircheis, and Kircheis dodged, leaving him with just enough breath to yell, “Reinhard! Stop!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reinhard did not stop. He swung at Kircheis again, and Kircheis blocked the swing, holding his axe one handed, while with the other, he did the only thing he could think of to do: dig his fingers into the quick-release latch of his helmet and pull it from his head, dropping it to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t sure if it had worked, or if he had signed his own death warrant. Time stretched strangely as Reinhard pulled his axe away from Kircheis and stepped backwards, looking like he, too, had seen a ghost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Reinhard—” Kircheis said. He was breathing heavily, and his curls were flat to his scalp with sweat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Annerose,” the Rosenritter said. The ground spun beneath Kircheis’s feet, the universe tilting onto a new axis. Her voice was cold, despite the strange light in her eyes as she looked at him. This </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>Annerose, identical to her brother, but not the girl of fifteen that Kircheis had once known. “Drop your axe,” she ordered, speaking in a clear Imperial.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis did, letting it fall to the ground next to his helmet with a clatter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Annerose reached down to pick it up, not taking her eyes off of Kircheis’s face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>From the back of the room, Leigh spoke up. Kircheis had forgotten he was there. “Kircheis, er, I’m glad you came to rescue me, but this doesn’t exactly seem like—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whatever Leigh was about to say was interrupted by more Rosenritter appearing in the doorway, looking between the corpse on the ground outside the door, and Annerose holding two axes in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you alright, Lieutenant Commander?” one of the soldiers asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Annerose said, breaking her stare at Kircheis. “For the moment, anyway.” She handed Kircheis’s axe to one of the soldiers. “Search him. Make sure he doesn’t have any other weapons. And I want two guards on the door of this room. I want to take both of them prisoner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, ma’am,” the Rosenritter with Kircheis’s axe said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Annerose stepped out of the room without another word, leaving Kircheis at the mercy of the Rosenritter soldiers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He held his hands up, but they ignored his docility and slammed him down over the wardroom table to search his armor for weapons. Kircheis submitted to this, not resisting even as his head was smashed onto the fiberglass tabletop. Revenge for their fallen comrade outside the door, Kircheis assumed. Now that he no longer had an axe in his hands, an ugly feeling that resembled guilt began to pool in his stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, he’s not gonna do anything to you,” Leigh said, a note of anxiety in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up,” one of the soldiers replied. Kircheis met Leigh’s eyes, and Leigh closed his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They finished searching him for weapons, found none, and then tied Kircheis to a chair. The restraints were only zip ties that one of the soldiers was carrying, and Kircheis thought if he needed to, he would probably be able to break them, but he didn’t like his chances of trying to escape at this moment, especially as the ship was still swaying and rocking in the wind, high above the ground of Cahokia, en route to where Ansbach was. He would have to wait until they landed to make a break for it with Leigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soldiers stepped back from Kircheis once he was sufficiently tied, and stood by the door, axes in hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You alright?” Kircheis asked, looking at Leigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” Leigh said, in the Alliance language. “For the benefit of our friends, I do suggest we speak their language.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suggest you don’t speak at all,” one of the Rosenritter said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh shrugged and leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes. His calm was feigned. With his hands behind his head, he was twisting his hair so tightly that his fingertips were losing circulation. For Kircheis’s part, with adrenaline still heavy in his system, he was jittery, and resisted the urge to fidget in his chair. He stared ahead at the guards, who shifted their hands on their axes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the tense silence of the wardroom, Kircheis had a minute to think. His heart beat strangely in his chest as he thought about Annerose as the leader of these Rosenritter, and how lucky he was that he hadn’t killed her during their fight, which he may very well have if he hadn’t shattered her visor. Reinhard would have never forgiven him for that, he was sure. What was she doing here, in command? He had known that she was in the Alliance fleet; when Reinhard had captured one of Rear Admiral Reuenthal’s ships, the articles about him had briefly mentioned her. But they hadn’t said that she was a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Rosenritter</span>
  </em>
  <span>!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although he thought about her often, Kircheis’s mental image of Annerose had been frozen at the point when she had left Odin: a teenage girl who had barely escaped destruction. He had hoped that she was happy, on the other side of the galaxy, but she always was a quiet ghost in his mind when compared to Reinhard. To find her here, with a bruising force behind her presence (his arms ached from how hard their axes had crashed into each other), was too jarring for Kircheis to wrap his mind around. Ghosts were not supposed to come back to life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, here she was. He was half-tempted to ask the Rosenritter guards what she was like as a commander, but he didn’t think that would go over well. Annerose had left the room quickly enough, it seemed likely that she didn’t want anyone to know that she knew Kircheis. He could do her the favor of keeping that secret, especially if he was planning to escape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a part of him that didn’t want to escape. If he let Annerose keep him prisoner, he was almost certain to see Reinhard again. But he glanced at Leigh, leaning back in his seat with his eyes closed, and pushed that thought out of his mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship juddered and rocked, and Kircheis had to wonder if it was just wind, or if there was something else going on, especially as the blows became more violent. Leigh didn’t move, though his expression twitched in discomfort as the ship bounced his chair on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ride grew rockier and rockier, and the ship at one point banked hard. A few minutes later, several more Rosenritter soldiers appeared, whispered something that Kirchies couldn’t catch to the ones at the door, and then roughly untied Kircheis from his chair, though he didn’t let his hands free. One of them picked up his discarded helmet from the floor and clicked it back onto his head, then escorted Leigh and Kircheis out of the wardroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mind letting us know where you’re taking us?” Leigh asked as he was manhandled out the door. He didn’t get any response. Kircheis was familiar with the ship’s layout, and figured they were traversing almost the entire length and height of the ship, headed back down towards one of the rear loading bays.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His guess was confirmed when they arrived. The bay was chaotic, swarming with Rosenritters brandishing axes and running back and forth doing inscruitable tasks. Annerose was there, shouting commands over the din. When she saw Leigh and Kircheis, she turned towards them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Put this on,” she said to Leigh. On the ground at her feet, there was a dirty Imperial exosuit, one that had clearly been stripped from a corpse. It probably wouldn’t even fit Leigh, but he obeyed, hopping around to get his feet into the legs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to haul me around,” he said gamely as he got dressed. “You could just let me go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you’re valuable,” Annerose said. “Hurry up. We have about two minutes before we land.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh took her advice and hurried in getting dressed. As soon as he had the suit on, he was tied up again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her attention was split between Leigh and Kircheis and her gaggle of Rosenritters. She glanced at her watch, then at one of the men, who flashed her a hand signal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Brace for landing!” she yelled, and then dropped to the ground, hooking her feet into the cargo grooves on the floor of the bay, and clinging on as tightly as she could with one hand, the other sheltering her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis, whose hands were still tied behind his back, didn’t have that luxury. The Rosenritter holding him had let him go momentarily to take his own cover on the floor, which left Leigh and Kircheis to fend for themselves. If Kircheis’s arms had been free, he would have grabbed Leigh, but as it was, all they could do was lay on their stomachs next to each other. He couldn’t even see Leigh’s face through his helmet, the Imperial death’s head. “Hold on, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will do my best. Thank you, Kircheis.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis opened his mouth to say something further, perhaps an apology for not being able to do more, but any coherent thought he had was lost as the ship hit the ground. From the way the Rosenritter had prepared themselves, he had been sure it was going to be less of a landing than it was a crash, and he was right. The ship hit the ground with a horrifying jolt and a scream of metal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis, who had been unable to hold onto anything except with the toes of his suit, flew up into the air, maybe a meter— he couldn’t tell. The ship thrashed beneath him, the wall and floor moving towards him. He braced and hit the ground in a tumble, the hard plastic of his suit not shattering but bending inwards. He had a horrible pain in his chest, probably a broken rib, and his left shoulder, already twisted behind him, dislocated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship came to a halt on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All the lights were still on in the bay, the engine of the ship still functioning, miraculously. It had been a hard stop, and the ship was worse for wear, but they must have come in at a low enough angle and slow enough speed to survive. New alarms were ringing in the bay, but Kircheis could barely process them amidst the chaos and shouting. Rosenritters were clambering to their feet, most in better condition than Kircheis was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh!” Kircheis yelled out, throat raw from the effort. He scrambled to his own feet, the floor tilted at an odd angle, and looked around for Leigh, the only other Imperial-suited figure in the bay. Leigh was laying on the floor, and Kircheis’s heart stopped for a moment, thinking he might be dead. He stumbled towards him and crouched down. “Captain Leigh— are you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” Leigh groaned, though his voice sounded thick and bubbly, and he coughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They didn’t have time for any other checks on the other’s health— two Rosenritter soldiers grabbed Leigh and Kircheis by their tied hands and dragged them up and towards the exit of the bay. The doors had opened, letting in a wall of reddish sand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Annerose stood at the front of it, axe in hand. She stood out from the rest of the Rosenritter by her short stature, and her shattered visor, and the way the rest of the soldiers orbited around her. “Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!” she screamed, gesturing with her axe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Rosenritters streamed out of the bay, dragging Leigh and Kircheis with them. Just outside the ship, everything was invisible in the huge wall of sand that the crash landing had thrown up. Sand was piled up in a mound around the edge of the ship, and to get out of the bay, the Rosenritters slid down it. Leigh tumbled when dragged, slowing his captor down. Kircheis managed to stay on his feet as he ran, but he could barely breathe, and he tried to steer his way towards Leigh, trying to keep together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Through the thick wall of sand in the air, vague shapes began to emerge: the crumpled wreckage of Imperial tanks poked out from beneath the ship, or were half buried under the mounds of sand. Several tanks were on fire, throwing acrid black smoke up into the tangle of red dust in the air, limiting visibility further. Annerose had crashed the ship into Ansbach’s front line.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Further off, from the tanks that had not been hit, Imperial soldiers were climbing out, running pell-mell towards the Rosenritter. Some of them had guns in hand, some axes, and a horrible battle began, or continued. Kircheis and Leigh had been dropped into the thick of it. All they could do was try not to trip over the rocks and their own feet in the sandy ground as they were dragged and shoved forwards, towards some destination they didn’t know. Stray blaster fire whizzed past them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Imperial soldiers from Ansbach’s forces were heading towards the ship. Someone must have given that order, because the movement was happening all at once, in a wave. Despite the confusion of the scene, and the pain that he was in, Kircheis understood: the ship had the Imperial soldiers’ only hope of surviving. If their tank line had just been decimated, they would no longer be able to take the base. The ship might be a place they could hole up and defend until help arrived. It had an ansible they could use to call for help. All the ship’s running lights were still on, and the engine area still glowed like a second sun through the red sand. She might even still be able to fly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And if Kircheis and Leigh didn’t want to be prisoners of war, Kircheis would have to get Leigh there. His captor wasn’t paying attention to him except to pull him along. Kircheis bit down on his lip and wiggled his dislocated shoulder, shifting his arm in his half-destroyed suit. The suit’s arm, where it connected to the shoulder, was loose. The ties binding him were over the thick plastic of the arms. If he could just get the chestplate off, he could pull the thin inner suit lining of his arms forward out of the hard armor. If he just had leverage—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was trying to wiggle his arm free when Annerose came up to their group. She barely spared him and Leigh a glance: she was focused on the path forward through the line of Imperial tanks, running. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A blast of tank fire— Kircheis didn’t know which side it had even come from, at this point— struck the ground directly in front of them. The concussive blast threw him, Leigh, Annerose, and the Rosenritter holding him captive, to the ground. He was dazed for half a second, but realized this may be his only chance. The rock beneath the sandy ground was uneven, and he inched forward along it until his chestplate caught on an outcropping of rock, and popped free from his chest. He scrambled to his feet and with a cry of pain, pulled his arms out of his armor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Annerose was still on the ground next to Leigh. Kircheis looked her in the eyes for just a moment, her expression one of surprise, then grabbed Leigh with his good arm, hauling him to his feet, and then ran back into the haze of sand, towards the downed Imperial transport.</span>

  <em>
    <span>August 487 I.C., Cahokia-III</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t have time to look back at Annerose von Müsel on the ground as Kircheis dragged him away. Kircheis wasn’t any gentler than the Rosenritter had been, and Yang struggled to keep on his feet. At least his haste was due to an abundance of care, rather than a lack of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they had gotten far enough away that they couldn’t see any of the Rosenritters through the red-sand haze of the air, Kircheis slowed enough to pull Yang down into a hiding place. They took shelter momentarily behind the wreckage of an Imperial tank, one that had been hit by enough of a concussive blast to rip its top off and slide it sideways down a sand dune. Yang and Kircheis crouched in a tiny pocket its descent had formed in the terrain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis scooted behind Yang and said, “Hold still, sir, I’ll get you out of the ties.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang waited obediently, and felt Kircheis manhandle his arms for a minute, managing to cut through the tie with a piece of sharp debris from the tank they were sheltered beneath. He shook the tension out of his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Kircheis,” Yang said. “I appreciate it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis flipped the visor of his helmet up so that Yang could see his expression, the death’s-head giving way to Kircheis’s pale and worried but very much alive visage. Yang did the same, though this revealed to Kircheis still-wet blood streaked down his face, and made Kircheis look at him with wide-eyed conceren. During their landing, such as it was, he had hit his head on the floor hard enough to bloody his nose. He wasn’t sure if it was broken, but its ache was among the least of his concerns.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you alright, sir?” Kircheis asked. Now that they had stopped running, he seemed to be in more pain than Yang was. He was hugging his left arm to his chest, and he spoke with an unusual short wheeze of breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, Kircheis,” Yang said. “Are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll live, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good.” Yang peeked out from their hiding place into the swirling red air. A tank blast landed somewhere nearby, enough to shake the ground and crumble some of the sand from the edges of their little shelter. “Living is— good.” He finished his sentence rather lamely. There wasn’t much more that could be said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What should we do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On his elbows, Yang looked out into the fray. Indistinct figures ran by, heading in different directions and then vanishing into the dust. Tank fire boomed in the distance, amid yelling and gunblasts. It was pure chaos. Even if Yang had a radio from which to issue commands, he wasn’t sure if there remained an organized force to follow them. Here in this inner zone, it looked like it was every man for himself, after Ansbach’s soldiers began abandoning their tanks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ansbach,” Yang said. “We need to find him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How, sir?” Kircheis asked. He crawled next to Yang to look out from their hiding spot and winced as he moved. Yang suspected he had broken something, and he wished he had a way to help him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He closed his eyes for a moment, thinking back through the haze of years to his time at school, the days when he had faced Ansbach in the simulation games. Ansbach had never been the type to run, like Yang had. This disaster of a scenario was not one that suited his play style. It didn’t suit anyone, of course, but especially Ansbach. He had preferred very tight, deliberate movements. The way to defeat him was to knock him off balance, even if by just chipping away at one flank of his fleet, and by not giving him an opportunity to stop and reorganize, he would be unable to stop his carefully arranged attack plan from spiraling out of control. Of course, it had been years since Yang had played him last, and in that time, he was sure to have changed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the tanks in the center of the fray whose crews had abandoned their vehicles first, Yang saw. Ansbach must be trying to form a defensive line with the outer vehicles, trying to keep the bulk of the Rosenritter’s forces from being able to crush them inwards before they had taken up a defensible position at the ship. Ansbach, who hated to retreat, would be with them giving orders from his tank radio until he couldn’t anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll be at the front,” Yang said. “Or close to it. Holding the line.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.” Kircheis’s voice wasn’t very confident, but he retained faith in Yang, more than Yang really deserved. “If you stay here—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shook his head. There was no reason for them to split up. Yang had no desire to die hiding in this precarious foxhole, and he couldn’t justify sending Kircheis to Ansbach alone. The situation was too desperate for him to even make a light comment about it. He just laid his hand on Kircheis’s good shoulder. Kircheis nodded. Without a word, they scrambled out of the hole in the dune, orienting themselves towards the front of the battle by the way the abandoned tanks were facing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stumbled over bodies on the ground, Imperial soldiers. Kircheis didn’t hesitate before picking up two rifles from the corpses, handing one to Yang. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t hit the side of a barn,” Yang said, but took it and slung it over his shoulder anyway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rosenritter on foot approached through the haze. Kircheis dragged Yang behind an abandoned tank and heaved himself up on the treads so that he had an overlooking perch, He aimed and fired, downing the pair of Rosenritter without hesitation. Yang leaned his head on the tank and closed his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stumbled forwards. Some of the tanks they encountered now were still filled with crews, though this made things more dangerous, because the fire was fiercer in this area. They had to duck and weave and avoid the Rosenritter soldiers, and Yang was pathetically out of breath, barely able to keep his balance on the sand. Only the lighter gravity of the planet was keeping him from keeling over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The tanks that were still able to move in front of them had bunched up. In a coordinated movement, the hatches of the rear row of tanks popped open, and the crews began to scramble out and run backwards. Ansbach must have just issued an order for this section to retreat. Leaving the abandoned tanks in a tight line like this would make it harder for the Alliance soldiers to push their own vehicles through, buying the people taking the ship time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang flagged down one of the retreating soldiers, yelling after him, “Hey! Where’s Ansbach?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soldier pointed further down the line, then kept running. Yang and Kircheis headed in that direction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach’s command tank, unremarkable save for the white Braunschweig family crest painted on its side, appeared through the gloom. The ground was being rocked by more and more tank blasts, and it seemed like every few steps, Yang and Kircheis had to shelter behind an abandoned vehicle or fall to the ground to avoid whizzing overhead fire. At least there were fewer soldiers on foot that they needed to avoid here. No one else was stupid enough to run through this strip of land, unless they were abandoning their tanks to run to the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Further ahead, the line ceased to be much of a line: the Alliance vehicles were mired amidst the Imperial tanks. The area where Ansbach’s command post was stopped was the furthest extent of purely Imperial vehicles in a cohesive unit. After that, things frayed out. Tanks that were still able to move were trying to gain some semblance of a formation, but it was hopeless. Yang could see that from even his limited view on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He scrambled up the backside of Ansbach’s tank, clinging onto the ladder for dear life, and then banged on the porthole on the top until a soldier opened it. Yang, with his visor up, was instantly recognizable, and the soldier let him down into the cramped and dark interior. Kircheis swiftly followed. The tank was not pressurized, so they could enter quickly. Everyone was wearing their suits and helmets inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach was in the rear, his visor flipped up, speaking into a radio and looking at a flickering green display, one that only showed the positions of the tanks that remained functional. It was dire. He looked up at Yang, and an inscrutable expression crossed his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How the hell did you get here?” he asked. It was a question that carried the implication that Yang had been presumed dead in its delivery, but Yang ignored that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think I’d forget where you usually placed your command token?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach scowled. “Sit down and don’t bother me,” he said, turning back to his map. Yang leaned on the wall of the tank, which was rocked by a nearby blast. He listened as Ansbach tried to issue some orders to the tanks in front of them. Ansbach’s voice stayed even, but his whole demeanor was one that acknowledged that this venture was futile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he could say anything else into the radio, Yang said, “You need to retreat and get to the ship. This isn’t a defensible position.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think I don’t know that?” Ansbach snapped, seemingly before he could stop himself. For a man who was usually so controlled, it startled both of them. “What did you come here for? Both of us being here—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang closed his eyes, tilting his head back against the wall of the tank. “You won’t leave unless there’s someone here to take your place on the line, and you need to go. You’ll be able to arrange a defense of the ship, and you’ll survive.” Yang’s smile was grim. “You know I can’t return to Odin without you alive, Cartier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach, at Yang’s use of his first name, tensed. “You want to be a martyr so badly. Someday, someone’s going to let you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang said nothing in response to that, though Kircheis looked between him and Ansbach, clearly sensing that something deeper was passing between them, and not comprehending it. Ansbach hit the broadcast button on the radio, and said, “This is Captain Ansbach. I am transferring command of the forward line to Captain Leigh.” He cut the transmission quickly and stood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll have to go on foot,” Yang said. “There’s no way for a vehicle to get through.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach ignored him, and instead retrieved his rifle and axe, checking the energy pack of the first and attaching the second to the holds on his back. Yang sat down at his former position and took stock of what remained of the line while Ansbach prepared to leave. Ansbach had been having the crews abandon their tanks in onion-like layers, but Yang was already thinking of more effective strategies, to save as many of the outer tank crews as possible. As he began issuing orders of his own, Ansbach stood below the tank’s entrance hatch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get to the ship as quickly as possible,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang just nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach pushed open the tank’s hatch and climbed out, followed swiftly by his own assistant, and he vanished into the swirling red sand, the hatch clanging shut as he slid off the tank’s side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis fit himself in among the tank’s crew, looking out the front view to survey the ground in front of them, watching the inexorable crumbling of their line. For Yang, the world shrank to containing just the map and the radio as he calmly issued orders. He asked for the tanks that remained in line to push forward and provide covering fire for the crews that had been stranded outside the main formation, to allow them to abandon their vehicles and escape. He did his best to rescue as many of those forward tank crews as he could, though it wasn’t ever going to feel like enough. All of this happened very quickly, and the Alliance vehicles were closing in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis made his way to the back of the tank. “Sir,” he said, “We will need to move, or we’re going to be—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that moment, the radio crackled to life. “This is Captain Ansbach. I’ve established control of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hercules</span>
  </em>
  <span>, all remaining units proceed to the ship…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang tuned out the rest of his instructions, nodding at Kircheis. He gave a regretful look at the map, looking at the tanks who were still stranded out beyond help, and issued his last few commands, ending with echoing Ansbach’s order to get to the ship if possible. He didn’t wish them luck out loud, but he thought it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He followed the tank crew out, one of the soldiers laying across the top to provide some paltry covering fire as they departed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The haze in the air was less now, some of the sand beginning to clear. While this made their journey more treacherous, now that the Rosenritter could see and shoot at the fleeing Imperial soldiers from further away, it made the huge bulk of the ship easier to find, and the ground easier to traverse. Getting to the front of the line had felt like crossing impossible miles of distance, but now that they could move in a straight path, the journey was shorter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although the Rosenritter continued shelling the ground that Yang was running across, the majority didn’t pursue on foot, and their vehicles couldn’t get through the line of abandoned tanks. This meant that most of those who were able to get away from the very front of the line were likely to make it to the ship, including Yang and Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had not gotten a good look at the ship on their way out of it the first time, and so as they ran towards it, buried half in the sand, his eyes couldn’t help but follow the gouge it had left in the earth as it crashed, and the equivalent scar on its belly. Still, its engines had an ember-glow far overhead, showing that it still had power, and its whole structure hadn’t caved in. And it still towered above the soldiers, tiny in comparison, who ran to take shelter in the mouth of the beached whale.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Yang and Kircheis scrambled hand over hand up the sand dune that formed up at the base of the ship, the sand crumbling beneath them as they went, soldiers at the top were yelling at them to hurry. Yang hastened as much as he could, though he kept sliding backwards down the sand, feeling like he was moving at a crawl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a great groaning of metal from the ship, and the sand started quaking, little rivulets of grains making resonant patterns under the force of an overwhelming and bone-deep vibration. It shook Yang to his core, and he could barely stand upright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ahead, Kircheis yelled, “Captain Leigh!” and stumbled back down the dune, grabbing Yang’s arm to haul him up the sand. The tremors grew worse and worse, and the ember-glow of the ship’s engine became more like a second sun in Yang’s peripheral vision. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even as Kircheis dragged him up the slope towards the open maw of the loading bay, Yang craned his neck to look down at the soldiers still running as fast as they could across the killing field, towards the ship that was straining to leave them behind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship was shaking sand off its sides, and it struggled to rise, giving Kircheis just enough time to pull Yang onto the diamond-textured metal of the slumped open loading ramp, the soldiers manning the door keeping it extended as long as possible, to give the chance for as many of the men to make it onboard as they could. Ten, fifteen more people made it in the scramble. Anyone who fell, who slid back down the hill, was left behind. The </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hercules</span>
  </em>
  <span> gave one final groan and wobbled into the air, the ship’s gravity engine winning its battle against the planet. Grains of sand, caught in the distortion field of the ship’s engine, rose and swirled with it, a shimmering waterfall as the ship lifted from the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang watched from the top of the ramp, wind brushing through the loading bay and almost knocking him off his feet. Kircheis clung onto him to keep him upright and safe inside the ship. Soldiers still on the ground outside fell to their knees, looking up at their last hope departing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The relief Yang felt for having made it onto the ship was hollow, watching the figures below grow smaller and smaller as they rose into the air. The mechanism that closed the bay doors finally kicked into action, the gears fighting against sand trapped in their teeth and against the wind that rocked the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir, we should go to the bridge,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded, and they went.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The interior of the ship was relatively undamaged, save for the few places where stray blaster fire had singed the walls, and a few doors that the Rosenritter had cut open on their way through the ship. The hallways were crowded with people, though. Six ships had come in, and now all of their remaining passengers were crammed onto one. The losses had been steep, of course, but there were still so many survivors sitting slumped against the hallway walls, exhausted and defeated, looking hardly any different than the corpses, except for the way that they pulled their feet in to let Yang and Kircheis pass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bridge was a hive of activity, Ansbach standing in the center of it, watching a console that showed the ship’s status, half the systems lit up red. Ansbach saw Yang come in out of the corner of his eye, and he looked up at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You made it,” Ansbach said. His voice was dull and flat, and he turned away from Yang as soon as he walked over. “The duke wouldn’t like to see me return without you, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did you take off?” Yang asked, studying the console. The ship was barely fit to fly. In fact, with the gouge on the ship’s bottom, they couldn’t move laterally very well, and were directly ascending. Instead of finding a safer place to land, Ansbach was bringing them up into space. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang held his helmet loosely, and turned it over and over as he looked at the status display. Dried blood was still smeared across his face, cracked and itchy now. He was feeling the day hit him, and he couldn’t help but connect to the display of the ship’s systems, the unsteadiness and pain in his legs matching the flashing warning that their lower control surfaces had been damaged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach’s hands tightened into fists, and Yang watched his thumb fiddle with his heavy jeweled ring. “Did you think I’ve forgotten what you would do?” he asked. His voice was bitter. “That is your strategy, right? Retreat, instead of defending a fixed position?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked away, but had to answer. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll wait in orbit until someone can come relieve us,” Ansbach said after a second, his tone businesslike again. “The structure’s too damaged for us to use the corridor properly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded and said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach tapped the console. “The radio logs show we picked up a broad-spectrum ansible distress signal sent out by the mine, after the crash. The rebel fleet will be in the corridor soon enough. I sent a request to Iserlohn command for aid as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you not have anything to say about that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is there to say? If Iserlohn command picked up the rebel fleet distress call, they would have sent out a fleet to meet them. They were probably already on their way before you sent your request.” Yang looked down at the computer console. “If we have enough oxygen and food to wait for a few days, there’s nothing we can or should do, aside from hiding within the system, if we can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re taxing the engines to just get to orbit. I wouldn’t risk it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine. And the oxygen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We probably have leaks,” Ansbach said. “Given the landing. I’ve sealed off the lower decks, and we’ll monitor the situation. Once we see where the leaks are, we can send crews to patch them. We probably have enough to survive a week, maybe a little longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A brief silence fell between them. Yang rubbed the back of his head. “I’ll… go find places for everyone to stay. Triage and…” He trailed off. There wasn’t anything else they had to discuss, though Yang was sure they would later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go,” Ansbach said. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took many hours to get the ship into some semblance of order. The worst part was compiling a list of who the survivors were, and differentiating between ‘dead’ and ‘missing’ as much as possible. But that was required for an accurate headcount, and that was required to figure out how to feed and sleep this many people, on a ship designed to hold a quarter of their number. At least the bays which had once held tanks were empty, and so makeshift sleeping areas could be laid out for all the soldiers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The medical suite on the ship was overwhelmed. Though most of the people who had made it back on board were able to walk under their own power, there were plenty of injuries, some severe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rations, they at least had more than enough of, though passing them out to everyone proved to be another task that took more effort than anticipated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang, who was never good at this kind of organization to begin with, was thankful beyond words for Kircheis’s steady presence. Even though he was surely more exhausted and injured than Yang was, he was calm and collected, and did not utter a single word of complaint, though Yang would not have held it against him if he had. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed to Yang that Kircheis did not want to leave his side, even after all of the most urgent problems had been solved, and the ship was settling down into its first groaning, painful night. The vessel had been judged structurally sound enough to not disintegrate as it sat in orbit, but that didn’t mean that the odd moans that its frames made as they shifted against each other, the popping and pinging of metal settling into new configurations, was any less disconcerting when mixed with the sighs of the tired and injured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang eventually ordered Kircheis to stop following him around. “Kircheis,” Yang said. “I’m relieving you of duty. Go to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir,” Kircheis said. It wasn’t a refusal, but it wasn’t his usual quiet acquiescence, either. “You should, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang rubbed the back of his head. “At least take a shower,” Yang said. “Even if you won’t sleep, I think everything’s taken care of enough that it will hold for now. And if it doesn’t, there’s nothing you or I can do about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang watched him head off down the hallway, and then he decided to take his own advice. The ship’s plumbing on the lower decks had been shut off to fix leaks caused by the crash, but the upper decks still had running water. It therefore was the privilege of officers to take showers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He finally peeled himself out of his dirty armor and stood under the hot water. The blood from his nose had worked its way all down his chest, caking itself onto his skin. It sloughed off pink and spiraled down the drain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang leaned his head on the wall of the shower stall. His nose was tender to touch, and the dark circles blooming under his eyes were more bruises than exhaustion. All he could do was stand in the water and breathe until he calmed himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything had gone so wrong, and he felt responsible for it, as the architect for this plan in the first place. It might have been simply bad luck that had caused the plan to collapse before it even started, but that didn’t make him feel any better about the dead, or those left behind on Cahokia, sure to be prisoners of the Rosenritter by now. He tried to keep his thoughts on the present: he had survived, the Rosenritter were planning to leave this planet as soon as their distress call was answered, Braunschweig would still likely get to keep Cahokia… He had even so far succeeded in preventing a massacre of the civilian workers in the Alliance mine, for whatever little that meant, since he had succeeded in that goal by losing spectacularly. If no one arrived to evacuate the Rosenritter,that would be a different story, but— he scrubbed at his hands and tried not to feel glad that dealing with them would be someone else's duty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The heaviest thought was that he couldn’t help but wonder if this was a portent of things to come. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>All his planning had come to nothing. And this had been six ships of soldiers against one regiment, on a tiny, inhospitable, remote planet. What did that mean for his ability to orchestrate a war for the control of the entire Empire? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kept his eyes closed and tipped his face into the beating stream of water. It bounced on his painful nose. He had always known that there were no guaranteed successes. He had to keep that in mind. Hindsight was perfect, of course. He could have asked Braunschweig to send a larger force, though that would have presented its own dangers; he probably should have had their ships return to space rather than providing a ground base; and even if he hadn’t done that,  there must have been some way to stop the assault on the ships. But it was useless to think about all of that now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He felt nebulously bad about Kircheis, as well. He hadn’t anticipated how painful it would be to see his student take on the responsibilities of a soldier, especially for his sake. Yang pressed his palm into his eye, trying to free himself from the memory of Kircheis shooting the Rosenritters. The image hovered in the forefront of his mind, swirling red dust when he closed his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Today had certainly been the first time that Kircheis had killed anyone, and Yang thought of Kircheis’s reluctance to leave him and go to sleep. He remembered back to years ago, when he had briefly been given his first command under Merkatz— Merkatz had seen how rattled he was and had made sure he would be alright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If anything, Yang’s guilt for forcing Kircheis into the situation should have motivated him to take responsibility immediately, rather than pushing him away. Even if this was one more thing that Yang felt bad about, it was at least something he could still rectify. He shouldn’t let it fester.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He finished showering, dressed in a clean uniform, and retrieved the bottle of brandy he had stashed away from his footlocker. It had been securely wrapped in among his clothes, so it was undamaged despite the hard landing. He carried it and two mugs down to Kircheis’s room and he knocked on the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis pulled the door open. He, too, was damp from the shower, but he hadn’t dressed completely yet. He was wearing pants, but no shirt. Looking at him, Yang could imagine that was because it would be painful for him to raise his arms over his head: his left side from hip to shoulder was a mass of darkening bruises. He was surprised to see Yang, and seemed torn between saluting and reaching for his discarded shirt on his bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I come in?” Yang asked, holding up the bottle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis nodded, and shuffled sideways so that Yang could enter, shutting the door behind him. There wasn’t anywhere in the tiny room to sit, except for side by side on the little bed. Yang unfolded the fold-down desk, deposited the mugs on it, and silently poured drinks for the both of them. He handed one to Kircheis, who drank it before Yang could even say a word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I came to apologize,” Yang said, twisting his own mug in his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For what, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I leaned on you today harder than I had any right to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis offered him a smile, though it was tired and thin. “Don’t worry about it, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was silent for a moment, tipping his brandy back and forth in his cup. “How are you feeling, Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, sir,” Kircheis said. This, although delivered in Kircheis’s usual pleasant, even tone, was the baldest lie Yang had ever heard him tell. He was stiff as a board, sitting next to Yang on the bed. If Yang nudged him, he might whole-body topple over, from how tightly he was tensed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should have the ship’s doctor look at that,” Yang said, nodding at Kircheis’s bruises.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve had worse, sir.” He stared ahead of himself, at the photographs that Yang now noticed taped to the wall. “There’s nothing you can do for bruised ribs, and the doctor has more urgent cases.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded silently. After a second, which stretched long and awkward, Kircheis understanding that Yang had more to say, he said, “Kircheis— ah— Siegfried—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis looked over at him, eyes widening in something approaching alarm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not very good at this, am I?” Yang rubbed the back of his head. In a rush, before Kircheis could say something to reassure him, Yang said, “I want to tell you that you did well, because you did more than I had any right to expect of you. I expected it of you— asked it of you— because I know how capable you are, but I hate that I did. I— I don’t want to thank you for killing for me.” He closed his eyes for a moment, seeing the red sand, bodies crumpling to their knees. “It’s a hard thing to ask of a subordinate, and a worse thing to ask of a friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Kircheis said. He looked at Yang, and the look communicated all that Kircheis was kind enough to leave unspoken between them: he followed Yang because Yang was the kind of man who did not want to ask him to kill. Yang tried not to shy away from his gaze, though it was almost painful. Kircheis relented after a moment and turned away. He looked at the photos on the wall again, at the picture of Martin Bufholtz, and said, “It’s terrible to be a soldier, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Yang agreed. Now that he had said what he needed to, and Kircheis understood, Yang relaxed, if only a little. Enough to drink his brandy, anyway. He looked at the photographs, too. “Fraulein Hilde will be glad that we’re coming home early.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis nodded and sipped his drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The third photograph on the wall was a familiar one: the young Kircheis and the two Müsel siblings. “That woman sure is something,” Yang said, pointing at the picture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn't know that she was, before now. I wish I had known,” Kircheis said. He seemed unable to put into words what he really felt about Annerose. Yang couldn’t blame him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The universe is a small place. I’m sure you’ll see her again sometime.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope not,” Kircheis said. “I don’t like being her enemy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did she say to you, before I arrived?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, nothing much,” Yang said. “She asked me about our mission, and I asked her about some of her regiment’s recent adventures. The last I heard of them, Muller told me they had secretly escorted an important refugee off Phezzan. She wasn’t very keen on answering my questions, though.” He shrugged. “We didn’t have much time to chat. I would have liked to have spoken with her under better circumstances.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Kircheis said, a little choked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would have done things very differently if I had known the Rosenritter would be there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There was no way for you to have known.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang smiled ruefully. “No, there wasn’t. That’s the problem with life. You’re always operating off of incomplete information.” He looked at the photograph again. “Even if I couldn’t do anything differently, I would have warned you that she’s in that regiment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis shifted, his tone accusatory. “You knew she was a Rosenritter, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Muller, on Phezzan, mentioned it,” Yang said. “It hadn’t come up as relevant before now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was surprised at how annoyed Kircheis was. “I would have appreciated knowing.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang gave him a sidelong look. “In this circumstance? Yes. But I thought we agreed that—” He shook his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s better for me to not be involved and invested? Right.” Kircheis said, voice unusually dark, and finished his cup of brandy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was silent for a moment. “If you want to see my correspondence with Muller, I will show it to you. I trust you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis looked down into his empty cup. “May I say something, sir?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to ask permission.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not just about you trusting me, sir,” Kircheis said. “It’s also that—I know you have secrets, and I know that you have to keep your plans to yourself, in order for them to work—I have to trust you to tell me what I need to know, and make all the pieces work together. And I do trust you.” He looked away from Yang. “If that’s what you need from me, I can be the tool that fits the pieces together, and I don’t even have to know what the pieces are. That’s—I understand how it works, to be someone’s subordinate. But I don’t understand you, Captain Leigh. There’s a difference between a subordinate and a friend, and for all that you say, I don’t know which I can be for you. It’s not easy to be both.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Softly, Yang said, “You think I don’t keep secrets from my friends, Kircheis?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you shouldn’t, sir.” He wasn’t looking at Yang; he was looking at the photograph of Martin on the wall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was quiet for a moment. What surprised him was not that Kircheis was frustrated with him now, but that Kircheis had been so willing to trust him without the power of any of the secrets that bound him to others. What was there to him outside of that? Yang couldn’t see it. Some squirming thought in the back of his mind wondered if Magdalena would even be content to marry him if he hadn’t been the holder of her secrets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed to Yang that he was not a person, he was a cutout in the universe into which knowledge fell. Only the outline of him was visible, like a black hole revealed by starlight warping around his gravitational lens. Even those who knew him only knew him in part, and the shadows in his depths must have seemed to them all the darker for the light on the parts of him that they could see. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want to know, Kircheis?” Yang asked finally, looking down at his knees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was startled. “Sir, I don’t—” He cut himself off and fell silent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” Yang said. “Ask.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a moment for him to compose his question. “Why did you become a soldier, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The affection Yang felt for Kircheis in that moment was so strong, he developed a lump in his throat. “It’s a silly story,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s alright, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you know I was born on Heinessen,” Yang began, refilling both their glasses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang smiled. “My father was a merchant ship captain, operating between Heinessen and Phezzan. He and my mother divorced when I was very young. He never could keep a wife— she was his second— he always seemed happy enough without one, anyway. I lived with my mother on Heinessen until I was five, and then she died, and after that I lived with my father on his ship, except when we stopped on Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He described his father’s love of art, the life on the ship that was always having some mechanical difficulty or another, and his childhood friends. He told Kircheis about how the engine of his father’s ship had exploded, making it not even valuable as scrap, and how he would have been responsible for the ship’s debt as someone who benefitted from the loan, as was the law on Phezzan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But a little while before that, my friend Boris Konev, he had talked me into taking the IOA entrance exam as a joke. It was to help him get out of summer school, but I think he might have just been curious about the test, and wanted a friend to take it with him. Anyway, we took the exam together. I was accepted.” He shrugged. “So, when my father died, and I needed to escape the creditors, I had a new life that I could slip into. I’ve been here since.” He hadn’t mentioned his real name, and Kircheis didn’t ask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Kircheis said. Of all the stories in the world, he probably hadn’t expected that one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve always been good at beating a tactical retreat,” Yang said. He ran his hand through his hair. “I had to work hard to justify it to myself, because…” He looked off into space. “I am a soldier, and that’s a tool designed for killing, and put into the service of the crown.” He let out a breath. “It’s days like this when I think maybe the universe would be better off with me in some Phezzani workhouse—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir,” Kircheis said. “What about El Facil?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s smile was halfway to a grimace. “Well, I try to do what I can. No one’s ever going to tell me if the harm I do outweighs the good. But I try to be a tool with blunted edges, pointed in the right direction.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When all of this is over…” Kircheis began.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cahokia?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, when Kaiser Friedrich’s successor takes the throne.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you going to do?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang leaned back on his hands. “There are easier questions you could have asked me, Kircheis,” Yang said. He glanced at him. “Questions with definite answers. I’m afraid you’ll think less of me when I tell you that I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir, I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat in silence for a second. Yang considered filling up his cup with more brandy, but decided against it. Instead, he said, “You really should get some sleep, Kircheis,” and heaved himself to his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This time, Kircheis was more amenable to the suggestion. “Yes, sir,” he said.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Although he was exhausted, Yang’s sleep was fitful, and he ended up getting back out of bed just a few hours after he had gotten into it. Without anything better to do with himself, he headed to the bridge. The ship was quieter now, a ghost town of sorts, with many of the lights dimmed for third shift, and all the soldiers tucked away in their makeshift quarters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bridge wasn’t empty, of course. There were the usual members of the crew manning all of the consoles, but also Ansbach, sitting in the central chair. He was leaning heavily on the armrest, and Yang could tell he hadn’t slept at all. The coffee in his hand did nothing to disguise his exhaustion, though it was a natural feature on his already sallow face. He followed Yang with his eyes as he entered the bridge. Yang ignored him momentarily, and walked around to the rest of the staff, getting the ship’s status and saying a few words of encouragement or greeting to them. He ended up in the center of the room and sat on the nearest console, facing Ansbach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t stay awake forever,” he said. “I’m not sure why you’re still here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach just glared at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But if you’re going to be awake, we should talk,” Yang said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is there to talk about?” Ansbach asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang gave him a look. Ansbach reached down and activated the privacy barrier that surrounded the center chair, allowing them to speak in private. Yang felt the tingle of modulated air pass over his skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang wrapped his arms around his knees as he sat on the console. “What are you going to say to Duke Braunschweig about this?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re making a lot of assumptions, thinking that we’ll even make it back to Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think we’re out of the worst danger at this point,” Yang said. “Unless the ship is less stable than you thought it was when we took off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach took a sip of his coffee, making a face. “I was referring to the rebel fleet on its way. If the fleet from Iserlohn command doesn’t meet them in time, we will be dead, sitting here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. “There’s nothing we can do about that, so we might as well plan to arrive back at Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you want to focus on the things you believe you can control?” He scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like— ah, nevermind.” He hugged his knees more tightly. “I can’t stop you from doing anything. I just thought it would be easier for both of us to present a unified front.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think I’m interested in that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hoped so, since I’m not dead. It wouldn’t have been difficult for you to blame all of this on me if I was.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your redheaded sub-lieutenant wouldn’t have let me lay a hand on you.” Ansbach was vitriolic, but there was no real force behind his implied threat. “I’m surprised that he didn’t accuse me of splitting up because I thought that you would want your chance to kill me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked at him. “Is that the reason you had me stay at the ships?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach gave a rough half laugh but didn’t answer the question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t ever tell him you tried to kill me,” Yang said. “If that matters any. I didn’t want to poison the well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How kind of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. “Regardless, here we are. What are we going to do when we get back to Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know Muckenburger and the Kaiser better than I do,” Ansbach said. “Will they let Braunschweig have the planet even if we’re crawling back home with our tails between our legs?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Braunschweig is willing to present it as a fait accompli,” Yang said. “If he puts more ships in the system, more people on the planet, right away, then…” He trailed off. “He did have the Kaiser’s blessing before, in a way. They can’t really evict him.” Yang scratched his head. “Braunschweig is the one who will determine how much he’s willing to invest in this scheme. And you know him better than I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A fait accompli,” Ansbach repeated. “Would be easier to present it like that to him if we kept a force here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heh, I don’t think we have anywhere close to the resources to seize the base down there at this point, let alone build our own.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach looked over Yang’s shoulder, towards the large display at the front of the room. The red ball of Cahokia loomed large, sunrise just cresting along one edge. “No, we don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know why you’re asking me what to do,” Ansbach said. “It’s not like I have any power here. He sent me to make sure you didn’t fuck this up. It’s my responsibility, as much as it is anybody’s. My head’s on the line.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take responsibility,” Yang said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, fuck you, Leigh.” They were silent for a second. Ansbach finished his coffee and grimaced into his cup. “If Braunschweig can keep the planet, he won’t care about six ships,” he said. “It won’t matter to him at all. If they leave” —he nodded at the surface of the planet— “we can say we succeeded at forcing out the rebel fleet, and that he should feel free to set up his base on the planet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll buy that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have something better to say?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then this is what we’ll work with.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was, admittedly, a plan that meshed with Yang’s typical way of thinking. Putting a spin on things was easy enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It almost makes it easier that we lost,” Ansbach said. “Fleet command will understand that our little building outpost project was never meant to stand up to a regiment that we hadn’t known was there.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Yang said. “I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you ever lost before, Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not enough to kill me,” he said. “I try not to hope for more than that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t understand what game you’re playing here,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It seems to me like we’re well past the point of games, if it ever was a game with you and me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would you volunteer to take the blame?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. “Braunschweig gets rid of me— that’s about the worst that could happen. It might be better for me if he did. And if we agreed on what we were going to do beforehand, it would let me know what to expect, at least.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m supposed to believe you would be content to go back to whatever hole you crawled out of? Without having profited off His Lordship’s trust in any way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t want to be here,” he said. “You know that as well as I do. If I had been trying to orchestrate my way into Duke Braunschweig’s good graces, rather than having to sell myself into his service, it would have looked a lot different.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach made a dismissive noise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang tilted his head. “I’m not a complicated man,” he said. “I don’t have plans. When you look at me, you see all that there is to see.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I could ask you about what your plans are. But I probably wouldn’t put much stock in anything you said either, so I guess we’re even that way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach was about to say something else when there was a commotion outside of their privacy screen, one of the men sitting at the consoles standing up and motioning to them. Ansbach dropped the shield of air, letting the normal humming and beeping soundscape of the bridge back in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sirs,” the man said, “there’s an ansible transmission from one of the Iserlohn fleets. They’re requesting to speak to Captain Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me?” Yang asked, rubbing his head. He glanced at Ansbach, whose brow furrowed. “Whose fleet is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral Mittermeyer’s, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.” That explained it. He shrugged at Ansbach, who continued to glare, then hopped off the console and wandered over to the communications station.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a voice only transmission, and it was half garbled with static. “This is Captain Leigh,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Glad to hear your voice, Captain Leigh,” Mittermeyer said. Even through the hiss, Yang could hear the warmth in his greeting. “I was told you had some trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t lie and say that we haven’t. You’re calling because you’re headed this way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a momentary silence. “My orders are to intercept a rebel fleet in the corridor,” Mittermeyer said. “My fleet is in the best position to do so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang could read between the lines of that statement easily enough: rescuing Yang was not among Mittermeyer’s orders. Mittermeyer was obviously calling to see if he should disobey or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m always happy to waste bandwidth on a social call, if that’s all this is,” Yang said. “I assume you’ll pass through here on your way back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Mittermeyer said. “It shouldn’t take too long to deal with the rebels.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Yang said, “we’re not going anywhere. I look forward to seeing you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll make it fast.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t rush on my account,” Yang said. “As long as the whole rebel fleet doesn’t end up in this starsystem, I don’t anticipate any more trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good.” There was a pause. “I dropped to sub-light to talk to you,” Mittermeyer said. He had likely also dropped to sub-light speeds at the last moment before needing to course change to rescue Yang or not, but they both left that unsaid. “I’d better get moving if I want to catch the rebel fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see you in a while, then. Thanks for checking in, Rear Admiral,” Yang said. “Stay safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer laughed. “You too, Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The garbled transmission ended, leaving nothing but an empty static hiss. Ansbach, who had been listening, made a face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think I can </span>
  <em>
    <span>order</span>
  </em>
  <span> a rear admiral to divert his whole fleet for one ship?” Yang asked, raising his eyebrow at Ansbach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What would have happened if I had been the one to answer the call from your underclassman?” Ansbach asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang just shrugged.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <em>
    <span>August 487 I.C., Inside the Iserlohn Corridor</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a rough few days waiting in orbit around Cahokia to be rescued. The ship was in terrible condition, and that made everything, even sitting still, that much harder and more miserable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The worst part of the wait came when a small group of Alliance ships was picked up by their long-range sensors, headed towards Cahokia. It really was a small group, and Yang hypothesized to Ansbach that it was a rescue mission for the stranded Rosenritter on the planet. That didn’t reassure the crew any.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their ship, being as heavily damaged as it was, couldn’t move from its position in orbit. What Ansbach decided to do, the only thing that they </span>
  <em>
    <span>could</span>
  </em>
  <span> do, was shut down the entire ship before the Alliance group approached. This made the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hercules</span>
  </em>
  <span> appear completely dead, a husk in the sky around the planet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They watched with bated breath as the Alliance ships, some of them looking just as damaged as the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hercules</span>
  </em>
  <span>, sent shuttles back and forth to the planet. They were a rescue mission, and they seemed too busy to take any potshots at the dead-looking Imperial ship. They left as quickly as they had come, and Yang breathed a sigh of relief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” he said to Ansbach. “The rebels have cleared out, and we’re still here. I guess we really can report that to Braunschweig.” He looked at the grainy, magnified footage of the planet’s surface that their ship’s sensors managed to pick up. “They didn’t even self destruct their base. Probably booby-trapped it, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach turned his back to him, staring at the display of the empty planet below. “You’ll report that to the duke, then,” Ansbach said. “When Rear Admiral Mittermeyer picks you up, I will remain here with a skeleton crew and take over the rebel base. I’m sure that the rear admiral can loan me enough supplies to do so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was startled, to say the least. “Why?” It was a stupid question to ask; he knew the reasons why: it would make their hollow non-victory appear much more real if they left some nominal force on the planet, and it seemed like Ansbach had no desire to make the trip back with him and Mittermeyer. Still, it was not a pleasant task to volunteer for, when compared to the safe ride back to Odin that Mittermeyer represented.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just make sure that His Lordship sends a permanent crew as soon as possible,” Ansbach said, and that was the end of the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer’s fleet arrived three days later, and were greeted with cheers of relief from everyone on board the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hercules.</span>
  </em>
  <span> The transfer of people and supplies from ship to ship was done in an orderly and quick fashion, as was Mittermeyer’s usual style. As Yang transferred to Mittermeyer’s flagship, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Westberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Yang noticed that she, too, had a scar down her side. She must have been hit during whatever fleet battle Mittermeyer had just won against the Alliance fleet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Yang was greeted with a warm welcome, it was not until they were well en route to Iserlohn when he and Mittermeyer could finally speak privately. Yang met him in his quarters after dinner. His rooms were tasteful, if small for someone of Mittermeyer’s rank. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The </span>
  <em>
    <span>Westberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> (and Reuenthal’s sister ship, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ostberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>) were both quite old, and had not ever been intended for use as flagships. Reuenthal and Mittermeyer had chosen them of all the ships available because of their twin names, but their use of the ships was always going to be temporary; likely when each of them was promoted again, they would receive a newer flagship. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had never been onboard before, so he looked around before taking a seat. There were no pictures of people, but there was one landscape photograph in a frame, looking down onto a small town surrounded by fields from some high cliff perch. The photographer’s shadow was visible on the ground, which suggested that Mittermeyer had taken the photograph himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang pointed at it. “Barbarasturm?” he asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer was across the room, opening his small liquor cabinet to pour them both drinks. “Yeah,” he said. “I liked to hike that mountain, for the little while I was there. One of the only good things about the place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang took a seat on one of the couches. Mittermeyer came around to hand him a glass of whiskey, then sat down across from him. Yang sat with his legs tucked underneath him, but Mittermeyer leaned forward, elbows on his knees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re just itching to yell at me,” Yang said. “So you might as well get it over with.” He raised his glass. “Prosit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer frowned, opened his mouth, closed it again, and then finally drank his own whiskey before saying anything. “Your first command in years, and it ends with you losing so badly you need to evacuate the planet and run back to Odin. I thought you were too smart to need me to rescue you,” Mittermeyer said. “What the hell happened?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I underestimated the rebel fleet presence on the planet,” Yang said. It was true enough. He was tempted to tack on a sarcastic ‘sir’, in deference to Mittermeyer’s rank, but decided against it. Mittermeyer wasn’t chewing him out as a superior— they weren’t even in the same chain of command— but as a friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure,” Mittermeyer said. “I understand that can happen. But even with that— I talked to some of your staff. I’m sorry, Leigh, but nothing about your plan made any sense. It has your name on it, but it looks like it was written by a first year cadet. A cadet Staden would like for playing things straight.” He shook his head. “A formal tank battle, approaching from kilometers away? Unless you’ve changed completely over the past few years…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. “I wrote it so that anybody could follow it. I wasn’t intending to go there myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer continued to stare him down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want me to tell you?” Yang asked. He was having difficulty withstanding Mittermeyer’s gaze. There was an uncomfortable moment of silence. “Do you want me to say that I should have brought some of the Braunschweig family atomics along? Bombed a mine full of civilian workers from orbit, before they even knew they were under attack?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That answers the question, then.” Mittermeyer looked away. “You did want them to see you coming.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” He tipped his whiskey around in his glass. “I wanted them to have a chance to evacuate. I figured they might have ships hiding in system, or if they didn’t, someone would come to rescue them if we hadn’t parked a whole fleet in orbit.” He looked down at his hands. “I had Braunschweig send the most minimal force possible, on purpose. Less damage whoever was leading them could do. I could have asked for more.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer was silent for a long moment. “I know I’m not really one to talk,” he said, “but this is the kind of thing that’s going to get you killed, Wen-li.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled at Mittermeyer’s use of his real name. “I hope not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Me too.” Mittermeyer scowled. “But I have to worry that some day I’ll get the news that some scheme of yours…” He drank his whiskey, then poured himself another glass. He held out his hand for Yang’s to refill his, and Yang hastily finished his drink and passed his tumbler over. “Are you always going to make me second guess everything I see you do? To wonder if it’s because you’re throwing yourself onto the sacrificial altar—” He tugged at his ear. “Not like— I mean, I’ve been the beneficiary of that. I shouldn’t complain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re even now,” Yang said. “So, forget about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer shook his head. “I don’t think so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang wanted to say that he would have done the same for anyone, would have thrown away his freedom and become Braunschweig’s toy for anybody who asked for his help, but he realized, from the way that Mittermeyer was looking at him, that that would have been the completely wrong thing to say. It would have broken something precious. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Yang said, “It’s not a debt that I want you to repay, Wolf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was funny that they hadn’t talked about it much before now. Although they had been in the same place since on plenty of occasions, they rarely had more than a moment or two to speak privately. After all, on Odin, Mittermeyer was often with Evangeline— and since she and Yang got along well, there was no reason that she shouldn’t be there when he and Mittermeyer got together. But there was a whole half of his life that Mittermeyer did not discuss with Eva outside the barest summary, so it left little room for him and Yang to speak freely. The last time they had had a conversation by themselves had probably been the previous autumn, when Yang had asked Mittermeyer’s advice about marrying Magdalena. That had been a strange conversation, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But now they were together, and they were headed back to Iserlohn, where Reuenthal was stationed. Yang searched his memory for when the last time the three of them had been more than incidentally alone with each other, or alone with each other without some pressing reason for one of them to leave. It had probably been years. Since the three of them always met on Odin, Yang never having any reason to leave the planet, there was never a moment when Mittermeyer did not have his wife’s home to go back to. Iserlohn— it was difficult to contemplate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer’s smile at Yang was strange. It wasn’t even really a smile. There was a light caught in his eyes, and he looked at Yang with such an intensity that Yang had to turn his face away, look back in his drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did I ever thank you properly, at least?” Mittermeyer asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you did,” Yang replied. “But don’t worry about it, really.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It seems like Braunschweig is bound and determined to put you in situations that will kill you, so I don’t want you to think that I’m not grateful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s lips twisted. “If I die, it certainly won’t be </span>
  <em>
    <span>for</span>
  </em>
  <span> Braunschweig. So it doesn’t really matter that I’m in his employ.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer was silent for a second. “I never imagined you would think that kind of reasoning mattered much. Dead is dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do know me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” There was a long stretch of silence, Mittermeyer clearly struggling to find something to say that didn’t cross the line of Yang’s secrets, or any other. “Ansbach isn’t going to try to kill you, again, is he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang smiled. His expression was soft but his voice was wry. “You know, of all the people in Braunschweig’s organization, he’s the one I trust the most.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer laughed at that, lightening the mood significantly. “Nevermind, Wen-li, I don’t understand you at all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>August 487 I.C., Iserlohn Fortress</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It never ceased to be a joy to return to sub-light speeds in the area around Iserlohn, and to watch its glittering soap bubble come into focus. From far away, its perfect, dark roundness against the backdrop of stars made it almost appear like a black hole, too close for comfort. As the ships approached, more and more reflected starlight appeared in the silvery liquid metal shell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Up close, the ships’ own reflections were visible. Circling the fortress was an odd sensation: even with navigational beacons, the perfection of its exterior gave the odd illusion that the ship was not moving relative to the fortress at all. This illusion persisted until the ripples of ships ahead sinking beneath its surface cracked the mirror, and the spell broke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang found that he was only in Mittermeyer’s way as he tried to get his fleet settled back into Iserlohn for their scheduled maintenance, so, after his flagship docked, Yang exited into the fortress properly to deal with his own straggling staff. It took him and Kircheis several hours to wrestle everything together. At least Yang didn’t have to directly report anything back to Braunschweig right now; he had spent several days putting together a written report that he had forwarded back to Odin as soon as he had gotten on station. It put as positive of a spin on things as he could, and Yang thought that Ansbach was right: Braunschweig would not care about the destroyed ships, especially since Ansbach was sitting inside the abandoned Alliance base. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His duties on Iserlohn concluded before Mittermeyer was done with his post-engagement debrief with the upper Iserlohn fleet staff, and Reuenthal was on duty for the next several hours. Yang thought about getting a beer at one of the bars on the Iserlohn concourse, but decided against it, since regardless of whatever they decided to talk about, he was sure that he would spend the evening with Reuenthal and Mittermeyer getting very, very drunk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, instead, Yang diverted to the center of Iserlohn, to the massive garden complex that provided a simulacrum of outdoors, with the overhead dome showing a projected sky instead of bare metal, and a ventilated breeze, and green plants growing everywhere the eye could see. It was one of the best places in the fortress, and Yang wandered through it, waiting for the one other person he knew on Iserlohn to arrive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite the fortress being solely constructed as a weapon of war, Yang always felt strangely at home inside of it. He couldn’t ever put his finger on why. He suspected that part of it was a holdover from his childhood, having been raised on a ship, but he doubted that was all of it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In a funny way, Iserlohn was like his father’s merchant vessel: clear and utilitarian in its purpose, but inside there were surprising touches of beauty. On his father’s ship, that had been the art that his father collected, the pieces that stirred his heart enough to carry with him. The bridge had contained bronze statues guarding the doors; random hallways had been adorned with paintings hung on the walls. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Iserlohn had its touches, too. Down in the computer control rooms, Yang knew there were giant marble goddesses guarding the fortress’s nerve center. Every door and wall had the fanciful Imperial touch of whorled metal and bronze inlays onto the flat panels of aluminum and steel. And in the center were the gardens: constructed with great care and meant solely for beauty. Topiary in the shapes of leaping animals danced between cobbled pathways; statues provided landmarks for navigation; hedges and trees blocked lines of sight strategically to make it appear that the gardens were endless; ivy carpeted the outer walls; the ceiling was a constantly shifting projection, always the sky of Odin at her most majestic, nothing less. When the overhead sprinklers doused the ground with artificial rain, only the most tempestuous thunderstorm would suffice to flash overhead. At sunrise and set, the colors were so riotous and red-bright that they made the greenery appear grey. At night, the galaxy’s worth of stars above, and a false moon, were bright enough to read by. There were no tepid, cloudy days here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like the smooth outer shell of Iserlohn, its perfection could be overwhelming to the senses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, much as Yang’s father could not quite escape the idea of art as an object that one could buy and sell, the beauty of Iserlohn’s gardens existed almost exclusively to stop the soldiers inside the fortress from going completely insane. It worked, though Yang had a dubious view of the sanity it produced, considering that they all continued to live and work as soldiers within the Empire, fighting a pointless war for a crown that did nothing for its people. But since he was one of their number, and he too was strolling through the garden, Yang couldn’t say much about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He crossed a tiny footbridge over a flowing stream and leaned on the railing, watching people walk around. That was another thing about the garden— here in this common area, there was none of the usual separation between officers and enlisted men. Spacemen second class brushed shoulders with commodores on the tighter pathways, and there was a common truce, an unwritten rule, that existed in the area to simply ignore each other, rather than stopping to salute. People even ignored Yang, for the most part, which was a relief. He continued his stroll.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Captain Oberstein looked just as dour under Iserlohn’s artificial lighting as he did under the warm sun of Odin, but when Yang turned a corner and found him, he was inordinately pleased to see his sallow face anyway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Oberstein!” Yang called to get his attention, and Oberstein walked over. “Good to see you again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oberstein inclined his head. “It is sooner than I would have expected to see you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang rubbed the back of his head, very sheepishly, and they began walking through the garden side by side. “Yeah. I’m not sure how much you know about what happened.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew about Rear Admiral Mittermeyer’s orders, and his own engagement in the corridor. It is not difficult to understand the broad picture.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded. “I’m lucky to be alive, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For my part, I’m glad that you remain that way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will Duke Braunschweig dismiss you from your post?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “Despite everything, I can still tell him that we accomplished our objective.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang chuckled. “You’re the only person who thinks it’s a positive that I’m working for the duke.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I believe I said that it would be useful for you to be in positions where people recognize your talent.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmm,” Yang said. “And you think Braunschweig does?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He is not a man who would spend resources on a base forward of Iserlohn by himself. Even if he does not appreciate your talent like others might, he is at least giving you some latitude to exercise it.” Oberstein led them further into the center of the park, towards an area that was a thick copse of trees, with a bubbling water fixture nearby. There were plenty of soldiers strolling the park, but none within hearing range, especially with the rushing of water over rocks. “I’m surprised you would not prefer to capture Iserlohn from inside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang gave him a wry look. “It’s that obvious, is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Oberstein said. “But I have studied your earlier Iserlohn analysis quite thoroughly. I know your work when I see it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m flattered that you paid so close attention,” Yang said. He was uncomfortable with this conversation already, but he couldn’t escape Oberstein’s piercing gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you would prefer to take the fortress from the inside, would you not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang couldn’t help but look around again, double, triple checking that there was no one in earshot. “It would be easier. Cleaner,” Yang agreed. “But I— no. I wouldn’t prefer it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang glanced at Oberstein, a friendly smile on his face. “I know you’ve held the fleet commander hostage once,” he said. “But I don’t want to ask you, or anyone else, to do that for Braunschweig’s sake. You’re my friend, and your safety is worth more than that to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would not be for Duke Braunschweig’s sake,” Oberstein said. “It would be for the sake of the future, and your sake, since that future depends on you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked away. “You have a lot more faith in me knowing what I’m going to do than I have in myself,” Yang said. “My student— Sub-lieutenant Kircheis— he doesn’t think less of me for not having any kind of design on the throne after the civil war, but I’m sure you do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oberstein was quiet for a second. “It is a credit to you that you do not seek power for your own sake. But I think you need to remember that there are things much greater than—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Yang said. He ran his hand through his hair. “Trust me, I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was the chirping of birdsong above them. Oberstein said nothing, waiting for Yang to speak again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the only person I can really talk to about this,” Yang said. “We see things the same way, or close enough. But you— it seems like you know what to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Oberstein said. It wasn’t a boast, it was a statement of fact, as cool and clear as anything Oberstein ever said. “If I may say something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You must already understand that there will be no change here without sacrifices that are made,” Oberstein said. “If you cling to the idea that you cannot use the tools at your disposal because you fear breaking them, you will not be able to accomplish what needs to be done. If you fear leadership because you feel it is not your right to make these choices— sometimes choices of who will live and who will die— then you leave that power in the hands of people who deserve it far less, and who use it to much greater harm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded and scuffed the ground with his toe. They were approaching a place where a group of soldiers were loitering on the grass, so, before they came within hearing range, they sat down on the nearest park bench.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Too bad there’s no pigeons,” Yang commented. He craned his head and looked up at the sky. “I hear them, but I don’t see them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The birdsong is fake,” Oberstein said. “I detest this place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was startled at this rare admission of personal feelings from Oberstein. “Really? I like it here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oberstein was silent for a moment. “There are no animals here at all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just surprised that you like animals so much,” Yang said. “I spent most of my childhood on a ship, so…” He trailed off. “I guess I’m used to places like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate them. Animals have simple lives. They crawl in the dirt, they eat what they know to eat. They fight and mate, but they do not love or hate beyond that. They do not scheme and build societies— or fortresses like this— that will outlive them. When one dies, it is as if it was never there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang studied Oberstein, who had taken out one of his mechanical eyes and was inspecting it for some flaw. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you like that about them?” Yang asked. “I’ve always— well, I don’t know if enjoyed is the right word— found it comforting, at least, that we have a history that separates us from animals.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even a history written in blood?” Oberstein asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You understand, then,” Oberstein said. “If you can face it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was quiet for a moment. “Will you help me?” he asked. “Find a way through?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” He put his mechanical eye back in. “Whatever you require of me, you will have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oberstein eventually had to leave to start his next shift, and Yang spent some more time wandering alone through the Iserlohn gardens, trying to shake off the strange feeling that had settled over him. Although Oberstein hated it, Yang couldn’t bring himself to dislike the eerie unnaturalness that Iserlohn represented. The gardens calmed him, in exactly the way they were designed to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the peace of the garden didn’t stop his thoughts from turning over and over, looking towards the future and then away again, as soon as he touched it with his mental view. Despite knowing that he had to confront what he was going to do about Braunschweig after the civil war, Yang had no desire to imagine himself doing— what? Some kind of coup?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While an image of Yang standing at the head of a line of soldiers storming Neue Sanssouci might have titillated Reuenthal, it only put a shiver down Yang’s spine. And he didn’t really want to think about what Oberstein imagined such a thing would look like. Luckily, Oberstein was a man who kept his fantasies, whatever they might be, well to himself. Until it came time to make plans, Yang would not think about what Oberstein was picturing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mainly, what he rolled around in his mind was the question of what to say to Reuenthal and Mittermeyer. If one thing had become clear over the past few days, between speaking to Kircheis and Oberstein, it seemed obvious that Yang should not continue to keep them in the dark. He trusted them more than he trusted anyone else in the universe, and he suspected that either of them would be willing to go with him anywhere he turned. Now that the future was calcifying in Yang’s brain, or at least coming into a bleak focus, it was an insult to their friendship and trust to not tell them his intentions, even as vague as they were.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the thought terrified him, for reasons that he couldn’t entirely put his finger on. As the end of Reuenthal’s shift approached, and the time grew closer for the three of them to meet, a strange churning took up residence in Yang’s stomach. When he pictured their faces, a jumpy restlessness came over him, and he leapt up from whatever park bench he was sitting on and wandered a quarter mile down the park promenade until he found another one. He couldn’t stay still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That didn’t stop time from creeping forward to the appointed hour, and Yang eventually made his way to the restaurant where they were supposed to meet. He doubted they would stay there for much longer than just eating a meal, since even the dark corner of the room where Reuenthal and Mittermeyer were already sitting offered no privacy whatsoever. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They looked up at him as he came in the door. He was late again, somehow. Or they were early. It was the way things usually were, but it set him off balance already. If he had been religious, he would have thanked one of the great gods, whichever one controlled seating arrangements in the feast halls of Valhalla— he was sure there had to be one— that Reuenthal and Mittermeyer had chosen to sit at a round table, rather than a booth. He didn’t have to choose which of them to sit next to. They were all in uniform, and he as a captain sitting between the two rear admirals didn’t make him feel any more confident.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I late, or are you early?” Yang asked as he sat down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you show up to a battlefield when the enemy’s already there and ask that question?” Reuenthal asked, his tone immediately sardonic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see Mittermeyer’s been telling you all about how I need to return to remedial lessons in strategy,” Yang said. “But you don’t have to rub it in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Reuenthal deserves to get his chance to chew you out, too,” Mittermeyer said. “Since I got mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me at least get a beer so I can be sufficiently prepared for the dressing down from my number one,” Yang said. “If that’s what I’m here for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal’s smile was inscrutable. “Is that what you came for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang wasn’t sure how to respond to that. His ears heated up, and he picked up the menu and looked at it to avoid looking into Reuenthal’s mismatched eyes. “Strange first questions to ask me when we haven’t seen each other in eight months,” Yang said, trying to keep his voice light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you’ll get an Iserlohn post when Braunschweig dismisses you,” Mittermeyer said. “That would be nice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s not going to dismiss me,” Yang said. He scanned the menu. “I did learn some of the right lessons from Staden’s classes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The final report on the engagement, and the politics of who won and who lost, doesn’t always have to bear much resemblance to what happened.” This came out as a grumble. “Braunschweig will keep me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Ansbach will let you get away with that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He suggested it,” Yang said. He was rescued from any further questions by the waitress coming over to take their orders, and Yang was very glad to have a beer in his hands moments later. Service here was fast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should be jealous that you’re taking Ansbach’s advice, then,” Reuenthal said, raising his own beer to his lips. “Mittermeyer tells me that you trust him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was never clear how much Reuenthal was joking when he said things like that. Probably less than either of them would like. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to talk about Ansbach,” Yang said. “I trust him to do his job for Braunschweig, which is more than I can say for any of the duke’s relatives. And I can work with that. That’s all.” He was working too hard to justify himself, he could feel the words in his mouth like marbles. He drank his beer quickly. Too fast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked at Mittermeyer, asking with his eyes to be rescued from this. Mittermeyer’s answer to that request was only a little less cruel. “What do you want to talk about, then? If not your recent misadventure. I suppose I have already filled Reuenthal in on the important details.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned and looked around at the crowded restaurant. “Nothing that’s fit to discuss over dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Reuenthal said again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean, ‘oh’?” Yang asked. “I have no idea why that surprises you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had been operating under the impression that the great Hank von Leigh was going to keep his plans close to his chest forever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—” He stopped and collected himself. “Why would you think that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We spent plenty of time together when I was on Odin, and you never mentioned a single thing.” Reuenthal traced a finger down the side of his beer mug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eight months ago I had even less of an idea of what I was doing than I have now,” Yang said. “And that isn’t even saying much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe you,” Reuenthal said. “But I’m gratified you changed your mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t you believe me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal just smiled his weird smile. It was Mittermeyer who answered the question. “At one point, you did say that you </span>
  <em>
    <span>couldn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> tell me anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang tugged on his hair. He now wished they were sitting in a booth, like they used to at Josef’s bar at the IOA, so that he could curl up on it. This chair was too stiff and exposed. “I’ve had a lot of time to think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a dangerous thing to have,” Mittermeyer said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Yang said. “I know.” He drank his beer, finishing his mug before the food had even come. “It’s not that I didn’t trust you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer smiled. “I understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure that I do,” Reuenthal said. “You’ll have to enlighten me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Later,” Mittermeyer said, sensing that they were already deep into a dangerous territory with this conversation, especially for a public restaurant. “How about you tell us how life on Odin has been, since we’ve been away from civilization for so long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Civilization?” Yang said. “I’m sure you’ve been having a better time on Iserlohn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal smirked again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you really want to know?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Reuenthal—” Mittermeyer said, tone warning. Yang gave him a half-forced smile— he wasn’t going to die from this teasing— and Mittermeyer leaned back in his own seat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wished that he had not finished his beer. He picked up the glass anyway to give his hands something to do. “Life on Odin is fine. Boring,” he said. “I’m sure the only thing that you’d find interesting was the duel that Duke Braunschweig had all his staff attend.” He launched into a description of the event, and Mittermeyer and Reuenthal listened. Things progressed more easily from there, since they had reached an agreement that any and all fraught topics would have to wait for privacy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang made no mention of Magdalena, even though she occupied half his free time on Odin. If Yang knew one thing about Reuenthal, it was that he had no desire to listen to Yang talk about his upcoming wedding, or his fiancee. He talked instead about the Mariendorfs: the trouble that Count Mariendorf was having in his role as peacemaker between outlying colonies and the crown, and Hilde’s blossoming friendship with Lady Elizabeth. He talked about palace politics: Braunschweig family gossip, the ongoing tensions with the Littenheim clan, and how Prime Minister Lichtenlade seemed to be taking over more and more power from the ailing Kaiser. All of it skirted just shy of anything that Yang had direct input to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, being so close to Braunschweig meant that anything Yang could talk about aside from his most personal business— which he was not going to discuss— was directly tied into the Gordian knot of palace power games. And that knot was only going to be cut apart with civil war. Reuenthal and Mittermeyer paid keen attention to everything he said, not just because they were out of the loop of capital news and wanted any scraps of information, but because they wondered if Yang would say anything further about his own intentions for the war. For all Yang wanted to be an outside observer, he wouldn’t be able to pretend that he was much longer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least this less personal change in topic, and the arrival of their dinner, gave Yang a chance to, if not relax, prepare for what he was going to say about his own involvement. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The funny thing was, he didn’t think it really mattered much to Reuenthal and Mittermeyer what his plans were. They cared, of course, and would certainly have valuable input. But his motivations, his ultimate goals— they were secondary to the fact those goals and motivations were </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span>. They trusted him, not an abstract ideal. The same was true of many people in his orbit, and it never failed to make him feel deeply uncomfortable. The end of Rudolph’s legacy of tyranny and oppression, a cessation of the unending war that needlessly swallowed up life after life, self-determination and freedom for all the billions of citizens of the Empire— all of these things should have been larger than Yang Wen-li, should have been the motive force for everyone around him. But, with small exceptions, they weren’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>(Yang thought dolefully of Kircheis’s friend Martin, who couldn’t even be considered Yang’s friend. Martin had his own ideals, as dangerous to his own safety and Kircheis’s as they were, and this made Yang fonder of him than he had any right to be.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oberstein could convince him to take action by reassuring Yang that whatever he did was not for his own sake. They shared the understanding that Yang was a vessel through which history might pass. The course of events could become like water pouring through him, possibly even emptying him out of everything that wasn’t necessary to secure a better future— everything that was an obstacle on the water’s path. This was not precisely a comforting view, but it was better than the alternatives. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What was strange was that this reasoning was almost completely orthogonal to why Yang had hesitated to tell Reuenthal and Mittermeyer any of his plans before. Yang could treat his own life like it meant far less than what he could accomplish with it, but when he thought about treating Reuenthal and Mittermeyer, or Kircheis, or Hilde— or even Oberstein— like they were equivalent tools, his blood ran cold. Reuenthal and Mittermeyer were not valuable to him for whatever they could do or accomplish, even in service of the greatest goal. They were valuable to him because— well, even with the strange turning in his stomach that made it hard for him to eat his dinner in the restaurant, glancing at them across the table, it was not difficult for him to look at their faces and understand it was because he loved them. It was not the kind of thing that he would write down or say aloud, but it was undeniably true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some of his contemplation must have shown on his face when he looked at Mittermeyer. He put down his napkin and asked, “Are you alright, Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh— yes, I’m fine,” Yang said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer was unconvinced, but Yang smiled wanly at him and finished his remaining pasta.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They ended up leaving the restaurant and heading to Reuenthal’s flagship, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ostberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, which was docked in among the rest of the Iserlohn stationed fleet. Unlike Mittermeyer, who was assigned to patrol the corridor with his fleet, Reuenthal only ever left Iserlohn for running drills. He remarked that he found it tedious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ostberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> was also a small ship, and if Yang had been feeling in a less strange mood, he would have given some tidbit about how the young man who had once conned his way aboard this vessel, Reinhard von Müsel, was now working on Phezzan as an attache to the Alliance’s embassy. Reuenthal wouldn’t have appreciated that comment on the best of days, however, so Yang kept silent and merely wondered if he was seeing the same route through the ship as Reinhard had traversed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal let them into his quarters perfunctorily, and discarded his jacket before finding glasses to pour them drinks. His personal decor was less sparse than Mittermeyer’s. Two big palm plants sat on either side of the couch, sitting in plastic pots labeled for transport to the Iserlohn gardens. The landscaping crew must have given extras out to the senior officers to decorate their quarters. As Yang glanced around, he looked through the open door to Reuenthal’s bedroom and he saw the sword he had gifted him many years ago still hanging up above the bed. This made Yang smile as he sat down on the armchair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer sprawled out on the dark green couch, tossing his own jacket on the armrest and stretching his arms out along the back, following Reuenthal with his eyes as he fixed them drinks. They had continued their conversation from dinner as they walked in— something about training exercises Reuenthal had been running with the stationed fleet— but Yang wasn’t paying much attention. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The beer from dinner had made him a little loose and fuzzy, though not more than that, but he found his attention trapped on watching the way Reuenthal and Mittermeyer moved so familiarly around the space. Their voices were a low and pleasant buzz in his ears, meaning only there in the lifting and dropping of tone. He pulled his feet up onto the seat of the armchair, so that he wasn’t in the way as Reuenthal walked by to hand drinks to them, and he watched as Reuenthal sat casually down inside Mittermeyer’s wingspan. Looking at them was like being a student again, like the intervening near-decade had been a strange dream, and he was back in Reuenthal’s dorm room, a strong feeling— warm, if not light— in his breast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He realized that as he was contemplating them, they were looking back at him. This realization startled him, but he had nowhere to flee from their gazes. He raised his drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Prosit,” Reuenthal said, and drank.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Prosit.” Yang hit his teeth on his glass. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer broke the silence punctuated by the clinking of ice. “So, are you going to tell us what secrets you’ve been keeping?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how to begin,” Yang admitted. He found Reuenthal’s eyes, searched them for what Reuenthal wanted to hear, but he couldn’t interpret what he found there. Reuenthal met his gaze, but Yang was distracted by the way his left hand trailed in the fronds of the palm plant at his side, twirling his fingers around in the leaves. Mittermeyer’s hand was equally distracting on Reuenthal’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Try the beginning,” Mittermeyer said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang let out a breath, and tilted his head to the ceiling, baring his throat, closing his eyes. Their twin gazes were still on him, and he could feel the tight hum of his voice in his throat, but it was easier to speak this way. “I didn’t ever want to leave the IOA, or get drawn into court politics,” he said. “You know that. If I could have stayed out of it, I would have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s no sentence that starts like that and doesn’t end with a ‘but,’” Mittermeyer said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang ignored the interruption. “I don’t want to think about it like it’s an opportunity. It is, though.” He tugged at his hair, his posture strange and bird-like in the armchair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An opportunity for what, Wen-li?” Reuenthal asked, his voice dipped low.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang opened his eyes again, wide and honest, looking at Reuenthal. “Change, at least.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had to turn away from Reuenthal’s stare after a moment, seeking refuge in Mittermeyer’s calmer gaze, but Mittermeyer looked strange, too. There was the old, torn confusion on his face— Yang had seen it many times— his brow furrowed and lips pinched but eyes open wide and thoughtful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang addressed his next comment to that conflict in Mittermeyer’s expression. “The reason I didn’t want to say anything, before, was that I didn’t want to drag you into something you didn’t want to be involved in.” That wasn’t true, but he couldn’t put words to the truer thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you talking about treason?” Mittermeyer asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang rubbed the back of his head. “I don’t know.” He studied Mittermeyer. “The Goldenbaum dynasty is— everything’s rotten, to the core.” Yang shook his head. “If I have an opportunity to make things better, I feel like I have an obligation to take it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No matter what the cost,” Mittermeyer said. His voice was strained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. This was an admission, and a hard one to make. “There’s some prices I wouldn’t pay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Reuenthal asked. His idle fingers ripped one of the leaves off the palm plant, the action belying his own tension more than his voice or face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You,” Yang said. He made sure to look at Mittermeyer, to make sure he knew he meant both of them. “I wouldn’t do anything that would cost our friendship.” That, too, wasn’t quite it, but it was enough. He looked down into his cup.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you believe that there is something you could do to cost that?” Reuenthal asked. He turned his glass, catching the light. “I didn’t know you thought that my word was worth so little.” His tone was light— he wasn’t angry, but he wasn’t joking, either. “I always intended to keep my vow to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was like they were back in school, Reuenthal professing his loyalty to Yang, in whatever he chose to do. Reaffirming vows of nearly a decade ago.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “I know what your word is worth.” Their eyes met, and Reuenthal nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer had been listening to this exchange, struggling with it, and his eyes flicked between the two of them. “What do you need me to do?” Mittermeyer asked finally.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked at him. “Mittermeyer—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not because I need to repay a debt,” he said. “Don’t think it’s that.” Although his words rang true, he looked down into his hands rather than at Yang or Reuenthal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is your reason, then?” Reuenthal asked. He tore another frond off the palm tree. There was a collection of the plucked leaves gathering on the side table now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The tension in Mittermeyer’s body was visible, his arms held so stiffly that his muscles stood out beneath the white linen of his shirtsleeves. “I can’t make the same mistake twice,” he said. “So, whatever you need from me, I’ll do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang understood. Mittermeyer had chosen respectability over loyalty to Reuenthal before, and that had cost him dearly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wolf,” Yang said. Mittermeyer looked up at him. “I wouldn’t— even if you didn’t want to be a part— you’re still—” He didn’t have the right words. He stopped and tried again. “It’s not a condition of my friendship. I’d rather give it up than make you feel like you had to do it for my sake.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer’s smile was pained, but genuine. “You’d just do it on your own.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was true, and Yang couldn’t deny it. He looked away. “Yeah. Probably.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I’d rather do it with you,” Mittermeyer said. Now that it was all in the air, he relaxed. He always was calmer once he’d made a decision, though Yang wasn’t sure that calm ever lasted more than a few hours, until he started to regret it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Mittermeyer said, strained cheerfulness in his voice, “tell us what you’re planning to do.” He raised his glass and gestured for Yang to speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang felt like he needed a moment to breathe, so he finished his drink before he said. “I think it’s a mistake to make too many plans too far ahead. But at the very least, we know that Braunschweig and Littenheim are going to fight for the throne.” Lecture mode, though it felt funny to be delivering to his friends, was easier. Still, the next sentence took some work to phrase and admit. “If I want to be in a position to influence what happens after the civil war, Braunschweig has to win.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He began his explanation of his plan to win the war. It began with breaking down what Yang considered to be the weak points of Littenheim’s coalition, and what would need to be done to actually install Elizabeth on the throne. Then he moved into describing the resources that he had encouraged Braunschweig to gather, and explained his Iserlohn gambit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By this point, Reuenthal had refilled his glass several times, so he was feeling much looser, and his posture and narrative style reflected it. Without paper, since he didn’t want to risk writing anything down here, Yang was forced to resort to ever more elaborate hand gestures in his explanations, rather than his preference of pointing at scribbled diagrams. Reuenthal and Mittermeyer were well used to his style, though, and followed along. They interjected, asked questions and made suggestions, any time they had one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they spoke, Mittermeyer leaned further onto Reuenthal, brushing his hand slowly up and down his back. Reuenthal was idly tying knots in the collection of fronds that he had stripped from his palm tree, fashioning the leaves into a braided rope on his knee. It seemed to be serving the purpose of moderating his drinking, as he would reach for his glass on the side table, and then change course and pick up a leaf instead. Though it didn’t make him less drunk than Yang, it at least only made them equally impaired.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s why Braunschweig took me on in the first place,” Yang said. “I promised to capture Iserlohn for him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Mittermeyer said. “I should be flattered to be worth as much as a fortress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should be flattered, but you’re not?” Reuenthal asked. “I think your worth is quite clear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer shook his head, but he was smiling. “I’m just surprised that Braunschweig thinks it’s possible to capture this place. Do you think you can capture Iserlohn?” Mittermeyer asked. He looked around to encompass the fortress, despite the fact that they were on the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ostberlin.</span>
  </em>
  <span> His tone was dubious. “You always ignored it in our games.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Yang said. “It would be easier from the inside, but I think— there’s no such thing as an unsinkable ship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would be easier from the inside,” Reuenthal intoned. “How fortunate that I am posted here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shook his head. “No guarantees you’ll stay here by the time the Kaiser dies. Better to plan ahead.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He finished his drink and looked sadly down into the empty cup. Reuenthal reached for the bottle and leaned heavily across the coffee table to pour him some more without even asking. Reuenthal steadied Yang’s hand with his own when Yang held out the glass, which made Yang’s stomach flip with something other than alcohol.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was going to have a terrible headache in the morning, but for now he felt pretty good. He probably wasn’t doing the best job at explaining the finer points of his strategy, but the relief of simply talking about it with them was enough that it didn’t matter. Plans were sure to change between then and now, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyway, that’s why I was on Cahokia… Learned about that place from my spy on Phezzan.” He yawned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have a spy on Phezzan?” Mittermeyer asked. “You have been busy.” He laughed. “I guess I shouldn’t have thought that you needed my help for anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do,” Yang said, drunk and very earnest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer smiled, pleased. During Yang’s explanations, he had scooted even closer to Reuenthal on the couch. Their sides were pressed together, and his hand had moved from Reuenthal’s back to his side, drifting in lazy arcs up and down between his ribs and his hips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s your spy?” Reuenthal asked. “How’d you find him? What makes you trust him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s a former student of mine…” By the time that Yang had finished his, admittedly rather garbled, explanation of his correspondence with Muller, he had finished his drink. Although he didn’t think he couldn’t deliver any more technical information close to coherently, Reuenthal was still looking at him, asking for more. “I don’t think there’s anything more to tell,” Yang said. “That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You haven’t told us what you want to happen at all,” Reuenthal pointed out. “This has been a lecture from Braunschweig’s most loyal supporter, completely dedicated to helping him put his daughter on the throne.” He tossed his head. “I could have gotten as much from Ansbach.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned. “No, I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal smiled. It was a predatory smile, like he had cornered Yang. “Then tell me, Wen-li. Who do you want to put on the throne?” His voice was low and rich. He, too, had finished his last drink, and was still fiddling with the palm fronds. He had ripped off so many of them that the nearest branch of the palm was nearly stripped bare. When one of his leaves brushed Mittermeyer’s fingers crawling across his side, Mittermeyer would strain his fingertips towards it, but Reuenthal would pull it out of the way a moment later. His fiddling didn’t require him to look down at what he was doing, so he stared at Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Elizabeth can have the throne,” Yang said. He couldn’t look away from Reuenthal’s hands, fixated on the motion of him weaving the strands into and out of each other. It gave him somewhere to look other than his eyes, anyway, which were boring into him. “She— she’s smart enough that she won’t be a puppet of her father forever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Is that a good thing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Braunschweig has fought so hard for power, he’d never willingly give any of it up.” Yang closed his eyes. “I think— Elizabeth could open a parliament. Especially if the nobles who backed her father during the war demand it of the crown. A house of lords could lead somewhere else…” He trailed off into mumbles, and cracked his eyes back open when he was met with only silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a funny dream,” Reuenthal said. “But it won’t come true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It won’t?” Yang asked. “I think there’s a chance—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You say Braunschweig would never give up his power. I agree. But Elizabeth won’t either, nor would any other Goldenbaum.” The name was delivered with a surprising amount of venom. “People who did nothing to earn what they have always cling to it the hardest. She would have everything to lose and nothing to gain.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There would be something to gain,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would be—” He got the sensation that no argument about ethics would satisfy Reuenthal, and Yang couldn’t blame him. The Goldenbaum dynasty had never once cared about morality in its rule, and the only standard Reuenthal had to judge Elizabeth by was the precedent her forefathers had set. “It would be the only way for her to save the dynasty,” Yang said. “It can’t continue on as it has. Someone will decide the throne can’t remain as it is. If she’s assassinated before she has an heir…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And who will that someone be?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. Someone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if she refuses to listen to your humble words of advice?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Yang said again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal was cruel, picking at him when he was this drunk. But perhaps that was the point: sober, Yang might have been able to steer the conversation away from this dangerous ground. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It seems to me,” Reuenthal said, “that there will come a point when you cannot stand idly by and allow the Goldenbaum dynasty to run its course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“El Facil,” Mittermeyer said. He had been quiet, leaning on Reuenthal’s side, but he had been listening. He looked at Yang and sighed. “You’d throw all your influence away the first time she did something you couldn’t watch happen. Throw yourself on the sacrificial altar.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reuenthal and Yang said at the same time, though with very different tones. Yang was protesting something that he knew was true. Reuenthal was almost cajoling, playing off Mittermeyer’s words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—” Yang said, then looked at Reuenthal, to let him finish his thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reuenthal said again. He looked down at his hands, at the palm fronds he had been weaving. He had fastened the ends together, making a circle. He pulled himself out of Mittermeyer’s arm and stood, bearing his circle of palm. He walked behind Yang on the armchair and put his hands on Yang’s shoulders, keeping him still. “You’re a man with the wrong kind of ambition for that, Wen-li.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was frozen, like a deer in the lights of an oncoming train. Reuenthal’s hands brushed his hair back from his face and put the crown of leaves on his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you think, Wolf?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer’s expression was impossibly strange. Looking at him alone on the couch, Yang wondered if this was what </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> had looked like, watching him and Reuenthal close together during the evening. Reuenthal’s hands were still in Yang’s hair. Mittermeyer opened his mouth to say something, but no sound came out except for a strangled, “I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This broke the spell that Reuenthal’s touch had on Yang, and he took pity on Mittermeyer. He shook his head, dislodging Reuenthal’s hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to pee,” he said, and stood. As he turned towards the bathroom, he very pointedly put his hand on Reuenthal’s back and pushed him gently back to the couch and Mittermeyer. “Sit."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal chuckled. “As you wish,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That didn’t make Yang feel any less confused, but he stumbled off toward the head, which happened to be through Reuenthal’s bedroom. His eyes fell again on the sword above the bed as he passed it, and he flinched away and hurried, shutting the door behind him too hard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stared at himself in the mirror, gripping the sides of the porcelain sink to keep himself from falling over. The crown of palm fronds was still on his head, his cheeks were flushed, and his forehead was shiny with sweat. Yang touched the crown with his fingertips, accidentally setting it askew; he was always clumsy where Reuenthal was graceful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang couldn’t keep a single thought moving coherently through his head. It was only partly the alcohol. Everything else— everything Reuenthal did and said— was more overwhelming. The only conclusion that he could come to was that it was probably time for him to leave for the night, before someone did something that they would regret, which seemed more and more likely to happen, if Yang let Reuenthal keep talking about ambition, or anything else. That subject was dangerous, but this drunk and with the mood in the room this strange, there were no safe subjects left whatsoever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He splashed cold water on his face and tried to breathe deeply, steeling himself to leave. He felt melancholy about it, but that was a familiar feeling, one that he could understand. And that was better than whatever the crown on his head made him feel, or Mittermeyer’s flushed face, or Reuenthal’s hands on his temples.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took him a long minute to stabilize himself physically before he left the bathroom. In the bedroom, he took the circlet of leaves off and dropped it on the bed beneath the sword, looking at it in the dim light for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Yang left the bedroom, he saw immediately that his assessment that it was time for him to leave was correct: while he had been in the bathroom, Mittermeyer had divested Reuenthal of his shirt completely, and they were engaged in a passionate kiss on the couch, limbs tangled together such that it was hard to tell where one of them began and the other ended.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang watched them for a second, standing in the doorway, feeling warm and bittersweet in the particular way that drunkenness facilitated. After a moment in which neither seemed to notice his presence, he shuffled back towards the door of Reuenthal’s suites to go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are you going?’ Reuenthal asked before Yang had even made it ten steps to the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang turned back towards him. He had hoisted himself up on his elbows, and Mittermeyer was sitting back, looking at Yang as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should go—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reuenthal said. “Stay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was frozen. There was a bubbling elation in his chest, one that clarified what he had been feeling all evening. The strangeness of the talk had only been a distraction, a cover. But that was how it had always been, hadn’t it? And now, something he hadn’t even dared to hope for, that he had forbidden himself from thinking about, was being handed to him, without any effort whatsoever. Reuenthal had torn back the veil. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t feel real. He looked at Mittermeyer, trying to make sure he wasn’t mistaken, or dreaming, or misinterpreting because he was too drunk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer had never been good at keeping his feelings from his face. His mouth was open in surprise, and his cheeks were already flushed, eyes wide. There was just a moment of the old hesitation, but when Mittermeyer’s eyes met Yang’s, it was like a switch flipped, and the crease in his brow melted away— the same thing clarifying for him, maybe. Wordlessly, he smiled and held out his hand towards Yang.</span>

  <p>August 487 I.C., Iserlohn Fortress</p><p>All of Duke Braunschweig’s staff on Iserlohn had a few days of waiting before they were to be picked up and shipped back to Odin. Without any assigned duties, this left Kircheis with a lot of time on his hands. Since he had never been on Iserlohn before, he decided to make the most of his time there and do some sightseeing in the fortress. Of course, not being part of the fortress’s staff meant that most of the operational areas were firmly off limits, but he could still visit the main concourse, and the gardens. He went to the gardens first, thinking that a pleasant stroll through them would do him good, but despite the medical attention he had received aboard Rear Admiral Mittermeyer’s flagship, his ribs were still tender in a way that made breathing difficult. He made one long circuit of the space, though, considering how winding the paths were, this barely encompassed seeing any of it, and was too fatigued for it to be pleasurable to continue. </p><p>Iserlohn had a library, and this was where Kircheis went in search of a quiet place to spend his time. He wondered if Captain Leigh would show up there, since it seemed like his type of milieu, but there was no sign of him whatsoever. Not like Kircheis needed him for anything, but wandering through the bustling fortress without knowing anyone there was a particularly lonely feeling, and Kircheis wouldn’t have minded Captain Leigh’s quiet company in the least, even if they were just sitting across from each other and reading.</p><p>The library conformed to the most austere of the Imperial design philosophies: a cavernously high ceiling, wide tables of dark wood with individual reading lamps placed down their length, ornate molding of the walls, and columns that disguised the utilitarian metal structure of Iserlohn beneath. Although it seemed that in such a space that sounds would travel, especially given how oppressively quiet the place felt, the designers had included some trick in the ventilation to suppress noise. The library itself seemed to breathe, and this constant low rush of air swallowed the sound of Kircheis’s footsteps and any hushed voices.</p><p>He didn’t sit down at the long reading tables, but instead found a corner in the back with smaller seating areas, well out of the way of most of the foot traffic. It would have been a perfect little spot if there had been a window to look out of, but instead it was simply dark and quiet. The library had a huge section of books on strategy, and Kircheis pulled one from the shelf that Captain Leigh had offhandedly mentioned once. He intended to read it, and he had the book open on his table in front of him, but his eyes kept glazing over and circling the same lines in the introductory chapter over and over. His thoughts were troubled but indistinct, flitting between subjects too quickly for him to focus in on one thing and come to any resolution about it.</p><p>After a half hour, during which he had made it about ten pages into his book, a shadow fell between him and the nearest light source. Kircheis looked up, and saw an unfamiliar man standing in front of him. He was wearing a captain’s uniform, and he had a dour face, hair streaked prematurely grey.</p><p>“Sub-lieutenant Kircheis?” the captain asked.</p><p>Kircheis stood and saluted. “Yes, sir,” Kircheis said. “Do you need me for something, sir?”</p><p>“At ease. May I sit?”</p><p>“Of course, sir,” Kircheis said. He was already confused and on guard, but couldn’t say no.</p><p>The captain took the seat across from Kircheis, and waited for Kircheis to sit down before he said anything else. </p><p>“You have an excellent commander, Sub-lieutenant,” the captain said. His voice was flat and nasally, and despite the fact that he had his back to the light, his eyes glittered in an unnatural way.</p><p>If this compliment to Captain Leigh was intended to put Kircheis at ease, it did not work. “Yes, sir,” Kircheis said, and nothing more than that.</p><p>“It seems that he did not mention me to you. I am Captain Paul von Oberstein. Captain Leigh is… a friend of mine.”</p><p>The name was familiar. “You’re the one who saved the Iserlohn fleet,” Kircheis said.</p><p>“Captain Leigh is the one who saved the Iserlohn fleet,” Oberstein said. “I was only the one who put his advice into action.”</p><p>“He wouldn’t describe it like that,” Kircheis said.</p><p>“No,” Oberstein agreed. “But that does not stop it from being true.”</p><p>“Did Captain Leigh send you here to talk to me?” Kircheis asked.</p><p>“No. He speaks highly of you, so it seemed prudent for me to make your acquaintance while I had the opportunity.”</p><p>Kircheis was grateful for the dim light in the library for hiding any flush that rose to his ears. Still, he kept his voice even. “I’m pleased to meet anyone Captain Leigh considers a friend.”</p><p>“Indeed, Sub-lieutenant.” Oberstein studied him for an uncomfortable second. “As am I.”</p><p>There was an awkward moment of silence as Kircheis struggled to find something to say. “Are you permanently stationed on Iserlohn, sir?”</p><p>“For now, yes. I imagine that might change in the future.”</p><p>“Why is that, sir?”</p><p>Oberstein gave him a look. “Fleet Admiral Muckenburger has been known to have a personal hand in some staff assignments, when it suits him. It may be that an officer with volatility on his record will not be well suited to a post on Iserlohn in the coming years.”</p><p>Kircheis could read between the lines of that statement well enough: Oberstein knew about Leigh’s plans for Iserlohn. It at least proved that Leigh did trust Oberstein, but Kircheis wasn’t sure that made him any more comfortable with the man. It would have been different if Captain Leigh was here, but he wasn’t.</p><p>“I see.” He opened his mouth, then decided not to ask the question on the tip of his tongue.</p><p>“No one can hear us here, Sub-lieutenant,” Oberstein said. “Say what you like.”</p><p>This reassurance was not reassuring in the least, but their conversation probably would be nearly incomprehensible to anyone who didn’t already know what they were talking about, so Kircheis acquiesced. “Would the fleet admiral be right to reassign you?”</p><p>“Yes,” Oberstein said. In a peculiar movement, Oberstein reached up to his face, then dug his fingers into his right eye. Kircheis flinched, then watched in fascinated horror as Oberstein’s eyeball came out into his pinched fingers. It was clear now that it was mechanical, and Oberstein was not in any distress, but that didn’t make the empty, dark hole in his face any less disturbing to look at. Oberstein pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the mechanical eyeball dispassionately.</p><p>“Did that happen when you—” Kircheis asked, unable to stifle his curiosity. He was sure that Oberstein was doing this to invite a question, but it still felt uncomfortable to comment on.</p><p>“No,” Oberstein said. “I was born blind.” He examined the eye in his hand, and the iris flashed momentarily red. “I apologize. This unit is beginning to fail.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Kircheis said. “Do you need help?”</p><p>“No.” Oberstein’s fingers were unusually narrow and delicate, and they deftly moved around the eyeball, surely touching and checking things that were too small for Kircheis to see in the muted library light. After a moment, he replaced the eyeball in his face. Kircheis relaxed some of the tension that he had been holding in his back, though now when Oberstein looked at him, he had the sense that the captain could see directly through him. This feeling was not reduced any by what Oberstein said next. “Unlike Captain Leigh, I am fortunate to be able to hide the qualities that many in the Empire would despise me for, most of the time.”</p><p>There was no way that Oberstein knew about Martin. Captain Leigh didn’t even know about Martin, not really, and he certainly wouldn’t have said anything even if he did. Yet Kircheis somehow felt that Oberstein had seen directly to his center, coldly. Kircheis kept that thrum of fear out of his voice. “Yes, sir,” he said.</p><p>“But it can be to Captain Leigh’s benefit as a leader. It encourages… a kind of loyalty.” Oberstein broke his piercing gaze. “And he is a man who can put that loyalty to good use, if he is given the opportunity.”</p><p>Kircheis remained silent. He didn’t think there was anything to say to Oberstein that wasn’t incriminating, on some level. And the frankness with which he spoke, although Kircheis understood it, alarmed him. </p><p>“You understand, Sub-lieutenant,” Oberstein said. “Captain Leigh considers you a friend, and not simply someone who works under him by obligation. I am sure that this means you have no small measure of personal loyalty towards him.”</p><p>Oberstein was waiting for him to respond. Slowly, Kircheis nodded. “As you said, he is an excellent commander.”</p><p>Oberstein didn’t smile, and there was no change in the flat stare of his eyes, but the slight motion of his head indicated that Kircheis had said something that he wanted to hear. “He is an excellent commander, if he is in a position to command. He has far more enemies than he has friends.”</p><p>“What are you saying, sir?”</p><p>“I think you understand well, Sub-lieutenant.” Oberstein steepled his thin fingers on the table before him. “If you are loyal to him, you have a responsibility that goes beyond the chain of command.”</p><p>“Like you and the Iserlohn fleet, sir?” Kircheis asked. He knew he was on dangerous ground.</p><p>“Moreso,” Oberstein said. “If Captain Leigh dies, there will not be another man this generation who is capable of accomplishing what needs to be done. He is the only one with the talent, in the right position, who understands the true nature of the Empire.”</p><p>“You’re asking me to protect him with my life, sir?” Did Oberstein think he wasn’t already doing that? Captain Leigh must have given him the wrong impression.</p><p>Oberstein stared at Kircheis in silence for a long moment. “With more than that, should it become necessary.”</p><p>“More than my life?”</p><p>“There are things greater than that,” Oberstein said. “He would not ask them of you, so I must. Anything that it takes for him to succeed, you must do.”</p><p>Kircheis tried to keep his face expressionless. “It seems like you’re asking me to disobey his orders, if I think it’s for the greater good.”</p><p>“Yes,” Oberstein said.</p><p>“And obey yours, sir?”</p><p>Oberstein stared at him. “No,” Oberstein said. “I am not the type of man who would inspire that loyalty in anyone, and I do not expect it of you.”</p><p>“Then what are you asking of me?”</p><p>“I understand that you value Captain Leigh’s friendship highly. If there should be a time when you need to disobey his orders, to sacrifice your friendship, to save his life, I expect that you will.”</p><p>“And what kind of time would require that?”</p><p>Oberstein’s gaze was piercing. “You know about El Facil.”</p><p>Kircheis tried to keep his expression neutral. “Yes.”</p><p>“He must not be allowed to sacrifice himself, no matter what the cost is— to you, or to anyone else. His value is far too great.”</p><p>“I see,” Kircheis said. “He wouldn’t see it that way.”</p><p>“I know. But you must, for his sake.” He paused. “If you would take a bullet for him, or swallow poison meant for him, taking other burdens up for him is also your duty.”</p><p>“What would you have done, if you were at El Facil?” Kircheis asked.</p><p>“At the time, I did not realize his value,” Oberstein said.</p><p>“If something like El Facil were to happen again tomorrow.”</p><p>“If I must, I would do the same thing I did at Iserlohn,” Oberstein said. “In some ways, the greatest danger to Leigh is himself.”</p><p>“Captain Leigh would not stand down from a gun pointed at his head, if there were people at stake like there were at El Facil.”</p><p>“Then I would find some other way, Sub-lieutenant.”</p><p>“Does Captain Leigh understand this about you?”</p><p>“Yes. And he understands that I can be of use to him.”</p><p>“Does he understand that you are going to tell his friends to make him abandon his morals?”</p><p>“I’m not asking him to abandon anything,” Oberstein said. “If the time comes, I do not know if he has the strength to do so. I hope that he understands what will be required of him, but I am not a man to put my trust in hope, and so I am preparing for other eventualities.”</p><p>“Do you expect me to tell you I’ll do something one way or the other, sir?”</p><p>Oberstein stood. “No, Sub-lieutenant. But you will think about it, which is all I need from you today.” He nodded at Kircheis. “Goodday.”</p><p>Kircheis watched him go, without saying another word.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Kircheis didn’t see much of Captain Leigh during their short stay on Iserlohn. He caught one or two glimpses of him in bars or strolling the main concourse, often walking next to Rear Admirals Reuenthal or Mittermeyer, or Captain Oberstein, who stood out now that Kircheis knew who he was. It didn’t seem like Leigh was avoiding him, and if Kircheis had sent him a message asking to meet, he certainly would have— when they passed each other on the concourse, Leigh gave a funny smile and wave— but Kircheis decided not to disturb him.</p><p>They ended up on a transport ship provided by Braunschweig to return them to Odin a few days later, and on that long journey he did see plenty of Leigh. He seemed to be filled with a strange new emotion, and he would alternate between smiling off into space and scowling at whatever plan he was trying to concoct in front of him. The two expressions lived on his face without much in between, aside from his usual good-natured smile when he saw Kircheis.</p><p>“Is everything alright, Captain Leigh?” Kircheis asked as he sat across from Leigh in the officers’ mess, watching him type something on his computer, with two fingers dancing over the keyboard, while his other hand waved a bagel distractedly through the air. His eyebrows were furrowed, and it looked like he had forgotten that he had a bite of the bagel in his mouth.</p><p>“Mmph?” Leigh asked, and then came to his senses more fully. “Oh, yes, Kircheis, everything is fine. For now, I suppose.”</p><p>“Is this thinking about what you’re going to do with Captain Ansbach on Cahokia?”</p><p>“Oh, er, no,” Leigh said. “I just have to get Braunschweig to fortify that position. He’ll probably have Ansbach come home, honestly. It’s a waste to keep him out there.”</p><p>“You think so?”</p><p>“Ansbach is a valuable member of the duke’s staff,” Leigh said. “We might have our differences, but I’d prefer to have him on Odin— or wherever the duke is. He’s a tempering influence, in a way that I am not capable of being.”</p><p>“I see.” Kircheis was tempted to glance at Leigh’s computer screen, but resisted the impulse. “What are you working on, then?”</p><p>“Captain Oberstein had some suggestions for me about some of our future strategies.” Leigh glanced around pointedly at the other soldiers in the mess, most of whom were involved in their own meals and discussions and ignoring Leigh and Kircheis, but Kircheis got the message.</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“He told me he spoke to you, by the way.”</p><p>“He did. In the library.”</p><p>“What did you think of him? He’s a good friend of mine, but I think— through no fault of his own— he sometimes comes off badly.”</p><p>“You trust him?”</p><p>Leigh stared off into space, a melancholy expression on his face. “Yes, I do. I don’t think that I will always agree with him, but we have the same goals, and he’s an honest and good man— and my friend.”</p><p>“I’m glad to have spoken with him, then,” Kircheis said. It was a diplomatic answer, delivered in a diplomatic tone, but it made Leigh smile.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>September 487 I.C., Odin</p><p>Kircheis was very glad to return to Odin. He arrived in the middle of the day, and so when he arrived at his apartment that he shared with Martin, it was dark and empty, Martin being at school still. It was good to have a period by himself, to acclimate to the atmosphere of his home, before Martin filled the space and all of Kircheis's thoughts. </p><p>The late of the Odin summer was still hanging on, and the warm sun was coming in through the open windows. There was the chittering of birds in the eaves of the roof, and the hustle of traffic on the street below. Water dripped from the kitchen sink faucet, and the refrigerator hummed tunelessly. Kircheis’s chair at the kitchen table creaked as he leaned back in it, and the glass of ice water he poured for himself tasted just as mineral as ever. It all grounded him, reminded him of where he was— safe at home, shedding the skin he wore when he was out for his job.</p><p>It was difficult to let go of the tension that he carried, the outer shell, but he tried to relax before Martin returned. It didn’t take long at all for Martin to get back. He had known Kircheis was coming, so he probably had left school as soon as he could, and ran back home. It warmed Kircheis’s heart to hear the door banging open, and Martin seeing his shoes lined up in the entrance and yelling out, “Sieg! You’re back?”</p><p>“I am,” Kircheis responded, standing to hover in the kitchen doorway to watch Martin pull off his own shoes.</p><p>There was a moment when they just looked at each other, both remembering the argument that they had parted on, and then Martin smiled, and all must have been forgiven, because he took the few steps forward and fell into Kircheis’s arms to kiss him.</p><p>Kircheis’s bruises were all healed now, of course, but the tenderness of the touch still shocked him, and he wasn’t sure what to do with his limbs. He had to let Martin guide him through it: letting Martin run his hands through his hair, letting Martin cup his cheeks with his delicate hands, letting Martin tug him through the apartment until they fell onto the couch, which creaked beneath their sudden, falling weight. If Martin noticed that Kircheis was making him take the lead, he didn’t care. His enthusiasm floated Kircheis along, and was enough for both of them.</p><p>Only when Martin stilled enough to rest against Kircheis’s chest was he able to move of his own volition, brushing his hand down Martin’s back and very gently tucking his hair behind his ear. Martin was smiling, the unrushed, languid, familiar expression. Kircheis’s face was much more serious, looking into Martin’s eyes.</p><p>“How have you been?” Kircheis asked.</p><p>“Fine,” Martin said. “I’ve missed you.”</p><p>“I missed you, too. I’m glad to be back early.”</p><p>“I wish you wouldn’t have had to leave at all.”</p><p>Kircheis was silent for a moment, fingertips brushing Martin’s hair. “Yeah,” he said. “I wish I didn’t either.”</p><p>Martin smiled, like he had won a victory, and he rolled over so that he could wedge himself in between Kircheis and the back of the couch, half reclining on Kircheis’s chest. Despite the heat in the room, the sweat making both their clothes cling to them oppressively, Martin’s bodyweight was comforting against him.</p><p>“What makes you change your mind on that?” Martin asked.</p><p>“I never really wanted to go.”</p><p>“You volunteered.”</p><p>“For Captain Leigh’s sake,” Kircheis said. “I’m glad I was there for him, but…”</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>Kircheis was silent, letting Martin nestle into his shoulder.</p><p>“But it wasn’t what you expected?” Martin asked.</p><p>It certainly hadn’t been, but not for any reasons that he was willing to express to Martin. There was no need to bring up Annerose. “It went pretty badly,” Kircheis said. “I’m lucky to be alive.”</p><p>“Oh. So much for Captain Leigh’s plans.”</p><p>“No, it wasn’t really his fault,” Kircheis said.</p><p>“If you say so.”</p><p>“He did his best to make sure as many people made it out safely as he could. That’s the kind of man he is.”</p><p>“He’s the kind of man who works for Duke Braunschweig,” Martin pointed out.</p><p>“So am I.”</p><p>This brought Martin up short, but he came up with a response quickly enough. “I think you’re different. And you were forced into it.”</p><p>“So was Leigh.”</p><p>Martin shrugged. Although the conversation was already treading in dangerous waters, Martin was still relaxed, which made Kircheis feel like he had room to clear the air.</p><p>“I killed people out there,” Kircheis said after a minute. His voice was low, barely even audible. Martin stiffened against him, but didn’t immediately leap up. Kircheis didn’t know what he would have done if Martin had. Maybe the reason Martin didn’t react was because he didn’t know what either of them would do either. “I did it because I was protecting Captain Leigh, and because I might have died if I didn’t. But I still made the choice. There’s only so much you can say I was forced into.”</p><p>“Most people who make excuses don’t understand that,” Martin said. “Why are you telling me this, Sieg?”</p><p>“Because if I didn’t, you would wonder, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“And that’s worse?”</p><p>“I don’t want to lie to you.”</p><p>“It would be easier for you if you did,” Martin said.</p><p>“I don’t know why you think so.”</p><p>Martin let out a heavy breath, and, after a second, said, “Was it difficult— to kill, I mean?”</p><p>“No,” Kircheis said. He closed his eyes. “It wasn’t.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Why do you ask?”</p><p>“I’m in my last year of school,” Martin said. “No more deferment after that.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“How do you justify all this to yourself?” Martin asked. “I know you. You couldn’t possibly enjoy it. But you do it anyway. I know I won’t. No matter what anyone tries to make me do— I won’t go out there and kill for the Empire.”</p><p>“You’re a better man than I am.”</p><p>“Nobody else would say that.” The flattery— though it hadn’t been intended as such— soothed Martin, made his tone warm. “We don’t live in a time or place where people valorize anything other than death.”</p><p>“I wish we did live in a different time,” Kircheis said. “Maybe someday.”</p><p>Martin’s voice took on the tone it always did when he was quoting something, though Kircheis didn’t recognize it. “Someone, I tell you, will remember us. Even in another time.”</p><p>The silence filled the room as Kircheis waited for Martin to finish the poem, or whatever it was he had been quoting, but Martin didn’t say anything else.</p><p>“Can I ask what you’re planning to do, when you are called up?” Kircheis asked.</p><p>“It’s dangerous to ask.”</p><p>Kircheis fell silent.</p><p>“I won’t go to the killing fields. I’d rather do anything else.”</p><p>“Anything?”</p><p>Martin shrugged. “I can’t stand by and watch it happen. To me, or anybody else.”</p><p>“Will you run away?”</p><p>Martin shrugged again, but this time he looked up to the ceiling, and there was a contemplative tone in his voice. “I don’t know. Maybe.”</p><p>“What’s the alternative?”</p><p>“There are plenty of alternatives.” The weird, thoughtful tone in Martin’s voice put Kircheis on edge.</p><p>“You won’t do anything dangerous, will you?”</p><p>“I’m not afraid of dying,” Martin said. “I just don’t want to be made to kill.”</p><p>“Martin—”</p><p>“Maybe we shouldn’t talk about it.” He paused. “I won’t ask you for anything, Sieg.”</p><p>That was painful, and Kircheis couldn’t even tell if it was designed to cut, or if it was meant to be an olive branch.</p><p>“I would help you run,” Kircheis said. “Or hide. Whatever you needed.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Martin said. “It’s still a year away. Don’t worry about it, Sieg. I’ll figure something out. And I don’t want you to get in trouble.”</p><p>Kircheis tried to push the fear away. “I feel like you’ve changed the way you’re thinking about this since I left.”</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Martin said. “My morals have always been the same.”</p><p>“But you don’t want to ask me for anything, now.”</p><p>“I believed you, when you said you didn’t want to give it.”</p><p>Kircheis wanted to protest, to say that he had been referring to something completely different, but to Martin, they must have been one and the same. Martin was good at making him feel ashamed, even if it wasn’t his explicit intention. It was the guilt of knowing that Martin was right, and that Kircheis was going to continue down his own path, far away from the clear and cold light that Martin saw so clearly.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Returning to work in Duke Braunschweig’s staff offices felt odd. Although Kircheis had been through the most harrowing ordeal of his life thus far, the world of Odin and Braunscwheig’s normal fleet routines had continued on without him. His desk and cubicle was just as he had left it, and his fellow junior officers and the rest of the staff of the building greeted him warmly upon his return, asking jovially how it had been on Cahokia. Kircheis responded to this with as much friendly candor as he could, but the mask was firmly back on, and he couldn’t say much to any of his coworkers, aside from Leigh, who was not around. Since Ansbach had remained on Cahokia, this meant that Leigh had the unenviable responsibility of going over the current status and future plans with Duke Braunschweig himself, in his manor.</p><p>Kircheis wasn’t sure when Leigh would be back, and, although Leigh had left him with a handful of clear tasks to accomplish, Kircheis kept leaning backwards in his seat and glancing out the window, hoping to see Leigh return, walking up the street with his hands in his pockets and his face up towards the sky, as was his usual way.</p><p>There was no sign of Leigh, but on one of the times that Kircheis glanced backwards out the window, he saw a familiar car pulled up outside— it was Count Mariendorf’s personal vehicle, recognizable by its slightly antique make and its unusual forest green color. Kircheis had no idea why Count Mariendorf would be stopping by Duke Braunschweig’s admiralty except to speak to Leigh, but Leigh wasn’t around. He slipped out of his cubicle and jogged through the building to find the count, checking upstairs at Leigh’s office first, where Count Mariendorf was just beginning to knock on the door.</p><p>“Count Mariendorf!” Kircheis said. “I’m sorry— Captain Leigh isn’t here right now.”</p><p>The count turned and smiled at Kircheis. “Oh, Sub-lieutenant Kircheis. It’s good to see you again. Leigh told me in a letter that you had an unpleasant time on your trip. I’m happy you’re back safely.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir,” Kircheis said. “Was there something you needed from Captain Leigh?”</p><p>“I was hoping to ask his advice, but if he’s not here I might have to do without it.”</p><p>“I’m happy to pass along a message for you, if you like.”</p><p>“I’m afraid that will be a little too late. I’m leaving tonight.”</p><p>“Where are you going, sir? If I may ask?”</p><p>“Is there somewhere private we can speak?”</p><p>“Of course, sir.” Kircheis pulled out his ring of keys and unlocked Leigh’s office, which made the count raise a silent eyebrow. “I sometimes come in here to drop things off while the captain is out,” Kircheis said. “He won’t mind if we talk in here.”</p><p>“Captain Leigh trusts you quite a lot.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. I try to live up to his expectations.”</p><p>Leigh’s office was just as messy as ever, though he had made some effort to tidy it before they went to Cahokia. Kircheis pulled out the two chairs in front of Leigh’s desk so that they could sit facing each other, neither wanting to offer the count the messy spot that Leigh usually occupied, nor take it himself. Mariendorf looked around, and his eyes settled on the picture that Leigh kept on his wall, the one of himself and Rear Admirals Mittermeyer and Reuenthal, when they had all been cadets.</p><p>“Did you see Rear Admiral Reuenthal while you were on Iserlohn, by the way?”</p><p>“I saw him, but didn’t speak to him. Captain Leigh did, though. He seemed to be doing well.”</p><p>“That’s good, that’s good.” The count settled himself into his seat, rubbing his hands across his knees. “I’m going to pay a visit to Lord Maximilian von Castrop,” he said finally. “The situation has become so untenable that the crown has asked me to make a personal intervention before the fleet is sent in to resolve the issue.”</p><p>“I didn’t realize it was so bad, sir.”</p><p>“Very few people do, Sub-lieuenant. And that’s by design. It’s not good to let the rest of the court know just how far Lord Castrop has been able to push things while we continue handling him with the kid gloves.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. I can see that. What was it that you wanted to ask Captain Leigh?”</p><p>“I have a distinct feeling that Lord Castrop is going to force the crown to take off its gloves sooner or later. I doubt that I will be of any effect going there.” He sighed. “I wanted to ask Leigh’s opinion, about how much I should warn Lord Castrop about what’s coming. If the situation is not going to be resolved with words, then the Fleet will need to enforce order.”</p><p>“Do you know which fleet is going to be sent, if the worst happens?”</p><p>“That’s part of what I was hoping to ask Captain Leigh. He has a very good sense of where everyone is and who goes where. But I know it wouldn’t be one of the ones stationed at Iserlohn,” the count said. “Castrop’s lands are in the other direction. I assume that the first forces sent will be some small peacekeeping fleet. Nothing huge. Fleet Admiral Muckenburger wouldn’t want to be seen to overreact of his own volition— he will send the smallest force he can until the crown orders him otherwise. After all, he doesn’t want to look like someone eager to step on the toes of all the other noble families.”</p><p>“Yes, that sounds reasonable, sir.”</p><p>“The other thing I want to know is— Lord Castrop has a set of satellites protecting his planet. It’s called the Artemis Necklace. He believes that it makes his planet safe from invasion, even if he doesn’t have a fleet of his own.”</p><p>“Where did he get that?”</p><p>“He used part of his father’s fortune to buy it from Phezzan, as well as a cut of his profits on some of his business.”</p><p>“Phezzan doesn’t have one, does it?”</p><p>“No, but the rebel territory’s capital planet, Heinessen, does.”</p><p>“Interesting,” Kircheis said.</p><p>“In what way?”</p><p>“I can probably tell you what Captain Leigh would say.”</p><p>“He’s that predictable, is he?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Well, in lieu of Captain Leigh’s advice, I’ll be happy to take yours.”</p><p>“He’d say that there isn’t a technological solution that’s infallible, no matter what the person who built it thinks.”</p><p>“He would say that.”</p><p>“And I’m sure that he would also say that Phezzan has some reason for selling this technology to Lord Castrop and the rebel territories, while not using it themselves.”</p><p>Count Mariendorf laughed. “Yes, that is the kind of thing that Leigh would say. Phezzan must not have been kind to him, to make him question their motives so often. But I think Phezzan simply does not want to antagonize either us or the rebel territories by making themselves look like a fortress rather than the only peaceful place in the galaxy.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t know, sir.”</p><p>“Yes, of course. That’s just speculation on my part, anyway. So, Leigh would tell me to warn Castrop that the Imperial Fleet is more than a match for his Phezzani technology.”</p><p>“You would have to say that anyway, wouldn’t you, sir?” </p><p>“Well, I would at least like to lend some honesty to my words.”</p><p>“Do you think he’ll believe you?”</p><p>Count Mariendorf sighed. “No, I doubt it. If he felt that the Fleet posed a real threat, he wouldn’t have gotten to this point.”</p><p>“So you’re being sent on a fool’s errand?”</p><p>“Someone has to,” the count said. “Much like Leigh, I would prefer to have a peaceful solution before sending the Fleet in. Especially if any of Lord Castrop’s confidence is well founded. I don’t want to see our soldiers die, but especially not in a petty internal squabble about taxes and inheritances.” Even as he said it, the count made a chagrined expression: there would undoubtedly be a great loss of life in the forthcoming civil war, which everyone could see on the horizon and no one could do anything to stop.</p><p>“I hope not, sir. How long do you expect to spend with Lord Castrop?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I doubt that I’ll be on his planet more than a week. If he isn’t interested in me speaking to him, then there’s no reason for me to stay for any longer. I certainly don’t want to be anywhere in the area when the Fleet comes through.”</p><p>Kircheis hesitated. “Will you be safe there?”</p><p>“I’m an emissary of the crown,” Mariendorf said. “And I myself am not a threat to Lord Castrop in any way. I don’t foresee there being any personal trouble. Did Hilde speak with you?”</p><p>“No, I sent her a letter while on the way back, but we haven’t spoken yet. Why?”</p><p>“Oh, she’s concerned about me traveling. I had wondered if those fears had rubbed off on you.”</p><p>“I thought she was concerned about the Kaiser’s health.”</p><p>“I think His Majesty will hold out for the few weeks I’m dealing with Lord Castrop,” the count said. “It certainly would be inconvenient if he died now. But then, of course, Lord Castrop would suddenly become the least of everyone’s problems.” He laughed, but it was resigned.</p><p>“I hope so, sir.” He hesitated, then asked, “Is the reason you’re asking Captain Leigh for advice because Duke Braunschweig would like Lord Castrop’s favor?”</p><p>This, too, made Count Mariendorf laugh. “While the duke would like the favor of everyone in the universe, he understands that if the Kaiser cannot even keep Lord Castrop on his side, then he has even less to offer. No, I doubt I can do anything for Duke Braunschweig in this matter, aside from handling it as delicately as I can. I came to ask Leigh’s advice as a friend.”</p><p>Kircheis nodded.</p><p>“I’m happy to have yours instead, of course.” Count Mariendorf stood. “Will you tell Leigh I came by?”</p><p>“Of course, sir.”</p><p>“And while I’m traveling, if you would be so kind as to look in on Hilde. I’m sure she would appreciate the company.”</p><p>Kircheis flushed, the tips of his ears going as red as his hair. “Yes, sir.”</p><p> </p>

  <p>
  <span>Although her father had traveled for work many times in the past, either on the business of the crown or to visit the Mariendorf family holdings, Hilde found the silence of her house different this time. Perhaps it was just because she was older, and so all the time spent outside of her manor at school or visiting friends made the emptiness of home feel more real. She didn’t know what the precise cause was, but, in the first week of her father’s trip, she spent as much time away from home as she could, only really coming back to eat dinner and sleep. It wasn’t even like something had gone wrong— her father was still en route, and he sent her a mundane letter daily. But Hilde couldn’t shake the feeling that something was going to go terribly wrong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t explain why she had such a foreboding about her father going to visit Lord Castrop. When she tried to rationalize the feeling, she decided that it was probably just projection. There was some part of her mind that was latching onto this small matter as a portent to divine the future of the Empire as a whole. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It made no sense to do that, of course. Whatever happened, the civil war that was looming on the horizon, which everyone could see and no one could stop, would look a lot different than the squabble of one tiny planet and one tiny family with the crown. But it was the first major internal strife within the Empire in her lifetime. At least, it was the first that had escalated into the threat of the Imperial Fleet being sent out against a noble family, rather than a small people’s rebellion put down on a border planet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This felt different. It felt like there was something in the air. The flexing of the power of the nobility was a sign that things were changing, faster and faster.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After all, the elder Lord Castrop, in his time, had been a loyal servant of the crown— holding the post of Minister of the Treasury, even. If he had used that post to enrich himself, that was no different than any other man who had held the post before or after. That wasn’t close to treason. The fact that his son was willing to rebel so openly felt representative of the shifting sands of the era.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She spoke with Martin about this one day, after her classes at ONU let out. They were sitting outside on a low wall by the main gate. Hilde was waiting for her driver to pick her up, and Martin waited with her, as was his habit on days when they got out of class at the same time. It was a warm afternoon, the summer not having completely retreated, though the first few crisp red leaves were beginning to tumble from the trees and crunch along the pathways underfoot. Martin was twirling one of these leaves in between two fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Castrop is right that the times are changing,” Martin said. “But he’s too early. If he had tried this after the Kaiser dies, he might have actually succeeded in ‘liberating’ his little fiefdom.” The leaf spun back and forth between his thumb and index finger. “At least for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“While everyone else is busy fighting for the crown, you mean,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. It’s a time that everybody who wants things to change should take advantage of.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde glanced around, making sure there was no one in earshot. “I hope you’re not thinking about anything dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin just smiled. “I feel like your friend Captain Leigh might try to take advantage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Hilde asked, her voice suddenly sharp. “Did Sieg tell you something?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Martin said. “But he has no reason to like the status quo, and he’s put himself in a position to change things. That’s all I’m saying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You scare me sometimes, Martin,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry.” But he didn’t sound sorry at all. Worrying about Martin brought her back around to worrying about her father, and she let out a sigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s the matter?” Martin asked. He twiddled his leaf under her chin, which tickled. It was silly, but it did cheer her up at least enough to answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Outside of all your thoughts about things Lord Castrop should have done better if he wanted to make a stand, do you think my father is in danger?” She leaned back with her hands splayed for support on the low brick wall, looking up at the puffy clouds darting across the blue sky above.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does he think he’s in danger?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he did, he wouldn’t tell me. He wouldn’t want me to worry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin hummed under his breath. “Is Lord Castrop prone to anger?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Hilde said. “I’ve never met him. I don’t have a good impression of him, from all of this, obviously, but at least a long rebellion from the crown isn’t something that’s done on a whim. It seems unlikely that my father coming to speak with him will make him angry enough to— I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, that’s something, at least.” Martin didn’t sound confident.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But the other thing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you were Lord Castrop, do you think you could get anything out of holding a count hostage?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. He seems very confident in his planet’s protective system— the Artemis Necklace— so it doesn’t seem like it would even be necessary for him to ward off any attacks by threatening my father or keeping him prisoner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does Lord Castrop own a ship?” Martin asked after a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A ship?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A ship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you ask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he has a way to get off the planet, it might be a backup plan.” He looked off into the distance. Down the road, Hilde’s ride was waiting in traffic at the closest stoplight, and would be pulling up to the curb in a moment or so. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if he’s thought any of this through,” Martin said. “But this is probably his only chance to ensure his own safety if he does have to flee his planet. If the Artemis Necklace doesn’t work. Or maybe he hasn’t thought of using your father as a human shield, and he just, I don’t know— a stupid man would want to make sure that he had someone from the Empire to </span>
  <em>
    <span>show</span>
  </em>
  <span> his military dominance to, when the Fleet inevitably comes through. If he’s confident enough that he will wipe them out, he probably wants a pet witness. To see his face.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think this is likely?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The car was pulling up in front of them. “I have a bit of a low opinion of the noble class, I’m afraid,” Martin said. “I think it’s more likely than your father being able to accomplish anything he was sent for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you’re wrong,” Hilde said. She stood, and picked up her bag from the ground. Martin stood as well, and tossed away his leaf. It fluttered away on the breeze, and landed in the road, where a car promptly ran it over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For the record,” Martin said. “I hope so, too. Of all the nobles in this world, I do like your father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde gave him a thin smile. “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll ask Sieg to keep an ear out for you,” Martin said. “See if there’s any chatter coming through Duke Braunschweig’s office, or anything like that. He should be allowed to talk about that kind of thing with me, I’d assume.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde nodded. Kircheis would have told her anything he heard, of course, but she did appreciate Martin’s attempt at being helpful. “Thanks,” she said, with as much of a smile as she could muster.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take long for Hilde’s premonitions about things going wrong to bear fruit. After her father arrived on Lord Castrop’s planet, and after the departure of the merchant vessel he had flown in on, all communication from her father suddenly ceased. Since her father was in the habit of writing her daily, this struck an immediate alarm in Hilde’s head, and she called up the colonial affairs office several times, trying to get an update about her father’s status. The staff working in the office had the same line: there had been no news from Count Mariendorf, but this didn’t mean that anything was awry. It could just mean that he was busy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde suspected that they were lying, and she wondered how long they would keep up the pretense for. She could understand wanting to keep it under wraps, whatever had happened to her father, because it would cause a stir among the nobles. She was sure that the whole thing was going to be kept quiet until the Fleet could deal with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that almost made it worse. She wondered if there had been a message from Lord Castrop— was her father alive and being held hostage, or was he dead? She didn’t want to assume the worst, but she couldn’t help but feel a sucking dread. The balance of terror— the idea that he was already dead— the hope that there was still something that someone could do— this made her barely able to eat, hardly able to sleep, for several days. Each day that passed without a word from her father sent her deeper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had called Kircheis as soon as she felt the first inkling that something had really, truly gone wrong, and he had promised that he would look into it, and had said that Captain Leigh would, as well. Although Kircheis probably didn’t have very many useful contacts, she was sure that Leigh did, and thinking of his friendship with her father settled her nerves, at least a little. If there was anything that Leigh could do for her father, he certainly would do it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, when Kircheis arrived at her house unexpectedly during dinner, when Hilde had been poking her salmon and asparagus around on her plate, alone in the dining room, she felt sure that the news must be terrible, though perhaps not the worst. If the news had been her father’s death, she was certain that Captain Leigh would have come himself. Of all the things that Hilde remembered from the summer that her mother had died, it was Leigh’s steady presence that remained in her mind most clearly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her butler let Kircheis into the dining room immediately, though he politely declined the offer of dinner, and sat down across from her. Hilde pushed her plate away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father is still alive,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Hilde replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did you know?” he asked. “Captain Leigh just told me, and I came straight here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde just shook her head. “How did Hank find this out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “His former CO, Rear Admiral Bronner, knows more than he should about everything,” Kircheis said. “Though in this case, I think he came by the information legitimately. His department was ordered to give Fleet Admiral Muckenburger a dossier on the best fleet to send to deal with Lord Castrop— delicately. The Kaiser would like the fleet to make sure your father stays alive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know why he told Hank?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “It might just be because they’re friends, or maybe Captain Leigh traded him the information— I don’t know. But this is otherwise being kept very tightly under wraps, until Muckenburger sends out the fleet. He wants this to be over before anyone knows that it’s started.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde was silent for a moment. “If he sends a fleet against Lord Castrop…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think there’s any way to know what Castrop will do,” Kircheis said. “He’s already so far outside of everyone’s expectations.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So I’m just supposed to hope that Lord Castrop is kinder and saner than all of his behavior would lead me to think, and that the fleet manages to broach the Artemis Necklace? I don’t want to say that Castrop is right that his planet can withstand the whole strength of the Imperial Fleet, but the rebel territories use the same technology to protect their capital. They wouldn’t do that if they also didn’t think that it was a powerful tool.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh pointed out to me that the rebel fleet also keeps thousands of ships within that starzone,” Kircheis said. “I agree with him that no technology is invincible. And Lord Castrop doesn’t have a fleet to speak of.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t really make the situation any better. If the Artemis Necklace is destroyed— Martin thinks that Lord Castrop would keep my father as a hostage to run away, but what if he doesn’t do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Kircheis said. He sounded strained. “I wish there was something I could do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There has to be something I can do,” Hilde said. “I can’t just sit here. I feel so useless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It might be a while before the fleet admiral sends anyone out,” Kircheis said. “You have some time— I don’t know, maybe you could write a letter to Lord Castrop and—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That wouldn’t do anything,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis agreed. He looked down at his hands. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s not your fault,” Hilde said. “I’m sorry for snapping at you.” She bit her lip. Suddenly, an idea came to her. “My father is Duke Braunschweig’s ally,” she pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes?” Kircheis said, unclear as to where Hilde was going with this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think that he has an obligation to help my father, in this circumstance?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Kircheis said. “Politics aren’t really my strongest suit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t sure if he did, especially since the whole matter was supposed to be kept under wraps. If Duke Braunschweig refused to help her father— and she didn’t even know how he would be able to help— no one would ever find out. It wouldn’t cost him anything aside from the Mariendorf family’s loyalty, and maybe a few other people that Hilde would warn against going to Braunschweig’s side. But, if nothing else, Braunschweig was a man who lived in the court, and always had. He probably had some sense of honor about alliances. And— Hilde thought— even if she couldn’t speak to the duke directly, she might be able to convince his daughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sieg—” she began.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Kircheis asked, echoing the anxiety in her tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could you ask Hank— does he think that there’s anything that he could do, if I asked Duke Braunschweig to help my father, if I go to Lord Castrop to negotiate for his release, even if that doesn’t work— do you think that Hank could help rescue him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was silent for a long time, seriously considering her words. She was so grateful to him, for not just dismissing her with a platitude, or telling her that it was too dangerous. “I will ask him,” Kircheis said. “I don’t know what he would be able to do, but I will ask.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded. “I’ll ask for Duke Braunschweig’s help, then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilde didn’t have a good strategy for meeting with Duke Braunschweig. She knew that the duke would have no desire to speak with her directly. Even being her father’s heir didn’t mean enough to counter the fact that she was a woman without her own proper title, and as young as his daughter. If she had asked him to meet, she suspected that she would be given a run-around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could ask to meet with Princess Amarie, and she would likely be given an audience, at least, but from everything that Hilde had learned about the princess, it seemed that she would be harder to convince to take up her father’s cause than the duke. Amarie was a calculating woman, and might decide the Mariendorf family alliance was not worth encouraging her husband to involve himself in yet another scheme that went contrary to the crown’s official stance— which was to keep the entire Castrop affair as a matter between the crown and one rebellious noble, </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>to involve one of the largest political alliances in the Empire. Duke Braunschweig getting involved would escalate the matter into something that could have real portents for the civil war. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Duke Braunschweig was more hot headed than his wife, and so he would not look that far out when considering if he should give his aid. He would likely only look at the immediate expenses and rewards. He might even, if he were feeling bold, try to demand some sort of reward from the crown for any helpful efforts that he chose to provide in rescuing Count Mariendorf, and putting down Castrop’s rebellion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Hilde couldn’t get an audience with the duke herself, so she would have to take a different track.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That left his daughter, who might be able to convince the duke. Hilde didn’t know if the young Elizabeth had that kind of advisory relationship with her father, but it didn’t hurt to try. Especially since she was social with Lady Elizabeth, which meant that it was not too unusual when she followed Captain Leigh to the Braunschweig manor, and asked to see her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was an unexpected visit, to be sure, but not one that would cause anyone alarm. Captain Leigh had other business with the duke, so he left to go speak with him, which left Hilde waiting in the large, dim library for Lady Elizabeth to find a second to see her. It was a rainy September day, and the wind lashed the drops of rain down against the windows in thick sheets, blurring out the view of the outside world. It was warm in the library, but the drumming of the rain was loud. It was a fitting accompaniment to Hilde’s mood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lady Elizabeth made her appearance quite quickly, striding into the library with a precision that Hilde admired. If she had been wearing a dress as complex as the auburn and gold outfit that Elizabeth was wearing, Hilde would have tripped over her own legs. Or that was the sensation that looking at Elizabeth gave her, anyway. She was so perfectly poised— even though it seemed unlikely that she was planning to leave the house today, her hair was done in an elaborate coiffe, and her face was delicately pale with makeup, her lips a dark and crisp red.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Hildegard— to see you standing there in silhouette against the window,” Elizabeth called as she came in, “I almost thought that you were Hans. He has a jacket just like yours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry to disappoint, Lady Elizabeth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hardly,” she said. “It’s a pleasant surprise to have company, especially yours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope I didn’t pull you away from anything important.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I was painting. But that’s nothing that can’t be picked up and put down again. And I tire of solitary activities.” She draped herself across one of the couches, and gestured for Hilde to sit across from her, which she did. “You came in with Captain Leigh, I assume? I passed him heading to my father’s office.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Hilde said. “I apologize for using him as an excuse to invade your home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what we pay Captain Leigh for, isn’t it? Planning invasions?” Elizabeth laughed, but it wasn’t clear if she actually found her own joke funny. “Are you and he here on the same business?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You see right through me, Lady Elizabeth. I am here for business, but my own, rather than Captain Leigh’s.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde, if this were a social call, you would have asked ahead of time. But you wanted to corner me unexpectedly. I knew you must be after something. And I’m sure a woman like you is not after my social graces.” Hilde felt disarmed by this comment, and had no idea what Elizabeth meant by it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s unfortunately nothing as simple as that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you have my attention.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you remember when we met?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wasn’t it this past January?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At your New Year’s party, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what about that occasion are you asking me to recall?” She smiled, as if they hadn’t had almost the same conversation about Hilde dressing like a man then, too. Elizabeth had a sharp memory, and clearly did remember.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you that it wasn’t my right to give my father’s answer about being Duke Braunschweig’s ally, at the time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, I do remember that. A true enough thing to say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping that something like that would be less true for you than it is for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want me to speak for my father?” Elizabeth raised her eyebrows. “Or play some kind of trick on him? You are as bold as I imagined you to be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a trick, Lady Elizabeth,” Hilde said. “You’re just the only one I can ask for help.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You always do intrigue me, Hilde. What is it that you want? Ask.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father has been taken hostage by Lord Castrop, on his planet. If I don’t do something to free him, I think that he will die. Either when Lord Castrop decides that he is no longer entertaining, or when the Imperial Fleet arrives to put a stop to his rebellion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This statement, delivered in Hilde’s most earnest tone, made Elizabeth briefly speechless. “Things have gone that far?” she asked. “I read about his contentions with the crown in the papers a while ago, but I assumed nothing had come of it, since this is the first I’m hearing of it since.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, my lady,” Hilde said. “In order to not worry everyone, this has all been kept very quiet. The colonial affairs office won’t even acknowledge that my father is a prisoner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If they won’t acknowledge that, then how did you come to learn this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father would send me a letter every day,” Hilde said. “They stopped when he arrived at Castrop’s estate. And Captain Leigh was able to gather information about a possible fleet dispatch against Lord Castrop.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth squinted at Hilde for a second, looking for something in her expression. “He learned this from his Phezzani spy?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde tried not to react too openly to this question. Elizabeth had assumed that Leigh gave her more information than she really had— no one had mentioned any more to her about the matter of Kircheis’s friend on Phezzan since the issue had first come up. She had assumed that it had gone away. The idea that there continued to be someone feeding Leigh information from Phezzan was interesting, and she wished she could pry through what Elizabeth knew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure where the information comes from,” Hilde lied. “It probably did come from there, if the fleet office on Phezzan has been instructed to keep an eye out for Castrop running.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.” Elizabeth brushed some of her hair off her shoulder. “I’m deeply saddened to hear that your father is in trouble, but I’m not sure what I can do about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My family is allied to yours,” Hilde said. “I would like to formally request your assistance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know you should be asking my father. You said so yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Hilde said. “My father should be asking your father. But because my father is gone, and your father would likely pay me no mind, I must ask you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father would not ignore you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you ignore me, Lady Eizabeth?” Hilde had a sudden flash of imagination— picturing herself kneeling to ask Elizabeth’s aid. She brushed the thought out of her mind before it could show on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s too late for that. You make yourself very hard to ignore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have cornered you in your home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it that you actually want me to ask my father for? There aren’t that many resources that he could feasibly spend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like to go to Lord Castrop’s estate and try to negotiate for my father’s release.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need my father’s help for that, surely. You are capable of chartering passage on a ship yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, of course,” Hilde said. “But I do not expect that any pleading I do with Lord Castrop will be successful at all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why try?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I would like to remove my father from Lord Castrop’s prison by force, if necessary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Mariendorf, I can tell you with absolute certainty that my father would not dispatch his fleet against Lord Castrop. Not unless the Kaiser himself asked for it.” The cold and firm tone in her voice, and the switch to a much more formal address made Hilde feel despair for the first time in this conversation. Perhaps she should have relied on Captain Leigh to present her case to Duke Braunschweig, rather than asking herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not asking for a fleet, Lady Elizabeth,” Hilde said. “I know that isn’t on the table.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what is it that I can help you with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One ship,” Hilde said. “One ship to take me to Lord Castrop’s planet, and Captain Leigh and Sub-Lieutenant Kircheis to help me rescue my father. I don’t need a fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh is a personal friend of your father’s, isn’t he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, he is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth stared Hilde down, and Hilde straightened her back. “I like Captain Leigh very much,” Elizabeth said, finally. “But if you do not believe you will be successful in convincing Lord Castrop to release your father, what makes you think that Captain Leigh— without a fleet behind him— would be able to rescue him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh is a very talented man,” Hilde said. “He told me that he would do everything in his power to rescue my father, and I believe that is quite a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One man cannot do everything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Elizabeth— even if he fails, I would rather try than not try. If I do nothing, and my father dies, I won’t be able to live with myself. And neither will Captain Leigh. I know you can’t give me many resources, but with the ones that I can have— please. Let me try.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth continued to stare her down. “You make such a convincing case,” she said. “I’m moved by pity for you.” Her voice was still very cold, though. “But at the end of the day, I am not the one in charge of my father’s fleet and staff. And he relies on Captain Leigh being here with him. Especially since Captain Ansbach is still out in the corridor. I can’t decree that we will help you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you could convince your father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth stood from her languid sprawl on the couch, and walked over to the window. She looked much more imposing against the dim light. “He’ll ask what it will gain. And don’t tell me the Mariendorf family's loyalty, because if you fail, which is likely, the Mariendorf family will no longer have anything to offer me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth was asking about what could be offered to her father, but she referred only to herself. Hilde remembered Leigh’s comment about who would actually be sitting on the throne, and she felt a sudden thrill of fear, though it was accompanied by a firm feeling that she had made the right choice in asking Elizabeth for help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh believes that he can destroy the Artemis Necklace,” Hilde said. “If he does so, it will prove your family’s strength, and will certainly attract more people to your side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So much depends on Captain Leigh’s plans,” Elizabeth said. “We are putting so much faith in one strange man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde hesitated. “And, if he can’t do as he believes, it will prove that he’s not a reliable advisor,” she said. “You’ll have a better idea of what will be possible when you try to take the throne.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth considered this. “You make it sound like there’s nothing for me to lose by helping you. If that were really the case, you would have asked my mother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It will displease the crown,” Hilde said. “The Kaiser doesn't want this to become part of the squabble between you and the Littenheim family. But if you help my father, it will be seen as part of that conflict. Your mother would probably not enjoy adding fuel to that fire.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think I would?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You stand to gain much more than your mother does.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth tilted her head to look up at the stormy sky out the window. “You see things so clearly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So do you, my lady.” Hilde said nothing else, giving time for Elizabeth to think.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I do nothing, I will lose your friendship,” she said. “And that would be a pity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Though I would lose it equally as much if you failed in your quest. Only the living are helpful to me, I’m afraid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like to promise not to fail.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Elizabeth laugh. “You phrased that exactly like Captain Leigh would.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He has been an excellent teacher to me for many years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m aware. He serves my father well.” Her tone was neutral. “Why didn’t you ask him to plead on your behalf?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I like to handle my affairs myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You inherit, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope not for a long time, Lady Elizabeth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When you do, you don’t seem the type to have your husband manage your affairs for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Hilde said firmly. “The Mariendorf estates will be mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I admire that about you, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will be Kaiserine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Elizabeth smile, but it was a grim expression. “I will ask my father to loan you Captain Leigh, and a ship. On one condition.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh advises my father. I want </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> to advise </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde stood. “Lady Elizabeth— we hardly even know each other.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that a refusal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No— I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth came towards her, her skirt rustling. They were the same height, or Elizabeth was a little shorter. “I need someone who sees things clearly,” Elizabeth said, looking into Hilde’s eyes. “Someone who understands my world, and the rest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m honored that you think I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know why my father trusts Captain Leigh?” Elizabeth asked suddenly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because of his skill and his work with Iserlohn—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Elizabeth said. “That’s not it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s something that Captain Ansbach told him. Leigh is an outsider. He has nowhere else to go, and he has nothing to gain from playing games with my father.” She tilted her head and looked in Hilde’s eyes, and she reached out to tug on the lapel of Hilde’s suit. “You and Captain Leigh are not the same, of course, but I could trust you for the same reason. You clearly aren’t playing the games of the court the same way everyone else is, Hilde.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde’s heart beat faster, and she wasn’t sure what to say. “Of course, Lady Elizabeth. I’m happy to advise you in whatever ways I can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Provided you make it back from Lord Castrop’s planet,” Elizabeth said, her tone almost dismissive once again. She tapped Hilde’s chest, and then stepped away. “I’ll go speak to my father and Captain Leigh. You’ll have an answer by the end of the day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think your father will agree?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Elizabeth said. “I think I can be convincing when I need to be.”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Elizabeth was able to convince her father to loan Hilde a ship, but before they could truly start their journey, it was important for them to speak with Lord Castrop to make sure that the ship would not be shot down as it approached the planet. Within Odin’s FTL communications network, there was a block from the Imperial government on transmissions to and from Castrop’s planet— in a vain attempt to stop any more news of his rebellion spreading among the nobility. This only meant that speaking with Castrop had to be performed on the ship’s military ansible, once they left Odin’s starzone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship that Duke Braunschweig had loaned to Hilde was small, as far as Imperial battleships went, but to her, who had only been onboard passenger vessels, and then only rarely, it seemed unimaginably huge. And dreary. There were the usual swirled metal adornments on the walls and furniture, but rather than livening the vessel, it served to make every corner feel samey and disorienting. Kircheis and Leigh seemed immune to this, probably because they had spent so much time on identical cruisers, but it took Hilde a while to get used to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship could allow Hilde to transmit video from almost any room, but Captain Leigh decided that a better place for her to make her broadcast was from the bridge of the ship. The captain of the vessel was cajoled by Leigh (or ordered, but in the way that Leigh hardly ever made anything feel like an order) into giving up his chair briefly so that Hilde could be centered in the frame of the hidden bridge camera. She felt distinctly uncomfortable and out of place among all the soldiers performing their usual duties. It wouldn’t have felt like anything if she had been wearing her usual clothes, but she knew that the impression she was going to make on Castrop was an important one, so she was wearing a dress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The only impression that she wanted to give was that she was a dutiful daughter of a respectable Imperial family— harmless but sincere. Someone who perhaps had something to offer, but was not in a position to make threats.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh and Kircheis were outside the camera’s view. Leigh was perched cross-legged on one of the computer consoles, having displaced the fire control technician who usually sat there, telling him to go take a break, since there was no way this ship would be engaging in battle for the foreseeable future. Kircheis stood next to him, and he offered Hilde a smile, though he held himself so stiffly that it didn’t reach his eyes like it usually did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sitting in the captain’s chair, waiting for the call to Castrop to connect, Hilde fidgeted in her seat, trying to arrange herself comfortably, to look proper on the little monitoring display she could see on the communication technician’s console. The little image, with its unnatural white balance, looked like a stranger. But then she didn’t have time to check her image anymore, because the call went through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was surprised that it was Castrop who appeared on the screen, projected far larger than life on the screen at the front of the bridge. Kircheis turned to look at him, but Leigh kept looking at Hilde, with his soft gaze. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like her, Castrop was seated, but he was outdoors, on some tiled patio, with a fine breeze lifting his light blonde hair. He, unlike Hilde, seemed very comfortable, and he smiled at the camera.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Castrop,” Hilde said, “thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I’ve been trying to do so for days, but communications from Odin are blocked.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Mariendorf, how could I miss the opportunity? Especially since you’ve come so far— you’ve had to come all the way to space, I can see. Such a strange environment to see a young lady in. But what is it that you need to speak with meso urgently about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t heard from my father,” she said. “I wanted to make sure that he is alright.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father? Count Mariendorf is quite well. As you said yourself, communications from Odin are blocked. It’s been quite inconvenient.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I see him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid he’s busy at the moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde got impatient. “Doing what?” she asked, but immediately regretted it. Castrop’s face twitched in displeasure, and he reached out of frame— when his hand came back into view he was holding a glass of wine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s touring some of my estate,” Castrop said. “I think he’s been enjoying the weather here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he planning to return to Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not soon, no.” Castrop smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Castrop—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Lady Mariendorf?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand that it might be difficult for merchant freighters like the one my father traveled in on to visit your planet, considering the situation. I was wondering if it might be possible for me to offer my father a ride home on this ship, which Duke Braunscheig has been kind enough to lend me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would come all the way out here?” Lord Castrop asked. “That’s quite a journey for a young woman.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My family’s estate is further from Odin than your planet is, Lord Castrop. If I’m to be my father’s heir then I have to get used to traveling, especially if I want to help him with his work, either on our estate or his political work.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Politics and managing the land are difficult tasks, I’m surprised your father would want you to get involved. Do you think if I asked him, he would want you to involve yourself in these politics?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father trusts me,” Hilde said simply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop took a long drink of his wine, nearly draining the cup. He left just a mouthful, to swirl around in the glass, leaving a red film on the glass, which dripped down in rivulets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you would also like to come and visit my beautiful planet, I’m always happy to have guests, especially those who have some political task from Odin. How could I refuse?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Lord Castrop,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde didn’t say anything, just waited for Castrop to make his demand, whatever it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop seemed a little frustrated by her silence, putting down his wine glass hard enough on the table before him that it made an audible clink. “Of course,” Castrop said, “I can’t allow your whole ship to land, unfortunately. I don’t have guest bedrooms for a few hundred of Duke Braunscheig’s soldiers. I only have room for you, Lady Mariendorf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand, Lord Castrop,” Hilde said. She hadn’t expected much different. “May I bring a small entourage with me, down on the shuttle. Guards, and such?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Castrop said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For my safety, please, you must understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” he said again. “Do you understand the word? I only want a small number of guests.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had fully expected that this request would be denied. Castrop obviously wouldn’t want her to bring down a cadre of soldiers who might be able to storm his house and kill him. Some shuttles were quite large, and could fit a good number of men.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I at least bring one single person as an escort?” she asked, trying to put a pleading, helpless note in her voice. She didn’t think she was good at it. “I’m a lady, and a lady should have an escort.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This did give Castrop a single moment of pause, and he said, “And who would that be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde gestured to Kircheis, and he stepped forward into the view of the camera. Castrop’s eyes roved over his image, taking in his youth, the lack of rank in his uniform. “This is Sub-lieutenant Kircheis,” Hilde said. “He’s a friend of my father’s.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop was silent for a long moment. “Fine,” he said. “If you really believe yourself to be in need of someone to protect you. But I assure you, Lady Mariendorf, no harm would come to you while you’re my guest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for the assurance, Lord Castrop. I’m sure that you are a most gracious host.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Since the whole idea for the trip had been conceived and shoved into motion so quickly, Leigh spent the first couple days cloistered in his room, poring over every scrap of material that was available on Lord Castrop. He monopolized the ship’s FTL communications, using them to connect remotely to any data source he had access to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde saw him at dinner, and, on the first day, he passed her a stack of scribbled notes to peruse, things that he thought might be useful to her, specifically. These notes contained takeaways that Leigh had gathered about Castrop’s personality, mostly what tacks might be useful in negotiating with him. Hilde looked them over dutifully, and hoped that they would come to good use, but she doubted it. None of the anecdotes in the dossier created an image of a man who liked to negotiate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What seemed much more pressing was Leigh’s analysis of Castrop’s military strength. Did he have any troops aside from scant police forces used to keep his population in line? From aerial views of the planet— the only information that was available— what could be gleaned about where Count Mariendorf was being held prisoner? And the Artemis Necklace— the question that hovered over everything, like the satellites in the sky above the blue and green world— what would be required to destroy it?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh didn’t discuss things with her until he had fully gone over the available material, though she didn’t know why he waited. If this had been any other subject, he would have been happy to walk her through his thought processes as they happened— he was a natural teacher, and she knew he enjoyed having her as a student— but perhaps the subject was too close and painful for the both of them. She knew how much Leigh respected her father, but she had retained the childish understanding of Leigh’s presence in her life as being part of </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> life, and not her father’s. That changed, when she saw how drawn Leigh’s face was at dinner when they ate together in the small mess hall. She decided to allow Leigh his time, and not pester him in his office, though she burned with curiosity and her own anxieties.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they came closer to Castrop’s planet, finally Leigh called her and Kircheis to meet and discuss their plans. They sat down in his office, across from his desk, utilitarian and sparse— Leigh hadn’t had time to make the room his own mess yet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll be at Castrop’s planet in a couple days,” Leigh said. “I think— I have something resembling a plan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis nodded. Leigh ran his hand through his hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure it’s a good one,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not,” Leigh replied. “I don’t think that there is a good plan. I’m tempted to say that it’s too dangerous, and that we should just wait for the Kaiser to send in his fleet, but I know you won’t accept that answer, so here is the best that I can do with what I have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re right about that,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father wouldn’t want you to be here,” Leigh pointed out. “He wouldn’t want me or Sub-lieutenant Kircheis to be here either. And I know that if anything happens to you, he’ll never forgive me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh,” she said, which made Leigh make a sad expression— she usually called him Hank. “Why are you saying all of this? I already know that, and it’s not going to change my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I know that you would never forgive me if I gave you a plan that was safer to yourself that had less of a chance of success,” Leigh said. “Or, if I did do that, you wouldn’t follow it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is the plan, sir?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh sighed, and slid a thick folder full of information across the table to Kircheis, who flipped it open. The first thing in the stack was an overhead view of Castrop’s home area, which was atop a large hill, and made up of clusters of rectangular buildings, all around winding roads. Different buildings were labeled, as well as the airfield on the outskirts of the area, and some other relevant features. Kircheis continued to flip through the stack of information, and came to photographs of Castrop’s personal ship, which was seen on the ground on the airfield in the aerial view, as well as engineering drawings of the layout of the ship. Overall, there was quite a lot of information available, more than Hilde had expected to have at her disposal, but there was only so far that information could go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Kircheis finished flipping through the stack without reading it fully, Leigh began to speak. He was trying to slip back into his favorite lecture mode, but the cracks kept showing in his voice, a certain hesitation that Hilde had never heard before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” he began. “I think that you gathered from Castrop’s personality that he’s unlikely to release your father, even if you offer money, or protection, or anything else. I would like to say that the plan should be to find where your father is being kept, and to simply break him out. Lord Castrop does have a prison on his planet, which is mainly for the locals.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh made a face as he said this, though Hilde suspected this was just Leigh’s opinion about Castrop’s rule of law on his planet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh continued. “I don’t know if your father is being kept there. From what I’ve been told, security isn’t that tight, but it’s also not something that I would feel confident sending you into.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you say that security isn’t that tight?” Hilde asked. “How do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As a ruler, outside of his private amusements and his Necklace, Castrop is a technophobe, from what I can tell. He keeps control of the populace with his private police, and by keeping tools out of the hands of the people. You can see on the overview” —he gestured for Kircheis to give him the folder of images, and flipped to the satellite view, where he pointed out solar farms— “that power is only generated through solar, and primarily near his estate and for specific other uses elsewhere. This is, for most people living on it, a world lit only by fire. I think it’s a pretty common tactic— Duke Braunschwieg does the same on some of his planets, I’m led to understand. But this means that a prison that just has locking doors with physical keys and guards with guns is sufficient in most cases.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good for us,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would be good if you had more than just yourselves to work with. I’m not going to suggest you perform a break-in there. And, as I said, I don’t know if your father is even being held there.” He shook his head. “Lord Castrop seems like the type of man who might keep your father close by him, rather than treating him like an ordinary person. He’s useful as a hostage, and so that gives him some status, for whatever that’s worth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, what do you suggest?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Obviously, if you see a good opportunity to break your father out, I don’t think I could dissuade you from taking it. But I don’t want to rely on that.” He closed his eyes for a second. “So, the negotiations are likely to fail, and it’s unlikely that you will be able to rescue your father outright. But there are alternatives.” He opened his eyes and looked at Kircheis. “Sub-lieutenant— your duty is to see if there is any technical information that you can glean about the Artemis Necklace. I doubt that Phezzan has left Castrop with books and books of documentation, and I doubt that the control room is something that you can break into. But anything you can learn and communicate to me will be helpful. I really do mean anything. Even if you can get Castrop to demonstrate firing it, that will give me an indication of where the satellites that control it are. Right now, they’re all disguised as part of the asteroid cloud around the planet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I can destroy the Necklace with that information, then Castrop will run, and he will take your father with him. Because your father will be a hostage, we won’t be able to attack his ship directly. So we need another way…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From the stack of papers, Leigh pulled out the diagram of Lord Castrop’s ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is a merchant freighter, with a fresh coat of paint. I think Lord Castrop has either had it for many years, or he got it cheaply— it’s an old model.” There was a strange tone in Leigh’s voice. “It’s the same class of ship my father used. I’m very familiar with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde raised her eyebrows, but said nothing. She didn’t know anything about Leigh’s family. Kircheis’s eyes were wide.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From his pocket, Leigh pulled out a data stick. He held it out to the two of them, and it was Hilde who took it. “What’s this?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This class of ships has a known flaw in the engine design,” he said. “It’s been mitigated with software keeping various parameters within very strict limits, but it is only software, and it can be changed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The data stick suddenly felt warm in Hilde’s hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh leaned back in his seat, tilting his face towards the ceiling. His voice was strained. “If you break onto his ship, and install this program, his ship will become a bomb, on a time limit. We’ll tell him that, when he flees. And if he wants to live, he’ll have to abandon ship. He’ll take your father with him on the shuttle for protection, bargaining power, whatever he thinks he can get. But we’ll be able to pick them up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where did you get this, sir?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phezzan,” Leigh said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your spy?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh cracked open his eyes and looked down his nose at her. “If I answered that question, I would be doing everyone a disservice, Hilde.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh closed his eyes again. “Don’t apologize. I would ask the same question. I just wouldn’t expect an answer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Kircheis said. “We can do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I doubt that you’ll be able to communicate with me once you land. The cloud of asteroids around the planet is a pretty effective radio blocker, and your shuttle doesn’t have an ansible that would cut through it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s unfortunate,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Leigh replied. “I wish I could go with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright, sir,” Kircheis said. “We’ll take care of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you will,” Leigh said. He sighed and sat straight in his chair. “I’m not going to make you promise not to take too many risks, and to come back alive, and to leave immediately if things seem to be going wrong. I know you can’t promise that to me. But I hope that you will take care of yourselves first. It’s what your father would want for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, sir,” Hilde said. She appreciated Leigh’s directness and honesty, and his willingness to take her seriously. He always would have, but it stood out to her more than it ever had before. She felt a strange sadness looking at him— so dejected in his chair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a good plan, sir,” Kircheis said. “Thank you for putting it all together for us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh nodded, and said nothing more.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilde and Kircheis didn’t bring much in the way of luggage with them in the shuttle down to Castrop’s planet— they had absolutely no intention of staying for any longer than they had to— so all that was packed in the back of their shuttle were minimal supplies. Some of it was disguised as a standard toolkit that any shuttle would have, one for performing repairs on the outside of battleships. They had brought weapons, but those were hidden beneath the metal floor panels of the shuttle, though they would probably be found if the ship was to be searched. They were going to have to be unarmed as they went into Castrop’s estate proper to negotiate, but that couldn’t be helped. And because they were planning to go directly to his estate after landing, Hilde was forced to wear an outfit that had been chosen for her talks with Castrop all the way down onto the planet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hated the dress that she had forced herself into. She chose it, but that didn’t make it feel any less like a horrible costume on her. Its only benefit was that, among its voluminous fabrics, she could easily and undetectably carry Leigh’s destructive program for Castrop’s ship. Even still, she was immensely jealous of Kircheis, who wore his uniform. Her constant fidgeting with the ruffles of the skirt and the constricting bodice made him glance over at her in silent sympathy as they rode the shuttle down to the surface.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis didn’t need to pilot the shuttle, although he had taken a minimal course on doing so. The shuttle flew on autopilot, nimbly weaving through the chunks of rock that circled the planet in a cloud, not yet a complete ring like gas giants often had. All this rock must have once been a moon or a large asteroid that had been broken up under tidal forces, or on purpose by man. Hilde didn’t know the history of this world, and so couldn’t say for sure. But as they came closer to it, it became clear that it wasn’t just rocks, but also a thick cloud of dust, one that caught the light from the star and spun it in through the windows of the shuttle, glinting and glaring as they descended into the atmosphere.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The planet was a rich one, at least in terms of its environment. In the fertile latitudes, farms wrapped the ground like a patchwork blanket, all greens and yellows of different shades. There were wilder parts, as well, forests that sprawled dark and wide across the equator, and broad rivers, and lakes so large they could have been seas. It was a beautiful planet, one that some past Kaiser must have given as a very lavish reward to some very loyal servant, far back in the Castrop line. Ironic, now, how such a thing could compel a son of that line to rebel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they flew closer to Castrop’s home, the only place on the planet that resembled a city even slightly, Hilde took note of the low lying areas surrounding the hill upon which the city was built. The airfield was in the only flat area on the outskirts, so passing low over the city for a landing gave a chance to view the architecture close up. It was fairly different from the usual Imperial style— it looked like something out of one of Leigh’s history textbooks about Ancient Earth. It was Roman, or trying to be— all marble-columned buildings and cobblestone pathways winding between public squares where fountains could be seen, with pedestrians gathering around them, like little ants from this height.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The landing in the airfield was smooth, but before Hilde could even rearrange the fabric of her skirt and prepare herself mentally to step out, men on horseback were trotting up to surround their shuttle. They wore some sort of faux historical uniform— not Fleet, that was for sure. Castrop certainly seemed to fancy himself as a reenactor of something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t like the look of this,” Hilde muttered as she unfastened her seatbelt and clambered towards the back of the shuttle where the door was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At least it shows we’re guests that Lord Castrop is paying attention to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde forced a smile onto her face, or at least the kind of steely expression that Lady Elizabeth was so good at. She opened the door of the shuttle and stepped out, followed swiftly by Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The air was deliciously warm, after being in the dry and sterile confines of ships for their trip, and this almost made Hilde not think about the smell, drifting in on the wind from the city— a heady combination of ocean water, growing things, and shit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soldiers on their horses did not dismount.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Mariendorf?” one asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” she said. “Are you here to escort me to see Lord Castrop?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If my lord wishes to see you,” the soldier said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is my companion, Siegfried Kircheis. He will be accompanying me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If my lord allows it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde wanted to make a remark about how if Castrop did not want them on his planet, then they would have been shot from the sky, but that seemed like an imprudent thing to say, so instead she just smiled. “We spoke with Lord Castrop, and there was no problem with my companion joining me. Lord Castrop seemed happy to negotiate with me about my father’s continued presence on this planet. I hope that hasn’t changed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guard, or whatever his role was, shrugged. “Your chariot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From down the airfield, there came a clattering of wheels, and a horse drawn chariot came into sight, painted a gaudy gold and red. Although Hilde hated it, she realized that the alternative might have been more embarrassing for her: in her current outfit, she would have found it difficult to ride a horse properly. She smiled grimly, and let Kircheis help her into the chariot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as they were loaded in, they left the airfield. She felt like she was abandoning all sense of control— behind them, guards were inspecting their shuttle, and she doubted that it would remain closed and where they left it while they were gone. And even if it did, they would need to rely on Castrop’s transportation— horses, apparently— to bring them to and from the airfield. It wasn’t a short journey from the outskirts of the city to the peak of the hill on which Castrop’s mansion sat like a temple.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they drove, Hilde could see more clearly the way life was in this city, on this planet. The streets were full of pedestrians who all dodged out of the way of the guards and horses as they trampled though. Most people looked impoverished, though the closer they drew towards the center of the city, the cleaner it all became. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop had clearly styled his land after ancient Rome, but the temples that they passed bore the familiar visages of the Imperial gods and goddesses— Odin and Thor and the rest— just done in white marble and in this strange setting. Everyone dressed in togas, or chitons maybe, Hilde had never paid much attention to historical costuming. Most people wore sandals. The ugly smells of people packed together persisted, and mingled with smoke from ovens and other house fires, and the manure of animals.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though, for the most part, there didn’t appear to be much in the way of technology, the guards who accompanied them carried modern sidearms, and the closer they came to Castrop’s estate, winding their way up the hill, the more buildings had solar panels outfitted on the roofs. Hilde even saw a motorcycle parked next to one lavish house, and she silently pointed it out to Kircheis as their chariot clattered past.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole thing painted a disturbing picture. It was not very much like the Mariendorf family holdings, which she had been to many times in her life. Those were modest, but the scattered towns all had access to power, and her father had endeavored to make sure that there were doctors and schools and all the necessities for the people on his land to live their lives. As far as Hilde knew, this arrangement had suited him as a landlord, and the people just as well. If Castrop felt the need to control his population by taking away even the barest standards of modern life— it seemed completely unreasonable to her. But she bit her lip: she wasn’t here to save Castrop’s people, just her father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A dark thought crossed her mind. Perhaps this treason had been planned for many years. After all, in a world that was primarily agricultural, to keep a modern technological standard of living, one would have to import quite a lot. If Castrop knew that, he might have taken steps to reduce the amount that he would have to import to keep his planet running, by preemptively reducing his population’s needs. Or ignoring them, anyway, and forcing them to get used to it. But maybe she was assigning more credit for forethought than Castrop really deserved. After all, Leigh had said that Duke Braunschweig ran some of his estates in a similar way, and it seemed unlikely that he was doing so to prepare to take an independent stand against the crown. It must have just been cheaper. And nothing, it seemed, was cheaper than the life of one of the people living in these estates.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt observed as they drove by. People were leaning out their windows to stare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop’s home was the same white marble, an illusion of cleanliness at the top of the hill. It was styled after a temple, but it was his house, and nothing else. The guards led her and Kircheis inside. It was dim, with air flowing cool through the hallways— the building had an almost open layout; past the columns on the outside holding the roof there were wide hallways that opened directly to the outdoors and provided natural ventilation. The ceilings were cavernously tall, and Hilde wondered if the builders had deigned to use modern equipment to put it all together, or if it had been done by teams of workers toiling by hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde and Kircheis were instructed to wait in an antechamber, and were not given any indication of how long they could expect to be waiting for. They didn’t sit down on the cushions provided, and just stood next to each other, facing the door, waiting for something to happen. She could tell how nervous Kircheis was by how stiffly he held his arms. But he didn’t say anything, and neither did she.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wait felt like an eternity, with the only indication of time the lengthening of the shadows on the floor of the room, and checking Kircheis’ watch. The minutes crawled by— half an hour, forty-five minutes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After Hilde began to wonder if they would ever be summoned or spoken to, guards reappeared and instructed them to follow. They were brought through the house, much further, out to the back of the building, where the sound of instruments playing began to drift through the air: lyres and flutes, or something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They emerged onto a back balcony area, which looked down over the reach of the city. The sun was going down, and the temperature was dropping, the wind picking up. These were the things that Hilde noticed first. But then she saw Lord Castrop, reclining at the front of a feast laid out, and then she saw her father, who saw her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father was unharmed, or at least he didn’t seem injured. But the clothes that he was dressed in were rumpled, and his beard was coming in, the growth of quite a few days. He sat at Castrop’s left side, and when he saw Hilde, his face turned pale as a sheet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How good of you to join us, Lady Mariendorf!” Lord Castrop said. “I’m so pleased that you could come all this way. Take a seat, be my guest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were other people seated on cushions all around, in front of their own bowls of food and goblets of wine, but they were silent, and looked at Hilde warily as she came forward to take a seat at the indicated place. The few musicians at the side of the party kept playing, not lifting their eyes to look at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis followed Hilde, but Castrop snapped, “I didn’t invite the retainer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde looked at Kircheis with wide eyes, but he just silently stepped back to stand against one of the pillars near the guards. This seemed to satisfy Castrop, and so Hilde continued forward. She was seated at Castrop’s right side, across from her father. He looked at her, and his expression was so sorrowful that she couldn’t meet his eyes. She hadn’t realized how terrible it would feel to see her father not want her there. She understood that it was because he feared for her safety, but that only hardened the resolve in her heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Castrop was a large man, wearing a toga. His face was round and young looking, though Hilde knew he was in his thirties, and his hair was a fine and wispy blonde, much more like half the Imperial court than the pictures she had seen of the antiquity that he was trying to mimic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Castrop,” she said as she settled down onto the cushion, “thank you for allowing me to visit your charming planet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Castrop said. “I’m pleased that you find it charming. I hope that you will enjoy it as my guest for a while.” He lazily reached out and took some grapes from a platter before him, eating them, oddly, two at a time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I’m not planning to stay for long, Lord Castrop,” Hilde said. “The ship that I borrowed from Duke Braunschweig has other places to be, so I can’t linger, as much as your planet is beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a shame. I do so enjoy having guests. Your father has been an interesting one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In what way?” Hilde asked. She didn’t want to set Castrop off by leaping to state that her father was clearly a prisoner, so she had to play along. It grated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He keeps trying to give me advice! It’s very funny! No one who knows me well ever tries to give me advice!” He laughed. This was what made Hilde realize that he was already drunk. “Perhaps that’s why I’ve kept him around. It’s so unusual to hear things that sound like jokes, delivered so sincerely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father has always had a good sense of humor,” Hilde said. “Though I’m afraid that he also has business back on Odin that he will need to get to. I’m sure he’ll miss your company when he goes. It’s always nice to have someone who laughs at your jokes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have not been laughing, Lady Mariendorf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eat.” Castrop pointed at the food in front of her. “I don’t ever like to talk on an empty stomach.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She obeyed, taking some of the fruit and bread and meat set out in trays before her. She glanced at her father for confirmation that she should eat, and he hastily took some food too. Castrop didn’t say anything to stop him. So, Hilde ate. The food, admittedly, was delicious, and the wine was bright and sweet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they ate, the room filled up with slight chatter from the other guests at the meal, but Hilde couldn’t hear their conversations well enough to know if they were important. She glanced at the back of the gathering towards Kircheis, to see if anyone had given him something to eat, but they hadn’t, so he was just standing at attention near one of the pillars, watching everything. She felt bad for him, but considered that he probably also felt bad for her. No one interrupted Castrop while he was eating, and Hilde didn’t dare to either. When he had finished, or at least satisfied himself enough that he was willing to talk, he washed his hands in a bowl that a servant brought over, and then turned to Hilde.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you enjoy your meal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Lord Castrop. Your planet is as bountiful as it is beautiful, clearly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So very true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde put down her wine glass. “Lord Castrop, I would like to speak to you plainly. I understand that you are a busy man, and so I shouldn’t waste your time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Mariendorf, we have nothing but time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid that’s not the case, Lord Castrop.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why not?” He laughed. “Maybe you’re a little too used to the rush of the way things are done in the capital. Here we take things at a much easier pace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s true that I am very used to life on Odin,” she said. “As is my father, and he would very much like to return there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so, Count Mariendorf? I haven’t heard a word of complaint from you as my guest. Have I been a poor host?” He looked over at Hilde’s father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like to return home with my daughter,” he said. His voice was rough, either with the strain of seeing Hilde, or with disuse. “If that is agreeable to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I would be left without any friendly company to remind me of life on Odin,” Castrop said, exaggerating his amicable tone. “Since you say that I’m never likely to be allowed to return there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Castrop, if you allow my father to leave and return to Odin, he can negotiate with the crown on your behalf. All of these problems can be solved—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no desire to negotiate with the crown!” Castrop snapped. “Why would I want anyone to negotiate for me? I’ve made myself perfectly clear. There’s no power in the universe that will compel me to bow. I’m tired of bowing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde sat up straighter and did not let herself be cowed by Castrop’s tone. “Even as we speak, there’s a fleet of ships waiting to come here and kill you. If you negotiate, you might live.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Such harsh threats from such a beautiful young woman. Lady Mariendorf, isn’t it obvious that I’m not scared of the Kaiser’s fleets in the least?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pardon me for being presumptuous, but you should be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your jokes are just as funny as your father’s.” Castrop was no longer laughing, but his cheeks were red with alcohol and anger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Castrop, I don’t mean at all to insult the life you’ve built here, and the Necklace that protects your planet. I’m sure that it’s quite impressive—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But there are many, many clever men in the Kaiser’s employ, and millions of ships at their disposal. You’re going to force the Kaiser’s hand to make an example of you— and he will do whatever it takes to bring your lands back under Imperial control.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He can try. You haven’t seen how powerful my Necklace is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you think a demonstration will change my mind, I’d be happy to see it,” Hilde said, remembering that Leigh wanted a test-fire of the device. “I could communicate that to the Kaiser on your behalf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps you will get to see one, Lady Mariendorf. At this moment, I lack appropriate targets. I’m told the ship you came in on is waiting out of my reach. A pity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde blanched. “Lord Castrop, you’re a funny man as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I? I don’t hear any laughter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Haha,” Hilde tried, but it came out hollow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Much better.” He picked up a pear that had been sliced in half, and ate it in dainty little bites that nevertheless caused juice to drip down his hand and chin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Castrop, if you want to continue to take a stand against the crown, I can’t stop you,” Hilde said. “But I beg of you to let my father return to Odin. If I cannot negotiate with the crown on your behalf, is there anything else I can offer you to allow him to leave?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop took a long time to finish his pear. “Certainly there’s something you can offer me, Lady Mariendorf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde leaned forward. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your father is a valuable guest,” he said. “I would need something equally valuable in exchange. But it seems to me that you have some power independent of your father: you said it was Duke Braunschweig who brought you here, correct?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He loaned me the ship, yes. If there’s anything you want me to negotiate with the duke for—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no,” Castrop said. “I have no need for anything of Duke Braunschweig’s. If I wanted things from him, I would be his friend.” Hilde waited for Castrop to elaborate on what it was that he wanted. Castrop stared at her, and she kept her back straight and didn’t shift in her seat. “But if you have that much power, perhaps you’re just as valuable as your father is. I would be happy to have you as a guest in his place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” her father said. “I will not let you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Silence,” Lord Castrop said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde looked into her father’s eyes for a second. He seemed on the verge of tears. Hilde kept her face still. “I’m afraid I have too much business on Odin,” Hilde said. “I don’t have much time to stay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Such a pity. You’re certain that I can’t convince you to be my guest for a little while longer?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If my father is unable to do it, I think it is my duty to report your feelings to the crown.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think the crown is perfectly well aware of my feelings. You said that as we speak, there is a fleet being ordered in this direction.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The crown still will expect an answer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It will have one, then,” Castrop said. “A pity that you will be the one to give it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop just smiled. “When will you be leaving, then, Lady Mariendorf? Surely you’ll at least wait until tomorrow morning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glanced behind herself at Kircheis, still waiting at the back. He made no reaction whatsoever, staring straight ahead and pretending not to pay attention. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like to discuss that with my retainer, if I could,” she said, though she was sure that they wanted to get out of here as quickly as possible. She had a feeling that the longer she stayed in Castrop’s estate, the more danger she would be in. “And I would like to speak with my father, since I don’t know when I’ll get to see him again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Castrop said. “How could I refuse a request like that? But first, you must watch my dancers.” He clapped his hands, and there was a flurry of movement from within the building. Dancers in bright  costumes emerged, and the whole party turned to watch them. The time for talk was clearly over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The musicians struck up a more energetic tune, now, and the dancers twirled around and around. Hilde didn’t really want to watch— the display made her feel deeply uncomfortable. The dancers oriented their whole performance towards Castrop, ignoring the rest of the guests and making sure that Castrop had the only real view of their movements— they danced in between the front where Hilde was sitting and the rest of the banquet guests, and they divested themselves of their layers of fluttery fabric one at a time, the music growing faster and faster, so much so that Hilde was sure that it had to end soon, somehow, but it kept going. Castrop was enthralled with the performance, drinking another glass of wine while following every step. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde wanted to look away. The sun was setting, and she saw someone walking around to torches on the edge of the gathering, ignored by everyone else. Her eyes followed this servant instead, his slow trek around the periphery, the torchlight an easier dance to watch than the women.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the prolonged dance performance had finally finished, the dancers all sat down on the cushions next to Castrop, which gave a handy excuse for Hilde and her father to get up. Castrop waved them off, and Hilde was allowed to speak with her father and Kircheis in a room by themselves. But there were guards outside, and the walls were the same open style the whole house was built from, so Hilde doubted they had much privacy at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This didn’t stop her father from sweeping her up in a crushing hug the moment they were ostensibly alone. “Hilde, my darling,” he said, “what are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I came to get you out of here,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You shouldn’t have come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t sit around and do nothing,” she said. “Captain Leigh is on the ship in orbit. We’re— it’s going to be okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He lowered his voice. “He has a plan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said. “Though you might have to remain with Lord Castrop for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” her father said. “Thank you for not trying to trade yourself for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde frowned. “Don’t say things like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his head, then, with his voice quiet again, he asked, “What are you going to do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde flicked her eyes to the open entrance of the room. Her father nodded. It didn’t hurt to be too cautious. “I think we’re going to have to go back to Captain Leigh,” she said, though she tried to make it clear to her father that she was lying, or at least not telling the whole truth. “Probably as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It might be difficult,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think—” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think Lord Castrop has your best interests at heart,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you did ask for a demonstration of the Necklace,” her father added.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde frowned. “Well, we’ll figure something out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t do anything to put yourself in danger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a little too late for that,” she said, but her tone was soft and wry. “You can trust me and Sieg and Hank.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you been treated alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Lord Castrop’s guest. He has good reason to keep me healthy, at least until he doesn’t need me anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s… good,” Kircheis said. “I’m sorry that it came to this in the first place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew what the risks were when I came here. It’s not just soldiers who have to do difficult things for the crown.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you be okay when we leave?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As long as I know you’re alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t like leaving you here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever you have to do, I don’t want you thinking about me to stop you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t help thinking about you. I love you. But I’ll stay safe. I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hugged her again, stroking her hair, and they could hear the sound of the guards moving in the hallway.  They had only been allotted a short meeting.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilde and Kircheis were escorted back to their shuttle. In the flickering light of the torches carried by the guards, their shadows stretched long across the airfield. As they got ready to depart, Hilde looked around the airfield carefully, noting where the few buildings and radars were, where the guards stood, and where Lord Castrop’s ship sat, like a squat, gaudy monstrosity, parked on the edge of the field. It was surely locked tight, and they would need to figure out some way inside it. She and Kircheis hadn’t gotten a chance to speak, but she was suspecting that they were formulating the same plan. She leaned on the side of the shuttle, while Kircheis walked all around it, making a visual inspection to see how much, if any, it had been tampered with, and if it was safe to fly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He decided that it was safe. This didn’t surprise Hilde, after all, Castrop clearly wanted to demonstrate shooting them down, which he could only do if they were airborne. So they got in. Kircheis also checked the inside of the shuttle for signs of tampering, but all of their supplies appeared exactly where they had been left, and nothing seemed amiss. So, he was confident enough that their shuttle hadn’t been bugged that he was willing to speak aloud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Castrop’s going to shoot this shuttle down as soon as it gets out of the atmosphere and into the Necklace’s range,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” There was only one thing that they could do, really. “We’ll have to ditch the shuttle somewhere, and then come back to break into Castrop’s ship, once there aren’t guards around here waiting for us to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll probably have to ditch somewhere far away so that it’s not obvious. It’s going to be a hike.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How far?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They don’t have a lot of radar coverage, since they don’t have that much air traffic at all.” Kircheis said, pointing outside the shuttle window to the singular radar on a tower at the edge of the airfield, slowly spinning. “So we might be able to get away with it relatively close, especially if we make it look like we’re doing some sort of low flying survey, and keep dropping in and out of their sensor coverage. This whole area is hilly, which will help. All we need to do is get behind some terrain.” He bit his lip. “I’ll keep us as close as we can stay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right. Once we get back—” She paused and looked out the shuttle’s front window, pointing at Castrop’s ship. “Do we have any good ways of breaking in there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll have to set up a watch and see if they ever open the doors. There’s no way to enter it unless the ramp is lowered. Maybe… Once Captain Leigh destroys the Necklace, they’ll have to load on supplies. When they’re doing that…” He shook his head. “Let’s solve this problem first.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned towards the console and started tapping in commands for the autopilot. The shuttle began its pre-launch sequence, and when Kircheis finished, they began to taxi down the airfield and leap into the sky. As soon as they were airborne, Hilde got out of her seat and began collecting all their supplies into bags that they could carry, sorting what they might be able to use, and what would be too heavy to haul around. She retrieved the guns from their hidden places beneath the floor panels.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis had the shuttle fly in widening, low circles, pretending to survey the land. As the circle widened, he dropped the shuttle lower and lower to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll have to get out as quickly as possible,” he said. “So that it looks like we’re just continuing our flight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And the shuttle will take off again once we’re out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, do some more circles, and then head up into space.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where it’s going to be destroyed.” Hilde frowned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At least we’ll be able to give Leigh some data,” Kircheis said. “I’ll have the shuttle do a couple tests. The Necklace is surrounded by rocks, and some of those are bigger than this shuttle, and those aren’t setting it off. Once it’s right out of the atmosphere, I’ll make it accelerate just enough to put it inside that asteroid field, but keep its engine off for a while. The Necklace might do a bunch of its target discrimination based on infrarad and engine emissions. Radio, too. I’ll have it keep radio silent, and then run a few test transmissions to Captain Leigh. And if it survives all that— I’ll have it try to go join Captain Leigh’s ship again. Do some odd maneuvers, see how the Necklace responds. I don’t think there’s anyone on the ground controlling it— it seems like it’s a completely automated system, and Captain Leigh might be able to use that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Hilde said. “I hope that’s enough for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll be able to figure something out,” Kircheis said. Hilde appreciated his sure tone— Kircheis was always so steady, and that reassured her. His refusal to let fear into his voice made it feel almost like being back at school with him, like they could have been playing some wargame in Captain Leigh’s class, rather than risking their lives. She wondered if his confidence was real, or if his calmness was something that he practiced putting on like a cloak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned his attention back to the land that they were flying over, and picked a good spot to land the shuttle so that they could disembark. Off in the distance was some empty pastureland, which seemed like the best they were going to get.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shuttle touched down easily, engaging its vertical landing mode, and settled onto the scraggly, windblown grass. As quickly as she could, Hilde hauled out their small bags of gear, tossing them out onto the ground, and Kircheis entered the last autopilot commands. They scrambled out of the shuttle and grabbed the bags, and ran off down the hill as fast as they could to get away from the shuttle as its engines revved up again, and it slowly lifted into the night sky without them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As its noise and engine glow receded up into the darkness, Hilde felt her stomach sink. Even if the shuttle was doomed, which it probably was, it still represented their only way off the planet, and there it was, flying away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Hilde said. “Which direction are we walking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis dug through one of their bags, pulling out their maps and compass, and compared them to the coordinates that their shuttle had reported them to be at. Hilde held a flashlight over the papers, which fluttered in the light breeze as Kircheis did the triangulation, and faced them in the right direction. “This way,” he said. “But we’ll probably want to stay away from the towns we flew over. But we can use the roads for most of it. I doubt there’s much traffic. We’ll just need to hide if anyone comes by.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Hilde said. She hesitated for a moment, then asked, “How far away are we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fifty kilometers,” Kircheis said. “Maybe we should have risked going closer.” For the first time, Hilde heard something other than confidence in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It gives Hank time to destroy the Necklace,” she said. “Let’s start walking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe we should go closer to a town— we can steal some horses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was a practical suggestion, but Hilde found it inexplicably funny, and she laughed as she stumbled down the rest of the hill, forced to hike up her skirt to be able to move. But now that she was walking, the outfit didn’t bother her as much— she felt more herself out here hiking across the pasture than she had so far on this trip. “Let’s try it,” she said. “If we see any.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Kircheis said as he followed her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he came up beside her, she gave him a grim smile, and he gave one back, his eyes crinkling up in that endearing way, barely visible in the starlight and Hilde’s flashlight beam that bobbed in front of them along the ground. At least they were here together— even if Hilde had a thousand tools at her disposal, Kircheis’s presence would have been more important than them all.</span>

  <p>
  <span>Watching Hilde and Kircheis leave for Castrop’s planet was one of the worst feelings of Yang’s life. Although he knew that they were both competent, and he couldn’t have stopped Hilde from going on her quest to rescue her father if he had tried, he still looked at her like she was his student, and he had a responsibility to keep her safe. By letting them go, he was abandoning that responsibility. He wished that he had some way of rescuing the count himself— the debt of gratitude that Yang owed him was enormous, and if anything happened to his daughter while following Yang’s plan, he knew the count would not forgive him. But Yang couldn’t think of anything better, at least not anything that Hilde would have accepted. So, he had to let them go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as the shuttle disembarked, Yang ordered his ship to move far back from Castrop’s planet. He didn’t know what the effective range of the Artemis Necklace was, but since it seemed designed to stop a landing invasion, it was probably safe to lurk out in the farther reaches of the system. If most of Castrop’s plan for rebelling hadn’t been based on simply hunkering down and living an agrarian lifestyle— if this had been happening on a planet with much more vigorous trade— it would be an effective tactic to simply blockade the system from outside the Necklace’s reach. Most planets would starve that way— starve of resources, if not food. They dropped some tiny surveillance satellites as they retreated, which would report back on anything that they were too far away to see. He doubted that Castrop would bother shooting them down with the Necklace, at least not until whatever “negotiations” he was having with Hilde ended.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew that there would be no communications with Hilde and Kircheis as soon as they made it to the planet, so he didn’t expect any. Yang remained on the bridge, sitting cross legged at one of the computer stations, just watching the magnified view of Castrop’s planet on the screen, waiting for the shuttle to make its reappearance. The soonest it could come was a couple hours, but Yang wondered if it might take days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had one task to complete while he was waiting, and although it distracted him from the agony of waiting for Hilde and Kircheis to reappear, it was itself a delicate task that he did not expect to enjoy. As he sat on the bridge, Yang wrote out a letter, one that would be sent as soon as he destroyed the Artemis Necklace.</span>
</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Your Majesty Friedrich IV,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Although I remember very clearly the conversation that we had on the day of Count Marbach’s funeral, where I realized that I, being a member of Duke Braunschweig’s staff, no longer could consider myself as having Your Majesty’s favor, I am writing you now asking for special consideration for my actions. I know that this is strange, and even quite impertinent, but if there was ever any small friendship between Your Majesty and this humble servant, please do consider what I have to say.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>By the time that this letter arrives to you on Odin, I will have destroyed the Artemis Necklace surrounding Lord Castrop’s planet. To you, when you have been waiting and holding off on deploying a fleet to deal with this lord as a matter for the crown, this must surely appear like Duke Braunschweig is performing rogue military maneuvers against Your Majesty’s wishes. I know that I do not have your favor any longer, but I beg you to understand that this is not the case, or not completely the case.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I have not destroyed the Artemis Necklace because of any designs that Duke Braunschweig has on Lord Castrop’s land or fortune: his land and fortune are irrelevant. This place, remote as it is, will not be useful as a stepping stone for Duke Braushweig’s political or military feats. And, with the Artemis Necklace destroyed, it has no defenses. It is a remote planet, useless to everyone except the local lord.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>The reason that I have destroyed the Artemis Necklace is a personal one: as you know, Count Mariendorf is Lord Castrop’s prisoner. I have been lucky enough that Count Mariendorf has considered me a friend since my youth, when I was a student at the Imperial Officers Academy. He has been like a father to me, and has supported me for these many years. Because he is now in grave danger, I could not bear to do nothing to assist him. In order to free him, the Necklace must be destroyed. That is all. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I understand that, since I am acting as Duke Braunschweig’s subordinate, this action will be interpreted as a show of strength by the Duke. I apologize to Your Majesty, for disrupting the peace of Odin and the court with this.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>The crown surely wishes to deal with Lord Castrop. I have no intention of stepping in between and enacting my own sense of justice upon him, whatever it may be. My only interest is in Count Mariendorf, who is a loyal servant of the crown. I will defer to him once we have been reunited.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>If there is to be a punishment for deliberately contradicting the crown’s policy in this matter, please let that punishment fall upon myself, rather than upon Duke Braunschweig and any of his other staff, or upon Lady Hildegarde von Mariendorf, who pleaded with me to rescue her father— I would have done this on my own had she not asked. The plan for disobeying Your Majesty and destroying the Artemis Necklace was mine alone, and I have abused Duke Braunschweig’s trust in me to enact it.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Furthermore, if I may continue to strain Your Majesty’s patience, I ask that when the crown takes control of Lord Castrop’s lands, that special care may be taken to improve the living conditions for the people on his planet. Lord Castrop has been a ruler who has not given much thought to the needs of his people, and they lack much of what is required for a happy and secure life: medical services, adequate food, and education for their children. The crown is generous for providing these things to her people on Odin, even to such a man as myself, and, when she takes control of the traitor’s lands, I beg that she provide these things for the people there as well.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Thank you for all the consideration that you have given me, both today and in the past. As always, I wish to remain,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>A humble servant of the Empire’s people,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Captain Hank von Leigh</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
  <span>Letter written, Yang settled in to wait.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The waiting was agonizing, but Yang had a peculiar mental mechanism that allowed him to sit watch anyway, like a meditation or a vigil. There was nothing he could do, so the anxiety was something he held in his heart quietly, rather than a feeling that compelled him to leap around and pace and get in everyone’s way. Castrop’s planet turned, and the line of darkness separating day from night crawled over the main city area. Unlike orbiting Odin or Phezzan, in the darkness, the planet had no lights of its own, just hearth fires not bright enough to show up on satellites. The whole place seemed desolate and uninhabited.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the sun set, the surveillance satellites sent back a message: they were tracking the launch of a shuttle and following it as it came up through the atmosphere. Although the dust cloud which surrounded the planet made radio transmissions difficult, the cameras of the satellites were sharp enough to watch the shuttle’s engine glow— at least on this planet, there were so few light sources that, at night, it stood out like a tiny star. The shuttle made odd, wide circles, either hovered or landed in one spot, then continued circling until it eventually exited the atmosphere.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Hilde and Kircheis’s shuttle. But when Yang tried to raise them on the radio to find out their status, he didn’t get any response. This was odd. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What was odder still was the way that the shuttle moved. As soon as it had exited the atmosphere, but before it entered the rock cloud that surrounded the planet, it did one long burn of its engines, setting it on a strange trajectory, one that would have it half-circle the planet, and then enter the rock cloud without power. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang understood immediately what Kircheis was doing: checking the Artemis Necklace’s ability to discriminate between a shuttle and the rocks that surrounded it. Yang wondered if the Necklace had the ability to fire backwards towards the planet, and targets below where its orbit was. He doubted it, so the shuttle— which he was now sure was unoccupied— was safe until it entered the rock cloud, at the very least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shuttle entered the cloud, and it sat there, even bumping into a small asteroid. Minutes ticked by, with no action from the shuttle or the Necklace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After it had drifted through the rock cloud for a while, the shuttle turned its engine back on, and began to move through the rocks, trying to escape. Yang watched with bated breath. As soon as the engines were on full power and the shuttle was moving, there came a glow from several of the rocks within the cloud, and lines of white fire shot out to vaporize the shuttle instantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Yang knew that Kircheis and Hilde had not been on board, the sight still shocked and froze him for just a moment— the power of the Necklace revealing itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Kircheis’s test had given Yang exactly what he need to know. He had revealed how to bait the Necklace into firing, and how Yang could exploit that to hunt down all its constituent parts and destroy them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang gathered up the staff of the ship who could enact his plan. It was a very simple plan, all told, and it came to him very easily. The Necklace— as Kircheis had realized— had to have some way of tracking targets without constantly firing on the asteroids that surrounded it. Large ships could be targeted visually as they entered the system, but other things— like missiles, which the Necklace would also want to destroy— would be small enough to be confused with rocks, except for their heading and speed and emissions. Shuttles fell into that category. But it meant that anything that looked like a rock, was the size of a rock, and moved unpowered like a rock, might be able to slip through the net.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had his technicians aboard the ship strip out the insides of some of their supply of mines, remove their small heat-tracking engines and replace them with a much simpler electro-mechanical system. The interior of the mines, he left alone. It took a long while to fashion these makeshift bombs, but after two days, Yang had a stack of them at his disposal, and he could put his plan into action.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not expecting any to make it through, Yang ordered the ship to fire missiles at Castrop’s planet. At first, he only used them as bait to determine which objects in orbit were the dangerous Necklace links. He kept up this barrage for a while, turning the sky above Castrop’s planet into a fireworks show, each of the missiles handily destroyed by the Necklace before they could even get close. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To a small selection of missiles, Yang had the technicians attach the modified mines to the missile’s fuel tanks. Since he had removed their normal propulsion, the mines would be carried most of the way by the missiles, and then dropped in a much closer orbit, from which they could begin their independent mission. The mines made it most of the way to Castrop’s planet with their ballistic rides, then detached and floated free in space, looking like debris: spent fuel cells, if anyone happened to be looking closely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the mines, the propulsion system that Yang had substituted was made up of small gas cylinders, which were barely enough to nudge the mines through the debris field. They wove their way towards the links in the Artemis Necklace, moving in tiny little bursts, barely distinguishable from rocks hitting each other and spiraling away. When they each bumped into their target link of the Necklace, they clung to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had no way of being sure that each of the little mines had reached their target. But he waited until they all should have made it, and then a little while longer, and then gave the command that would set off their bombs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At once, they detonated, bombs filled with the highly explosive Zephyr gas. They didn’t knock the Necklace links out of the sky, but they did completely incapacitate them, destroying their focusing mechanisms or power generators and scattering chunks of rock far away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The watching crew of Yang’s ship cheered, especially when they sent one last test missile to scrape the atmosphere of Castrop’s planet, and it made it through unscathed before harmlessly exploding in space.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Yang couldn’t find it in himself to cheer. He didn’t care about Castrop’s Necklace: Count Mariendorf was still a prisoner, and Kircheis and Hilde were still somewhere down on that planet. He tried calling Lord Castrop to urge him to surrender, but his call was met with complete silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole process had taken three days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as Castrop’s ship raised itself out of the atmosphere, like a whale rising from the depths, Yang received a message on the ansible from Castrop’s planet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang answered the call immediately, and the image of Kircheis flickered onto the screen, standing in the clean white marble of Castrop’s home, though in the background, Yang could hear yelling. Kircheis was filthy, with his face streaked with mud, and his uniform torn at the shoulder. He had a haunted expression on his face, and, before he could even speak, the fact that he was alone in the frame made Yang’s heart drop into his stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde is on that ship,” Kircheis said.</span>

  <em>
    <span>October 487 I.C., Planet Castrop</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It took two days to hike from their landing spot back to the city. The journey was exhausting and stressful. They tried to mainly walk at night, to avoid seeing people, and to avoid the heat of the day, since it was quite warm on Castrop’s planet. They hid during the day, sleeping in shifts in the forests away from the road. They stole food from fields as they walked by— it was mainly fruit that they could get their hands on, not quite ripe, or too-ripe and fallen from trees in the orchards they passed. It sufficed, at least, but it gave Hilde terrible indigestion, which didn’t help the walk go faster.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they came closer to the city, kicking up dust along the path (at least it hadn’t rained at all during their long march), they had to be much more careful of being observed. Hilde wondered if they should try to steal outfits like the ones everyone on this planet wore, but they hadn’t passed any farmhouses at night with laundry hung out that they could steal, so the opportunity to change clothes had not presented itself. At least the airfield was on the far outskirts of the city, and, as they approached it at the end of the second night, they were able to hide and crouch in the scraggly bushes that lined the far edge beyond the wire fence. Security was, as it was in most places on Castrop’s planet, minimal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop’s ship still remained exactly where it had been. And, indeed, the whole scene was empty, except for a few bored looking guards at the front of the airfield. Hilde and Kircheis watched their patterns through their tiny pair of binoculars. The guards mainly stood in the single cone of light provided by the lights from the guardhouse, and smoked cigarette after cigarette. Occasionally, one or two of them would make a halfhearted circle of Castrop’s ship, but rarely did they do anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even if Hilde and Kircheis could have snuck up to Castrop’s ship easily, there was no way that they could get on board. There was a chance that within the little guard hut, there was a mechanism to remotely open the ship’s doors, but there was no way to be sure. Even if they did manage to open the ship that way, it would immediately lead to their detection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She and Kircheis discussed this as they sat in their little hideout, a ditch hidden by brambles on the edge of the airfield. Kircheis propped himself up on his elbows and watched the guards through the binoculars.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The only thing that we can do,” Hilde said, “is wait for them to open the ship themselves, and then I can sneak on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>You</span>
  </em>
  <span> can sneak on?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde frowned. “Think about it logically, Sieg. If they’re opening the ship, they’re going to be hanging out right next to it. You’ll need to cause a distraction that will let me on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But why shouldn’t I go, and you cause the distraction?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because if you got caught on the ship, they’d kill you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And not you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m valuable to Castrop,” she said, trying to keep fear out of her voice as she did. “He wouldn’t kill me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis clearly understood the logic, but that didn’t make it any more pleasant. “I’d still rather go myself. Captain Leigh and your father would rather—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t care,” she said. “I appreciate that you want to protect me, but if there’s a greater chance of you dying by doing it, then I’m not going to let you. It’s as simple as that. And I still have Captain Leigh’s program.” She pulled out her data stick and held it up. It glinted dimly in the starlight. Kircheis looked at it, holding himself so tense and still that she was sure he was debating snatching it out of her hands, but he didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t like it,” he said. “How could I live with myself if I let anything happen to you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing will happen,” she said. “You’ll cause a distraction, I’ll run in, install the program, and run out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if you can’t get out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I’ll just have to hide on the ship,” she said. “I can do that. I memorized all the layouts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis nodded. “What kind of distraction would you want?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde gestured for him to hand her the binoculars. With them, she peered out towards the guardhouse. Inside, it had electric lights, and the distant glow of a couple computer screens, visible through the windows. But outside, the light was provided by torches in brackets, which flickered and danced in the wind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy enough to burn something down,” she said. “It’s hot and dry. A fire would probably spread pretty quickly, and it would be something that they needed to respond to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis took the binoculars back. “But we just have to wait until they decide to open the ship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When Castrop decides to leave…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that was the main issue: there had been no sign of Castrop looking to vacate the planet. So the Artemis Necklace must not have been destroyed yet. Hilde had no idea what it would look like from the ground, but Castrop certainly would know as soon as his defenses fell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They waited and hid for another tense, hot day. They were sweltering without the protection of a truly leafy forest around them, and without the ability to leave to drink from springs and streams that they passed on the walk. Hilde hadn’t believed that it would somehow be preferable to be hiking than sitting still, but it was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she was trying to sleep, her head resting on one of the lumpy canvas bags, Kircheis was sitting watch, keeping an eye on the activities of the guards. Suddenly, he shook her awake, and she bolted upright. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” she hissed, not wanting to be too loud in case the reason he had woken her was because they had to move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look at that!” Kircheis said, also in a low voice, and he pointed directly up. The sky was a brilliant crimson, the sun on its way down and the heat of the day finally breaking, but what was truly spectacular was the light show that danced from zenith to horizon in blinding streaks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The display was like fireworks, but silent and far too distant. It was like the dim stars themselves were bursting open. Hilde and Kircheis craned their necks to see it, staring wide eyed at first the beams that shot out across the expanse of space, and then the fiery explosions that followed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh must have figured out the Artemis Necklace,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde hastily started gathering up all of their equipment. “Castrop will be running as soon as he knows it’s over. You go get ready to make a distraction, and I’ll—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good luck,” Kircheis said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You too.” She looked him in the eye. “Don’t stick around and watch for me to come out, if there’s people around. You keep yourself safe. We’ll meet back up by the farm down the road, the one with the pear tree out front. If we get separated.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There wasn’t much time for other discussion. Already the guards, who had been watching the display in the sky, were beginning to move in a chaotic way, clearly untrained for the situation at hand, having never expected it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde gave Kircheis one final grim smile, clasped his hand for just a moment, and then ducked down into their ditch that they had been hiding in, and began her trek around the perimeter of the airfield. She had with her just the few things that might be useful to her: the binoculars, a small pair of wire clippers to let her through the fence, her gun, and the data stick that would destroy Castrop’s ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After some time, Hilde became aware that she was hearing distant sounds of shouting, not coming from the guards but from the city farther away. Hilde couldn’t make out who or why or what the shouting voices were saying. They only seemed to be carried on the wind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the darkness at the edge of the field, she watched the guards perform various duties, but none of them had yet involved opening the great door that would allow entrance to the ship’s loading bay. Some of them were checking the exterior of the ship, while others were swarming around the guardhouse, or opening the gates at the entrance to the airfield.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The source of the shouting became obvious soon enough. From the city, there came a crowd of people, all heading towards the airfield. Most were on foot, but a few were riding horses. Hilde even heard the revving of the motorcycle that she had spotted when she and Kircheis had first been escorted through the city. She understood what was happening: all those who felt that they were in some kind of danger from an Imperial fleet were eager to board the only ship heading off the planet. These must have been mostly lower officials, people who worked directly for Castrop, or perhaps even regular peasants of the planet who feared the unknown more than they feared their lord.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde had a sudden, vivid memory from her childhood— sitting down with Hank, while he described the chaotic evacuation of the planet El Facil, with all the civilians trying their hardest to escape in the face of an oncoming Imperial fleet. At the time, Hilde had been young enough that she hadn’t really understood what that would have looked like on the ground, and she had only been thinking of the cold movements of ships through space. Now she was old enough to recognize this terror and desperation for what it was. She wished that she could tell these people that there was no reason to be afraid: Captain Leigh in the sky above them bore them no ill will whatsoever. But of course, they had no way of knowing that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Visible above the top of the crowd, there came Castrop’s entourage, or the first part of it. There were small trucks, military surplus from the looks of it, that pushed through the crowd, attempting to scatter the crowd as the trucks rolled up to the airfield gates, trying to get through. These must have been some of Castrop’s supplies, or select group of people who were chosen to accompany him. Hilde couldn’t tell if Castrop himself was among their number— maybe, maybe not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they came through the gates, all of the guards who had been assigned to the airfield were occupied in keeping the general population out. The trucks pulled up to the ship, and the ramp began to slowly descend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde watched this with increasing fear, waiting for Kircheis to make his move, whatever that move would be. Although the ramp was coming down, the guards and whoever else were in the trucks were still right there, and would prevent Hilde from being able to enter the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Sieg,” she whispered under her breath, every muscle in her body taught as she prepared to leap from her hiding place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cutting through the sounds of the crowd and the roar of the truck engines, Hilde heard the clear and unmistakable whine of a shot being fired. Things seemed to move in slow motion: down at the entrance to the airfield, one of the guards who had been holding back the tide collapsed. Then there was another shot, impossible to determine the direction from which it had come, and another guard collapsed, and another. This gave the crowd enough room and courage to burst through in one wave. The guards that remained opened fire on the crowd, but they were quickly overwhelmed by sheer numbers, and vanished under the wave of the stampede.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This had the intended effect: the guards who had begun unloading the trucks immediately had to abandon this task. If Hilde had been one of them, she would have run up into the ship and tried to close the door to stop people from getting in, but these guards were not well trained, and instead they also tried to take up defensive positions at the trucks. They shot randomly into the crowd with their sidearms, but they, too, were immediately overwhelmed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some of the crowd started tearing open the boxes of supplies on the trucks, while others began to swarm up into the ship. Hilde knew that this would be her only chance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From down the airstrip, she heard the sound of more engines coming, this time not stopping at the gates. This was probably a better trained contingent of the guard, possibly Castrop’s personal vehicles. There was the sound of machine gun fire.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde abandoned her hiding place and made the mad dash across the airfield, covering the short distance to Castrop’s ship faster than she would have thought possible. She was barely even cognizant of her own body; the distance melted away before her.The crowd ignored her, even though she was dressed oddly. Her feet pounded up the metal ramp, and her body was shoved side to side, surrounded by the crush of others attempting to enter the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde pushed through the screaming, urgent crowd. They had broken into the main section of the ship from the loading bay, and she found herself in strange hallways, a ship so different from the normal Imperial designs. Here, even the sounds of the crowd behind her as she ran were muffled. The floor was tiled with mosaics, and the walls were covered in drapes that ate the sound from the air. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Having memorized the layout of the generic type of ship she was on, she had at least an idea of where she needed to go, towards any place that would have computer terminals that controlled the ship. She felt the engine room was likely to be emptier than the bridge, so she tried to make her way in that direction. But as she ran, she realized that extensive modifications had been made to the ship in its layout, and hallways ended randomly, or twisted unexpectedly. She wasted precious minutes trying to get her bearings. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time she had made it to the engine room, she could no longer hear the crowd in the ship. She felt completely alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The engine room was locked, as she had expected that it would be, but Leigh had told her the generic passcode that was installed on ships of this class, and she tried it. It did not surprise her that Castrop, for all his aesthetic work on the ship, had never bothered to update the passcodes for the doors. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The engine room was dark, and cavernous, and for the moment, silent: the engine was turned off while the ship was still sitting quiescent on the airfield. Her footsteps clanged over the diamond pattern metal floor panels, and she located one of the first maintenance computers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hit a few keys to wake it up, and before it even presented the login screen, she jammed the data stick into its port. The program that Leigh had given her was one that needed nothing other than bare access to the computer, and she could see it begin to work, the screen flashing black and a single loading bar crawling across it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She alternated her attention between the computer and the door of the engine room, listening for any sounds of footsteps. The yelling of the crowd was coming closer again, she caught distant strains of it as it echoed through the ventilation shafts and corridors. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took three minutes for the program to install itself, and when the loading bar flashed green and the screen cleared to show the harmless login, Hilde ripped out the data stick and turned back the way she had come. She needed to get out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This, however, proved to be impossible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she moved back towards the front of the ship, she tried to avoid being seen. Now, mixed amid the chaotic yells of the crowd rejoicing in getting aboard, there were the sounds of gunshots, and terrified screams. The passage back seemed blocked, and she might just have to find a place to hide on board the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As carefully as she could, she crept through the hallways, turning whenever she heard voices or footsteps or any other sound. As she went, she felt herself losing track of her position in the ship relative to the drawings she had memorized earlier. Her anxiety mounted and she moved faster, not even sure if she was looking for the way out or a place to hide. She should have stayed in the engine room, which would not have much traffic passing through it, but it was too late now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she went, she felt a sensation that made her blood run cold: the strange twist in her gut that was the gravity engine at the center of the ship waking up, and beginning to lift them off the planet. At this point, she knew, there would be no escaping the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The best place to be was the emergency shuttles, she realized. Ideally, Lord Castrop would not know that she was on board his ship, and when time came to evacuate onto the shuttles, she would still be safe. She turned in the direction she thought they were, but then realized that there were footsteps behind her. She hastened her pace, and ended up in another narrow corridor where she could hear voices in front of her, as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde looked back and forth, frozen, pulling back the drapes from the walls to see if there was somewhere she could slip into, but there wasn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The footsteps and the voices came closer and closer, and the footsteps turned towards her. Hilde whirled on her heel and found herself face to face with guards with raised guns. They pointed their weapons at her. An involuntary yelp of terror left her mouth. “Please—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guards, although it didn’t stop them from aiming their guns, seemed momentarily surprised by her appearance. She didn’t look like the rest of the crowd who had broken into the ship: she was something completely different. It made them hesitate before shooting, and this was what saved her from becoming a victim of the guards, who had all been ordered to hunt down intruders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From the other end of the corridor, the voices she had been hearing turned into running feet, and two women, dressed in Castrop’s preferred fashion, appeared. Hilde recognized them as some of the dancers that Castrop had made perform at dinner. They recognized her as well, blanching like they had seen a ghost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What—” one of the dancers said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rudy! Put that gun down!” the other commanded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of the two guards, Rudy, did lower his weapon. The dancers glanced up and down the hallway, checking to see if anyone else was around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You too, David,” the first dancer said. She had red hair, and long, dangling earrings. David, the second guard, was more wary, but also lowered his gun. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The situation had immediately deflated into something still dangerous, but less outright fatal to Hilde, and she recognized that the dancers were her allies here, or at least people she could get some sympathy from. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the hell are you doing here?” the black haired dancer asked. “We had all assumed you were dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—” Hilde began, and she realized that she was going to have to change her posture. If she wanted sympathy, she couldn’t be someone who had broken onto the ship to destroy it— she had to be more pathetic than that. “I wanted to find my father,” she said, and the choked sound in her voice, even if she had let it come out on purpose, was all too real.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know this person?” Rudy asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s that count’s daughter,” the black haired dancer said. “Did you not see her the other day?” It galled to feel like it was only her noble status and usefulness to Castrop that was about to keep her alive, as opposed to the hapless peasants who were being gunned down in the corridors, but that was the reason she had gone on the ship in the first place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t recognize people,” Rudy muttered, but he looked at Hilde with fresh eyes. “I did hear that you were dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde just shook her head, not going to explain anything, pretending to be too choked up and overwhelmed. The dancers and guards looked at each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How old are you, girl?” the redhead asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sixteen,” Hilde lied. That was probably the youngest she could get away with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The redheaded dancer looked up and down the hallway again. “What the fuck are we going to do with you?” she muttered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guard David, said, “Give her to the lord, obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely not,” the black haired dancer said. “He— I can’t have that on my head.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what?” Rudy asked. “You gonna put her in your room?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This proposition made both dancers wince. “No,” the black haired one said. “Look— David—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this” —he gestured at Hilde— “really what you want to fight with the lord over?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she hissed. “I don’t want anything to do with this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The redhead spoke up. “Give her what she wants,” she said. “Put her in the cell with that count. Lord Castrop doesn’t need to know the details right now. And if he finds out— maybe he’ll think someone told him she was there while he was drunk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s the stupidest fucking thing I’ve ever heard,” Rudy said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde stood there and listened to this argument, wide-eyed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, if we do that, none of us can get in trouble for it— it’s what Lord Castrop wanted in the first place,” the redhead hissed. “And it won’t be my problem anymore. At least there will be time to think about what to actually do with her. Unless you have a better idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t have to be anyone’s problem,” David said, and waved his gun. The black haired dancer shoved past Hilde and whacked his arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde decided the situation was getting out of hand. She didn’t love the idea of being imprisoned with her father, but she couldn’t very well tell the four to hide her somewhere else and let her wander— she wasn’t in any position to be making demands. “Please can I see my father?” she said, letting her voice stay pathetic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“See,” the redhead said. “It’s better for everyone. As long as one of you brings the food there and whatever else—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You really want to put this on us, hunh?” Rudy said. “You’re asking for a lot. You’ll owe me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever,” the redhead said. “You’re going to have to deal with this one way or another. It’s your problem. You figure something out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, fine,” Rudy said. He glanced up and down the hallway now, and grabbed Hilde’s arm. She stayed loose and floppy as he tugged her along, heading somewhere into the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dancers walked ahead, and the other guard, David, took a lookout behind, making sure that no one was coming up behind them as they walked. If someone had come, Hilde didn’t know what they would do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they went, Hilde flinched as she saw a few bodies of other people who had broken onto the ship, lying shot dead on the floor, blood seeping through the grout cracks in the tiles. She knew it wouldn’t help her to feel guilty for surviving this where these people hadn’t, but she couldn’t help it. The faces of the dead were agonized, or terrified, or surprised, and their open eyes followed her in her imagination as she walked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Guilt could become resolve. That was what she needed right now. If what she was doing right now could play a part in never again letting Castrop have power over people like this, then she would do it. It wouldn’t make a difference to the dead, but it would make a difference to someone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sight of these bodies hastened the guards and dancers along, none of them wanting to look at them too closely. This distraction let Hilde quickly divest herself of the various incriminating objects she was carrying while no one was looking, dropping her gun and data stick into the spread arms of a few corpses they passed. She wished that she could have kept the gun, but she figured if she was going to be searched at any point, it would be better for her not to have it on her person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room where her father was being kept was in an innocuous hallway, hidden behind a curtain. David pulled it open, unlocked the door, and shoved Hilde inside. Realizing that they weren’t going to bother to search her, she wished she had kept the gun. This was the stupid thought her brain fixated on as she fell to the floor, and the door shut behind her, leaving her in total darkness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father had not said anything, and probably hadn’t had a chance to even see her face in the light. She glimpsed him sitting on the floor in the corner before they shut the door, looking haggard but not visibly wounded. She crawled over towards him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s me,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde?” His voice broke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.”  His hand fumbled for her, and found her arm. She leaned on him. “We’ll be out of here soon,” she said. “Hank’s plan is going alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father was silent, except for his choked breathing. He could tell that the confidence in her voice was false. She was so grateful to him for not deciding to yell at her for being here. It was too late for telling her to stay safe to make any difference, and so chastizing her about it only would have served to make both of them feel worse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she could feel his arm trembling against her; he was shaking with the kind of misery that couldn’t be put into words. Again, the growing combination of guilt and resolve that this made her feel churned her stomach. Maybe it wasn’t that he chose not to yell at her— maybe he couldn’t form the words, being overwhelmed by the idea of her as Castrop’s captive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really, Dad,” she said, and she sounded more reassuring now, knowing that she had to be stronger. “Everything’s in place. As long as we can hold out for a few days…”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>After they both slept, it was much easier to talk to her father about the plan, and convince him that it really was going to be alright, that Hilde had not doomed herself by coming to rescue him. As her father grew more confident in Leigh’s plan (though never fully), Hilde grew less, but she didn’t let that into her voice. As long as she and her father were both able to act rationally, they would be fine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was miserable, being trapped in the dark there with him, but it was better than being alone. The passage of time was difficult to discern, only knowable through the intermittent delivery of meals and the changing of the chemical toilet. The guards who delivered their meals were always Rudy and David. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For their efforts in keeping her safe, she wanted to warn them about the ship’s impending doom, to make sure that they and the dancers got a spot on the shuttle when the ship was to be evacuated, but if she had done that, the whole plan might have been revealed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since no one other than Rudy and David knew that there were two prisoners, only one meal was ever brought for both of them to eat. She and her father split it as evenly as they could, but she was sure that each of them were subtly trying to give the other the better half of their bread and cheese and water. The food and water were meager for even one, and her father had been subsisting on this diet since he had arrived on Castrop’s planet, so he was suffering more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It must have been days that they were trapped in their little cell. As time passed, Hilde wondered when Leigh’s program would activate, and what would happen when it did. The stress mounted, but with no signal from the outside world, it was hard to feel like she could do anything about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish there was a way for me to tell Hank that I was able to activate his program,” Hilde said. “Maybe he thinks that I didn’t get the chance. Or maybe he hasn’t told Castrop yet because he thinks he wouldn’t be believed— that it’s a bluff.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. I trust Leigh.” This was a sentiment that her father repeated, clinging to it. She clung to it, as well. It was about the only thing that they had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without an easy way to track time, Hilde had no idea of how long it was taking them to get to the other side of the galaxy, or what would happen to them if they arrived there before Leigh’s plan went into action. Possibly, Leigh had changed his mind about the plan, and would try to get his spy on Phezzan to save them. That was a long shot— they probably wouldn’t even land on the planet, just pass through that corridor. Leigh’s battleship wouldn’t be able to follow them. Without pursuers, her father would lose value as a hostage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some time into their captivity, there were loud voices outside the door of their cell. Hilde recognized them, muffled though they were: it was Rudy, the guard, and Lord Castrop. Hilde shook her father awake and whispered to him. “What’s Lord Castrop doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rudy’s voice grew louder, and he was taking a long time to unlock the door. He must intentionally be giving her time to compose herself, or trying to find a way to get Castrop to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s probably asleep, my lord. It’s not usually the time I feed him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, wake him up,” Castrop said. “We’re getting close to Phezzan. I think it’s right for me to say my goodbyes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s going to kill—” Hilde whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You need to get out of here,” her father whispered back, and he stood. Hilde stood as well. “When that door opens, you run. Find some place to hide or get in the shuttle, whatever you need to do, Hilde.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door swung open, blinding light spilling in on both of them. As it did, her father leaped at Lord Castrop, swinging his fist. Castrop reeled backwards, stunned, and it gave Hilde the tiniest window to slip out between them, run past the startled Rudy, and scramble down the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes were watering with pain in the bright hallway lights, and her legs were unused to so much movement after having sat on a floor for days, but she ran, stumbling over her own dress. She wasn’t sure where she was in the ship, but she knew that the shuttle was in the lower area, and so every time she had an opportunity to descend a set of stairs, she took it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she ran through the hallways, she flew past startled men and women, no one expecting her to run by them. This gave her some time, the element of surprise working in her favor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She even made it to the shuttle, in the unlocked bay where it sat. It was shiny and clean, alone on an empty floor, one of the few areas of the ship untouched by Castrop’s decorations. But the shuttle itself was locked, and none of the combinations she tried punching into the number pad could open the door. She stood there, pulling at it uselessly, and she could hear footsteps pounding down the halls now, coming after her. She wanted to barricade the door of the shuttle bay, but there was no way for her to lock it from where she was, and even if she had locked it, that would have just enabled someone to open the other, rear doors, and pull all the air out of the room to kill her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, as the footsteps came closer, she straightened, and although she was filthy and unkempt, tried to appear as imposing as she could. Or at least as uncowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guards were the first to enter the bay, and they aimed their guns at her, but didn’t shoot. Among them was David, and Hilde didn’t meet his eyes. He had a blank expression on his face, and there was no point in her getting him in trouble, or in more trouble than he was going to be in already.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Castrop took a minute longer to appear. His normally so smooth hair was ruffled, and his bare arm had a long, clawed scratch down it, visibly bloody. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You and your father never cease to amuse me, Lady Mariendorf,” he said, his voice cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde stayed silent. There was absolutely nothing she could say that would help her, so it was safer to say nothing at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My guards did say they found you breaking into my ship and took care of you. I suppose I made a wrong assumption about what that had entailed. I should have asked to see the body. That’s twice now I’ve assumed you were dead. If there comes to be a third time, I suppose I will have learned my lesson.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop waited for her to say something, but she simply stood there and stared at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here, trying to get into a shuttle?” he asked. “You came all this way for your father, and you’d just leave him behind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He told me to go,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you’re such an obedient daughter of his. What a wonderful quality.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he alive?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s useful until we get past Phezzan, which shouldn’t be long. After that, of course, he won’t be useful anymore.” Castrop looked at her. “But you might be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you want to know what I’ll use you for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How was my Artemis Necklace destroyed?” Castrop asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think you still won’t know if you’re asked </span>
  <em>
    <span>very </span>
  </em>
  <span>nicely?” Castrop asked. “The rebel territories— you know, they have their own Necklace around their capital planet. I think they will very much want to know what its weaknesses are. You’ll be valuable to me, in telling them. I don’t know what methods they’ll use to get it out of you, but I’m happy to let them try.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have anything to say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll see about that,” Castrop said, with a very smug expression. He turned away. “Take her away. Make sure she can’t escape this time. I don’t need any more fuss.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This ship is rigged to explode,” Hilde said as the guards came towards her. “You need to evacuate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Castrop smiled thinly. “I doubt it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guards stepped up and surrounded her, dragging her away. This time, she struggled against them, but this didn’t earn her anything other than bruises where their hands crushed her arms to keep her still. They went all the way to the top of the ship, to a place that Hilde had not been before, and where the decor was much richer, even for the standards of this already gaudy vessel. When the guards opened the last door, leading into some sort of living suite, she realized that she had been brought to Castrop’s private quarters. She struggled against her captors, but no matter how she kicked, she couldn’t get free.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The suite was comprised of a bedroom and a living room. The living room had a water fixture on the wall, a fountain that rushed down in a small, tame waterfall, and one of the guards plunged his hand through the water and pressed a secret button, so that the whole wall opened like a door, revealing another small room. They tied Hilde’s arms behind her back, attached the tie to a clasp on the wall, stuffed a gag of fabric in her mouth, and slammed the door shut. Her ties were far too tight, and they bruised her arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laying there in the dark, she couldn’t get her heartrate down or her breathing under control. She couldn’t decide if it was herself or her father she was afraid for. How far away were they from Phezzan? She wondered if there would be any chance for her to escape this. If they did make it past Phezzan, she would try to kill Castrop herself. Even if the ship was going to explode, she’d do it with her own hands if he came in here. She ran through whatever scenarios her mind could come up with— none of them were pleasant, but it was the only thing she could think about. That, and her father, but it was better— easier— less painful— to think about herself. She struggled to undo the ties binding her hands, but this only seemed to make them tighter, and they bit into her skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Time passed strangely, made worse by constantly expecting Castrop to reappear. Perhaps he was busy enough that he couldn’t spare time for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was so much worse to be a prisoner alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After what felt like, or maybe was, hours, Hilde heard noises outside. These noises didn’t sound like Castrop at all. In fact, the voices she heard, past the burbling of the water fixture, didn’t even sound like they were speaking the Imperial language. Had they bypassed Phezzan and made it into the rebel territories directly? This thought elated her and terrified her— if they were in the rebel territories, her father was probably dead. But whoever these rebels were might be more sympathetic to her than Castrop. She would rather be a prisoner of war than a prisoner of Castrop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde tried to yell, but the gag muffled any sound she made. She yanked even harder at her restraints, trying to inch her way forward so that she could kick the door to signal her presence. The wall was just out of reach of her foot, no matter how she twisted her arms behind her back to give herself the maximum distance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The voices faded away, and she almost cried. But she kept her wits about her, and she listened very closely, hoping that they would come back. Time passed, and still she strained against her bonds. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde almost gave up hope that someone else friendly, or at least not Lord Castrop, would come and find her. But then, very faint, she heard her father’s voice, calling her name. If she had been a less realistic person, she might have thought it was the voice of a ghost. But she had never been prone to that kind of flight of fancy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde!” her father cried. “Hilde!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Desperate, Hilde tried to make any noise, but it was muffled by the gag. She did the only thing that she could think of, which was to slip her feet out of her shoes, and blindly fumble for the edge of her shoe with her toe. She almost lost it, letting it slip away out of her reach, but she found it again. She was able to pick up her shoe with her feet, and whack it against the door— it gave her just a few extra inches of reach, which was all that she needed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you hear that?” her father asked. He was speaking in the language of the rebel territories— which he wasn’t very good at.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” said someone else in that same language.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fraulein Mariendorf! Where are you?” yelled the other voice, switching to the Imperial language.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She renewed her whacking on the door with her shoe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The door opener! Give it to me!” the other voice said, now back in the rebel language.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a fumbling, knocking sound at the door, and then the seal broke open, and water splashed into the room, along with a blinding light. Hilde dropped her shoe and squinted at her rescuer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a young man in the doorway, wearing a rebel fleet uniform. He was, quite possibly, the most beautiful man Hilde had ever seen, but that might have just been the impression she got from the way the light haloed his braided blond hair, and the fact that he was saving her. Her father shoved past him and crouched down on the floor, untying her gag. He didn’t say anything, just looked at her with an almost unbearable love and concern.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are we in the Alliance?” Hilde asked, speaking in the rebel language. The relief she felt made it so easy to ask practical questions, and she hoped that her father would understand that this meant she was fine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phezzan,” her father and the rebel fleet soldier said simultaneously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soldier came over to her and inspected the ties binding her hands. They were thick wire ropes, so, rather than trying to cut through them, the soldier pulled out a pocket knife and pried the crimps apart to let her free. She sat up and rubbed some circulation back into her hands— of all the parts of her, they had fared the worst. The skin on her wrists was ripped open from her trying to escape, and her hands were swollen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Mr…?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lieutenant Commander Reinhard von Müsel,” the soldier said. “Can you stand up?” he switched into the Imperial language— from his name and how fluent he sounded, she was sure he must have been an Imperial expat of some sort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She struggled to her feet, supporting herself on her father. “Oh, I’m dizzy,” she said, but then she realized, in the light, that her father looked quite haggard. “Are you alright?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I’m fine now. Are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Been better.” But it was delivered cheerfully, as much as the situation would allow, and she smiled at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Müsel, who had been listening to this exchange, said, “I’m sorry to rush you, but we really do need to get off this ship as soon as possible. Can you walk?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me put my shoes back on,” she said, and did her best to slip them back onto her feet, struggling with her dress as she did. “Gods, I hate this stupid dress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as she had her shoes on, Müsel hustled them out of Castrop’s suite, and down the hallways of the ship. There was evidence that the ship had been searched: many of the drapes that lined the walls were pulled back, revealing hidden closets, and probably the place where her father had been held.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they walked out towards the entrance of the ship, they passed various members of Castrop’s entourage, all filing back in. They must have emptied out for the rebel fleet soldiers to search it. They watched Müsel leave with her and her father with strange expressions. Hilde stared straight ahead, keeping her mouth firmly shut. Perhaps she should have tried harder to warn them all about the damage that she had done to the ship, but she didn’t. It seemed like her last chance to take revenge on Castop, for both her own sake, and for the sake of all the people he had ordered killed. If she had uttered this train of thought aloud to anyone, especially Leigh, she knew she would feel guilty. But she wasn’t going to say a word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally reached the exit of the ship, and stumbled out into the overwhelm of the busy Phezzani spaceport, Müsel waved over a few other rebel fleet soldiers. To them, he said, “Take the Mariendofs down to the High Commissioner’s Office. Get them any medical treatment that they need, and clean clothes, and lodgings for at least the night. I need to stay here in case I need to deal with Castrop himself, but I’ll want to talk to them later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father, who knew enough of the rebel language to understand the conversation, said, “Am I your prisoner now, Lieutenant Commander?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir. This is Phezzan. I have no authority to take prisoners.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been finding that authority to take prisoners is not something that is really necessary. Force will suffice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dad, we can cooperate.” At the very least, staying on the good side of these soldiers was the safe thing to do for the moment. On Phezzan, if they were treated badly, the Imperial embassy would certainly find out and have some way of dealing with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, alright,” her father said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Müsel replied. The soldiers escorted Hilde and her father away, and her father kept her close, pulling her to his side and putting his arm around her shoulder. She didn’t mind that at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were brought down the long space elevator to the surface of Phezzan, and, as Müsel had said, were taken care of. Hilde was able to shower, for the first time in many days. A doctor looked at her wrists and wrapped them in bandages with ointment. Someone asked what size clothes she wore, and she told them to get her a pair of pants, please. She felt like a human again, when she finally got to sit down and eat something, some takeout food that a soldier procured. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were stuck in the Alliance’s offices, sat in a conference room with huge plate glass windows. Occasionally, soldiers walked by and looked at them curiously, but no one was hostile to them, and hardly anybody bothered them. The man in charge of the whole operation, a commodore by the name of Blackwell, stopped in briefly and asked them about what they had been doing on Castrop’s ship. Her father answered in generalities, describing his trip to the planet, to negotiate with Castrop, and how that had gone wrong. The commodore didn’t seem enthused about this answer, but didn’t press further, and instead left after a few minutes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He reappeared later, outside the door, with Müsel. Hilde couldn’t hear the conversation he had with the lieutenant commander, but both parties could see each other. A mutual observation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Müsel came in, which made both Hilde and her father stand. He waved at the table and took a seat across from them. They both sat back down, wary but not too afraid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Castrop left for Heinessen,” he said. “How’s your dinner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good, thank you,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate the Alliance’s hospitality very much,” her father said. He spoke in Imperial, but he dipped into the rebel language to name their country, which made Hilde smile, though she hid it behind her cup of water. Müsel smiled, too. Her father was diplomatic as always.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you’re on Phezzan,” Müsel said. “It’s in everyone’s best interest to be hospitable around here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will we be allowed to leave?” her father asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume you have no desire to immigrate to the Alliance. You’re welcome to, of course, or you can stay on Phezzan and do as you please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t believe that would be in anyone’s best interest. I’m very grateful that I will have the opportunity to return to my own life, with my daughter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Müsel pulled a pad of paper from the center of the table, and wrote something down on it, before passing it to her father. “When you walk out of here, go see Lieutenant Commander Neidhart Muller, over in the Imperial Embassy. He’ll make sure you get where you need to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know him?” she asked. It seemed very odd that a man whose nation was at war with hers would be friendly enough with the enemy to have a personal recommendation of who to speak to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phezzan is a very small planet. It’s inevitable that you cross paths with your counterpart on the other side, on occasion. He has a reputation for being dependable, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” her father said. “May I ask a question?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You said that you knew Captain Leigh. Could you explain how?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know Hank?” Hilde asked. Was this Leigh’s spy on Phezzan? Her heart leaped— Leigh must have sent him personally to rescue her and her father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a strong word for it,” Müsel said. “I fled the Empire when I was ten, with my mother and sister. My next door neighbor, when I was a child, was one of Captain Leigh’s students.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know that? Which student?” Hilde was leaning forward over the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Müsel raised an eyebrow, so her father explained, “My daughter weasled her way into attending some of Captain Leigh’s classes when he taught at the Imperial Officers Academy. She might have been his classmate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Müsel smiled. “Were you following the news of— not this most recent February, but the one before that— when Rear Admiral Reuenthal attacked Condor Base?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I know about that,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe Imperial papers carried the full story. Rear Admiral Reuenthal took the base staff prisoner. I was stationed there at the time, and, with a friend of mine, Lieutenant Commander Greenhill, we were able to commandeer a ship and rescue the prisoners. During that process, I overheard a conversation between Rear Admiral Reuenthal and Captain Leigh, talking about his students. That’s how I knew of Captain Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oskar never told me about that,” Hilde said, glancing at her father and leaning back in her chair. “I’ll have to beg him for details, next time I see him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure the rear admiral does not want to regale you with that story,” her father said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He won the engagement,” Müsel pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, but who is the student of Hank’s that you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Müsel put his hand on his chest. “Siegfried Kircheis. Do you know him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde laughed aloud. “Oh, gods, yes, I know him. He’s my closest friend. He was just—” Her happiness was cut off when she realized that she had no idea what had happened to Kircheis after she left Castrop’s planet. She had been assuming that he was fine, but she had no way of knowing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Small universe,” her father said. “Sub-Lieutenant Kircheis is a good man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please give him my fondest regards.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will, I promise,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you doing on Castrop’s planet, if I may ask?” He looked at her, specifically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There was the idea that I might be able to negotiate for my father’s release. Obviously, it failed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how did you end up being taken prisoner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew Castrop was going to use my father as a bargaining chip for as long as he could. So, I was attempting to free him, and I ended up trapped as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see. And what caused Castrop to leave his planet?” This was a very pointed question, and her father deliberately stepped in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. Neither of us were in much of a position to observe what was going on, when we finally ended up on his ship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Müsel’s eyes narrowed, but he nodded. “Castrop said that the Artemis Necklace that was protecting his planet— the same one that protects Heinessen— was destroyed, and that caused him to flee. Do you know anything about that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If anyone could do something like that, it would be Hank,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you don’t know how he did it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” her father said confidently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I lost contact with him before everything happened. I don’t know what he did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Müsel said. “I appreciate your honesty.” He stood, and Hilde and her father did as well. Müsel offered his hand to her father, and then her, shaking their hands. “If you need anything else while on Phezzan, don’t hesitate to contact me, or anyone else at the High Commissioner’s Office.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” her father said. “I owe you a great debt, for myself, and for my daughter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about it,” Müsel said with a smile. “I have developed something of a reputation for freeing captives, it seems.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde laughed. “It was a pleasure to meet you, Lieutenant Commander. I wish I could get to know you better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This war won’t last forever, Fraulein Mariendorf. When it ends, perhaps we can be friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like that very much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She and her father were let out of the Alliance’s offices, and onto the bustling streets of Phezzan. It was so different from Castrop’s planet and Odin that Hilde had difficulty taking it in for a minute, just standing on the street corner and listening to all the noise. People rushed by hither and thither, and neon lights buzzed from every window, and cars had to fight with pedestrians for passage on the streets. The buildings rose up so high at points that the thick evening clouds surrounded them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should we go directly to the embassy?” Hilde asked her father after she had taken stock of her senses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father nodded silently, and pointed down the street, beginning to walk. He had been to Phezzan before, for business and pleasure, and so was familiar with it where Hilde was not. He seemed morose, or at least lost in thought, despite the fact that they were free.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is something the matter?” she said after a few minutes of walking, dodging in between other pedestrians. “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a moment for her father to answer. “I won’t question your decision,” he said, “but you didn’t tell the rebels that you sabotaged Lord Castrop’s ship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She lifted her chin, looking up in the black sky above. “No, I didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll tell Lieutenant Commander Muller, in the Imperial Embassy,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know that he won’t do anything with that information.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked over at her. “Did Castrop hurt you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she said. She wasn’t sure if her father believed her, but she was telling the truth. “I was very lucky, or there just wasn’t time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a moment, her father said, “Captain Leigh would not want those people to die for no reason.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll tell Lieutenant Commander Muller,” she said again. “If he doesn’t do anything with it, then it’s the crown’s decision.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One that you’ll have to live with.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was going to kill you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to turn around and go tell the rebel fleet to pull Castrop off his ship?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” he said. “If I really wanted that, I would also do it myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded. There was a part of her that had been convinced to change her mind, but she stopped herself. The guilt was heavy in her stomach, but she tried to twist that feeling into resolve. </span>

  <em>
    <span>October 487 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s journey back to Odin would have been a lot worse if he hadn’t gotten the chance to speak with Hilde and Count Mariendorf on the ansible, once they were safe on Phezzan. He and Kircheis breathed a mutual sigh of relief to see them both safe and as well as could be expected. Yang apologized deeply for not freeing Hilde and the count from Lord Castrop’s ship earlier. Although Yang had chased his ship as far as he could, right until the entrance to the Phezzan corridor, and had tried to tell Castrop about the sabotage on his vessel to get him to abandon it, Castrop had paid no attention to his bluff— though it was in no way a bluff.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, although the prevailing feeling was relief— everyone he cared about had gotten out safely— a cloud of worry and guilt hung over Yang on his way back home. It wasn’t just the fact that he worried his relationship with Count Mariendorf might be permanently strained. He felt bad for the news he had received from Muller on Phezzan, that Castrop was dead. This seemed like Yang’s fault, and a pointless loss of life. He had warned Muller about the sabotage, but, of course, Muller had his own duties, which involved stopping Castrop, now a traitor, from fleeing to the Alliance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang also wasn’t sure what to expect upon his arrival back home— his letter to the Kaiser had surely been received, but Yang had heard nothing in response, which seemed like a worrying sign. At the very least, if he was going to be arrested for going against the Kaiser’s will, it seemed like it would happen on the ground. No warship had been dispatched to shoot him down, though he made his route quite public, following all the usual rules about the movements of military ships within the Empire, which would have made him very easy to hunt down en route.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But when he arrived back at Odin, he settled his ship back into Braunschweig’s fleet hangars without incident. And when Yang stepped out of the spaceport and into the chill October air, there were no police waiting for him, or any other kind of trouble. No trouble, except for Magdalena, who met him at the doors, sitting alone in her convertible right outside. Although it was well into autumn, she had the roof down— she liked the feeling of wind in her hair more than she hated the cold, and she was dressed in a sleek fur coat to compensate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If it isn’t the talk of the town!” she called, to get his attention, not like she needed to do anything to capture his attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis, who had followed Yang out, beat a swift retreat back into the spaceport, and Yang watched him go dolefully, then climbed into Magdalena’s car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could have given a ride to your little lackey,” she said, looking affronted. “Does Herr Kircheis not trust my driving skills?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think he just wanted to give us space,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aww.” Magdalena revved her car and pulled out into the street. “He’s such a considerate young man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t realize you were going to meet me here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what kind of a fiancee would I be if I didn’t?” she asked. “It’s not like I have much else going on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?” Yang asked, and Magdalena just laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Usually, I’d say it’s boring around here without you, but you have this unique talent of making things interesting even when you’re half the galaxy away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To be honest, I expected to be met at the spaceport by MPs coming to arrest me,” Yang said. “If that’s the kind of ‘interesting’ that you’re talking about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure it’s one and the same.” Even though she was driving, whipping around corners a little too quickly, Magdalena reached across the car to fish in her purse for something. It was heavy envelope, which she handed to Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s this?” he asked, though he could tell from the seal exactly who the letter was from.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Kaiser wants an audience with you,” she said. “That’s your invite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know what for?” The letter in his hands felt like a live bomb, and he pried it open but didn’t look at it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a clue,” Magdalena said. “But since I thought you were out of His Majesty’s good graces, I’m pleased that you’ve somehow found your way back into them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how I could have. Did Princess Amarie say something to him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. It’s possible. I like the princess, but I’m not exactly her bosom friend, however much I’d like to be. So I’m not aware of all her activities.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She probably would have told you if she was intervening on my behalf.” Yang sighed and looked out at the road. “I just want things to be simple, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They never will be. What does the letter say?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang finally looked at it, reading it slowly. “It’s a formal audience, in front of the whole court. Next week.” He laughed bitterly. “I could really do without that. Before, when the Kaiser wanted to speak to me, it was always private. Nobody in the court likes me, so there’s no reason for him to show me off in front of them if he’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>happy</span>
  </em>
  <span> with me. He probably wants to make a point about Braunschweig stepping out of line…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The possibilities tumbled around in his head, and most of them were pretty unpleasant. The fact that it was an invitation made him think he wasn’t in any personal danger, but he was sure it was about to be a political mess. He flipped the thick card over in his hands— this probably hadn’t actually come from the Kaiser, but from Marquis Lichetenlade, the prime minister. Yang could practically feel the political chastizing that he and Duke Braunschweig were about to be subjected to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dress nicely,” Magdalena said. “That’s my advice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll wear my dress uniform.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Has anything else been happening while I’ve been gone?” Yang asked, struggling to change the subject. Magdalena was only too happy to comply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been working very hard on planning our wedding,” she said. “I made some selections for the menu and the decorations. I’m sure you’ll love them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have excellent taste, Maggie— I don’t think I’ll have any criticisms.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed at him for that. “You wouldn’t know good taste if it bit you. But I’ll be grateful that you’re correctly choosing not to question my choices.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I in any danger of getting bitten by good taste?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luckily, they were at a stop light, so when Magdalena leaned over to nip at Yang’s earlobe, she didn’t send the car swerving off the road.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>November 487 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had been to Neue Sanssouci many times, so many that he had lost count, so it wasn’t unfamiliarity that was making him nervous as he waited in the formal hall for the audience with the Kaiser. He had even been to these audiences before, tagging along after Duke Braunschweig a couple times, so he was familiar with the procedure. Every party who had some stake in the business of the day was gathered in the great hall, waiting for the Kaiser to come in and give his judgements or favors or, more rarely, punishments to those he needed to speak to. Lately, because of the Kaiser’s declining health, this duty had often been performed by the prime minister, instead. As Yang stood in the hall, shuffling nervously on his toes, he expected that it would be Lictenlade’s dour figure who emerged from the heavy doors at the end of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were a great number of other people in attendance, though Yang doubted that most of them had anything to do with his summons. The Kaiser had many diverse pieces of business to attend to in these forums. But it made the room crowded, and the looks that Yang received from many of the nobles standing across from him were unpleasant in the extreme. Yang wondered if this was just the normal looks, or if these ones were now tinged with something else— fear, maybe. Having gone to single handedly attack Lord Castrop’s planet, what was stopping Yang from going after any other noble?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Duke Braunschweig had received an invitation to this audience, as had Count Mariendorf, and, strangely, Magdalena. Yang imagined that, since they were all associated with him, they had been invited to witness whatever Lichtenlade had to say. Count Mariendorf brought Hilde with him, but Hilde had been very disappointed to find that Duke Braunschweig had not brought his own daughter to tag along. So, she was standing with Magdalena, waiting for the whole show to start. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had only gotten to say a few words in greeting to the count, and he wasn’t sure if he had been forgiven yet. He didn’t deserve to be forgiven, of course, but he had to think that getting yelled at by the crown might earn him some sympathy on that front.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig was not in a pleasant mood. Yang could tell from the way that Braunschweig coldly looked around, but he kept a smile on his face for the rest of the court. At least there weren’t any members of the Littenheim clan in attendance, which prevented Braunschweig’s mood from getting out of hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang steered clear of the duke, which was easy enough, because Braunschweig usually wanted nothing to do with him at public social events. This suited them both well. But all of this meant that Yang was standing by himself, just watching as everyone who needed to speak to the Kaiser filed in. If Magdalena hadn’t been so absorbed in chatting with Hilde, she would have come over and smacked Yang’s hands away from his hair. He kept running his fingers through it, his usual nervous habit, and while it had been combed smooth to match the neat appearance of his dress uniform when he arrived, it was now quite floppy and out of sorts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the appointed time approached, the room ceased to be a casual social gathering, and everyone took up their final positions in the room, lined up along the carpet, looking expectantly towards the front. A minute or so before the clock struck, one last guest walked in: Fleet Admiral Muckenburger. He ended up in a position directly across from Yang, people shuffling positions to give him room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The great doors swung open. Unsurprisingly, it was Lichtenlade who walked in, accompanied by secretaries and guards. Yang felt the kind of relief that came with a bad premonition finally coming true, and his shoulders slumped. Fleet Admiral Muckenburger’s eyes followed Yang’s changed posture, and his lips twitched in an almost invisible frown. Yang averted his eyes, and tried to stand up straighter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The business of the day, which Lichtenlade began to address without any fanfare whatsoever, was extensive, and in the long first section, none of it had anything to do with Yang. He almost completely tuned it out, but anxiety made him listen for his own name. He idly wondered what Muckenburger was here for, because so far none of the petitions that Lichtenlade heard and addressed had anything to do with the military. Muckenburger, too, seemed to be in his own thoughts, not reacting to any of the business passing before him as he stood perfectly at attention and looked straight ahead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The minutes dragged on. After some time, Lichtenlade fell silent, having perhaps addressed everyone in the room, aside from Yang. He made a signal to some of the guards, and they turned and opened the heavy doors at the end of the room once again. Lichtenlade stepped back, and Kaiser Friedrich walked out. The whole room’s tenor changed completely, everyone shifted (aside from Muckenburger), even if they had the good grace not to gasp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had only been about a year since Yang had last seen the Kaiser in person, but he looked much worse than he had at Count Marbach’s funeral. He had lost a significant amount of weight, and his face seemed like his skin revealed every contour of his skull. The Kaiser wasn’t even </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>old, so it seemed clear to Yang that he was suffering from some sort of illness, and possibly had been for quite some time. Either his decline was progressing more rapidly than it had been, or he had given up efforts to disguise it, or a combination.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sight of him in this state made Yang feel very strange. He was the Kaiser of the Galactic Empire, an institution that Yang despised on principle. He was a lecherous old man, one who wielded too much power that he had no right to. But his ill health meant that billions of people were about to be plunged into a civil war, which was a tragedy that Yang wished he could prevent, even by keeping the Kaiser alive. And, beyond all that, beyond every political consideration: Friedrich had always been unduly kind to Hank von Leigh. The sadness that Yang felt, gazing at the Kaiser, was, at least in part, a personal one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wondered, sparing a glance around the rest of the room, if there was a single other person who felt the same. Not Lichtenlade, not Muckenburger, not Count Mariendorf or Magdalena, and certainly not Duke Braunschweig. Perhaps Yang was the only one who bothered to see Friedrich as he was— a sad and lonely old man. It was Friedrich’s fault, Yang supposed, for clinging so completely to the power that kept him from being cared for as a person, but it still was a lonely existence, to be nothing more than a vessel for power, empty of all human spirit, in everyone’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shook himself out of his contemplation as the Kaiser sat down on his chair at the head of the room, and everyone held their breath, waiting for him to speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Mariendorf,” he said, stretching out his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone, including Yang, was surprised by this summons, but the count stepped out before the Kaiser and knelt. “Your Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Mariendorf, I sent you as an agent of the crown to bring Maximillian von Castrop before me. I am told that you were taken hostage, and you have suffered as the crown’s agent.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Your Majesty. I apologize for failing to bring him before you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Kaiser waved his hand. “He is dead, it makes little difference now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were freed from your captivity by an agent of Duke Braunschweig, is that correct?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Your Majesty. Captain von Leigh was responsible for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So I’ve heard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Majesty, it was at my daughter’s request that Duke Braunschweig lent his strength to free me,” he said. “It was not meant as an insult to the crown.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Mariendorf, if I had sent my fleets to Planet Castrop, do you believe that they would have succeeded in freeing you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This put the count in a very awkward position, and from his place on the floor, his eyes flicked around the room. “I’m not a military man, Your Majesty. And Lord Castrop was a fickle and vindictive person— I don’t know what he would have done if a whole fleet had arrived at his doorstep. I couldn’t speak of hypotheticals like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very well.” The Kaiser looked at him for a long second. “This duty was performed for the crown, but it was your loyalty to Duke Braunschweig which saved you, was it not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Majesty, if I may speak plainly—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You may.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am very grateful to Duke Braunschweig for loaning me his aid. I will owe him a debt for my entire life. But I do not doubt that, had Duke Braunschweig refused to loan my daughter a ship and crew, my daughter would have found some other way to try to free me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Captain von Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The count hestated. He was clearly trying to protect Yang— Hilde was relatively untouchable as a political figure, since she had very little power and there would be no point in punishing her, so it was easy to say that she would have done something, true as it was. Yang was a different story— for him to be Duke Braunschweig’s agent was one thing, for him to act independently was another. Yang wasn’t sure which was preferable, in the eyes of the crown. But Count Mariendorf was an honest man. “Yes, Your Majesty. Captain von Leigh would have, as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He must value your friendship very highly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand that this has been a difficult ordeal for you, on the crown’s business,” the Kaiser said. “If you wish to be released from your duties to the crown, I release you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Your Majesty,” the count said. “I prefer to put this incident behind me. So long as Your Majesty has use of my services, I am happy to provide them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So long as I have use of them,” the Kaiser said, with a dark half-laugh. “Very well. That is all,  Count Mariendorf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The count stood, and with some relief, went back to his spot. Hilde’s eyes were wide, and when her father returned to her side, she put her hand on his arm, and whispered something in his ear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain von Leigh,” the Kaiser said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang resisted the urge to sigh, and instead walked over to the spot where Count Mariendorf had just been kneeling. He didn’t have a choice, so he knelt to receive whatever chastising he was about to get. He didn’t think there had been a time when he had knelt for the Kaiser before. It was giving him a new appreciation for the fine gold details woven into the rug before him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I read your letter, Captain von Leigh,” the Kaiser said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad that it made it to you, Your Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were very presumptuous in it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, Your Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Mariendorf believes that you would go to great lengths for your friends. Is this true?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How can I deny that, Your Majesty?” It was Yang’s turn to laugh, even though he shouldn’t have, and he lifted his head to look around at the court. “There’s a half dozen people in this room who would tell you that I have behaved unreasonably for my friends at every opportunity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who would say that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Mariendorf family, Baroness Westpfale, Duke Braunschweig... Even Fleet Admiral Mucken—” He cut himself off when he felt the fleet admiral’s cold stare on him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that true, Muckenburger?” the Kaiser asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Your Majesty,” the fleet admiral said, without leaving his spot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.” The Kaiser stared at Yang for a second. “In your letter, you wondered if there had ever been any friendship between us. If there had been, what would you expect me to do for you, Captain Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Majesty, I was being presumptuous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Answer the question.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing, Your Majesty,” Yang said. “I wouldn’t ever ask you for anything for my own sake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you asked to be punished in Duke Braunschweig’s stead. Did he order you to say that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Your Majesty. I asked that because it was my decision to destroy the Necklace, to chase Lord Castrop, and everything else. It was my responsibility, and shouldn’t fall to anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you asked for the crown to give special care to Lord Castrop’s people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Your Majesty.” Yang lifted his head to look at the Kaiser. “Not for my own sake— but those people deserve more than Lord Castrop was allowing them. I hope that you will consider it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have considered it, Captain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And?” He regretted the question as soon as he asked it, but, even kneeling, Yang couldn’t help but speak his mind when it came to things like that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Has there been friendship between us, Captain Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Majesty, how can I answer that question?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Every question I’ve ever asked you, you’ve answered honestly. I would hope that you would answer this one in the same way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Majesty, it’s not for me to decide. The gap between us— in station, in life, in everything— is too large. If Your Majesty wishes to consider me a friend, then I am honored by that consideration. If Your Majesty considers me to be a humble servant, then this is what I am.” He paused, then continued. “Someone who I care about very deeply told me once that it is difficult to be someone’s subordinate and their friend at the same time. I believe he was correct to say so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Kaiser’s silence stretched on, making Yang deeply uncomfortable. Everyone in the room seemed to be holding their breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re marrying Baroness Westpfale?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was startled by the complete non-sequitur, but the Kaiser’s voice was calm, so Yang answered. “In the spring, Your Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I regret that I will be unable to attend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I— I wasn’t really expecting you to, to be honest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Kaiser ignored this. “I should give you your wedding gift now. There won’t be a better time for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Majesty, I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come here, Captain Leigh,” the Kaiser said. He held out his hand to one of the assistants standing by, and that man handed him a silver capped scroll, which he unrolled. Yang stepped forward, already completely off balance. He had no idea what was going on. Everyone’s eyes were upon him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Hank von Leigh, over the years I have known you, you have rendered service to the crown many times. Today you have destroyed the power of the traitor Maximillian von Castrop, and rescued the crown’s servant, Count Mariendorf. You have displayed great honesty, courage, and care for the people of the Empire. To that end, I, Kaiser Friedrich IV, grant to you the title of Lord. To you, I give all the forfeit property belonging to the traitor.  And to you, I entrust the lands and people of Planet Castrop, as you so eloquently argued for the crown’s protection for them. You understand well the rights and responsibilities that this gives to you. Use them wisely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was the last thing that Yang had expected or wanted, and he felt dizzy and ill. “Your Majesty—” was all he could say. He wanted to protest the gift, to reject it, but he couldn’t even form the words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Kaiser was holding out the silver capped scroll towards Yang, waiting for Yang to take it. “Is the gap between us small enough, now, Lord Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The honest and true answer was that no matter how high Yang was raised, the gap could not be closed. For there to be no gap, there would have to be no power between them, or between anyone, for that matter. But, because there was a gap, because the Kaiser had power over him, had something that he wanted Yang— Leigh— to say, Yang lied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Your Majesty. It is. Thank you.” He took the scroll, gripping it so tightly with his left hand that the paper dented beneath his fingernails.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Kaiser nodded, then waved his hand to dismiss Yang. Without another word the Kaiser stood and walked slowly back out of the room, followed by all the guards and Lichtenlade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as the door shut behind him, the room, which had been dead silent, erupted into chaos. Every noble in the room seemed to have something to say, either to Yang or at him, or about him. Magdalena, who had been grinning widely, realized that the sentiment in the room was approaching dangerous, and tried to step towards Yang, along with the Mariendorfs. But it was Fleet Admiral Muckenburger who got to Yang first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Leigh, if I may speak with you for a moment?” Muckenburger asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had only a split second to choose between a rock and a hard place, but it was Muckenburger’s use of his rank which convinced him. Yang nodded, and Muckenburger parted the crowd with his authoritative stride and glares, and led Yang out through the nearest side door. It was quieter in the hallway, and luckily, no one followed them. Muckenburger didn’t bother bringing Yang to his office— once they were safely away from the crowd, in one of the dark, wood paneled hallways, he turned towards Yang, who had been following rather meekly at his heels.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t take up too much of your time, Captain Leigh,” Muckenburger said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.” Yang ran his hand through his hair, forgetting military discipline for the moment. Muckenburger’s eyes were disapproving, but he said nothing. “What is it that you needed?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need anything, at the moment, Leigh, but I wanted to make something very clear to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this about— I swear I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Muckenburger said. “I don’t care one bit about court politics.” Yang remembered that Muckenburger was actually a count, but he had never once heard anyone refer to him that way. He hardly even acted like a noble— in Yang’s eyes he had always been some kind of embodiment of the fleet itself, and nothing else. Even if the fleet tended towards being aristocratic in nature, Muckenburger at least tried not to let that stand in his way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That makes two of us, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger barked out a laugh. “No, it does not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang winced. “What was it that you needed to tell me, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger stared at him, meeting his eyes, and Yang wanted to flinch away. “My duty, Captain, now and until I am no longer serving in the Imperial Fleet, is to protect this nation from disaster.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir. I know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you also understand that a fight between noble families will make this nation unacceptably weak.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you saying, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am saying that the first line of defense for this nation is Iserlohn Fortress. You are a competent man, Captain Leigh. I already knew that. But if you were attempting to send a message with the Artemis Necklace—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir, I wasn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A message was received nonetheless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want to describe your motives as selflessness, and friendship. But I know that you could have found some way to remove Castrop without touching a single link of that Necklace. You decided on a show— maybe even on Duke Braunschwieg’s orders. Am I wrong, Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I chose the path I thought would lead to the least loss of life,” Yang said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that is true, then let me warn you that your current path will not achieve the same result.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what you mean, sir.” Yang’s heart was sinking into his stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You might be able to take down Iserlohn Fortress,” Muckenburger said. “I can see what you’re doing, and I don’t doubt that you’ll succeed, if you have the right resources in play. You have the talent, if nothing else, and you don’t need to keep proving it to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang stayed totally silent— there was nothing he could say— but the blood drained from his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But let me remind you, Captain: it will be me that you will need to pass through, because protecting that fortress is protecting this Empire, regardless of who her leader is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to be your enemy, sir,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good day, Captain Leigh,” Muckenburger said, and with that, he strode off down the hallway. Yang didn’t chase after him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luckily, Yang’s disappearance from the crowd had allowed the crowd to disperse, and so Yang was able to peek back around a corner and find Magdalena waiting for him, leaning against the wall, the picture of relaxation, even if he knew her well enough by now to guess that this was probably as much of a carefully controlled persona as anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you thought this would go badly!” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shoved the silver scroll into her hands. “Let’s get out of here,” he said.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Although Magdalena acted nothing but thrilled about Yang’s change in fortunes, Yang couldn’t bring himself to share her enthusiasm. When she sent him back to his apartment, leaving him alone with his thoughts for the first time that day, Yang could do nothing but pace back and forth in front of the fireplace, occasionally interrupting his tracks around the room to go run over to his desk and scribble a passing thought down on a scrap of paper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had no desire to rule, or inherit, or participate in the structure of Imperial society. It was a cruel joke that the Kaiser was playing on him, and the Kaiser had to know that. Friedrich had always appreciated Yang for his complete lack of enthusiasm in the palace’s power games: he wasn’t a crawling status seeker; he was nobody, and wanted to stay nobody. Friedrich probably was amused at Yang’s expense, even if the gift, and talk of friendship, had been genuine. He probably thought that giving Yang status of his own would be a way to protect him after his death, moreso than just being married to Magdalena. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fact that the Kaiser’s generosity probably was real only made it feel worse. He seemed to genuinely believe that Yang was capable of running a planet. To hear Magdalena say it, Yang was barely capable of dressing himself in the morning. Why should he have power over a million other people? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew that these whining thoughts were born out of a helpless bitterness, and completely unproductive for it, but that didn’t stop him from having them. He’d reach the end of his room in his pacing, have some other aspect of the situation occur to him (“And another thing!”) and turn angrily on his heel to complain to an imaginary audience on his way across the floor in the other direction. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang exhausted himself with this, but it was at least better that he got it out of his system by the time he reported for work the next day, trying to slink back into his office like nothing had changed. Luckily, Braunschweig was always cloistered in his manor, and while the other officers had some gossip that filtered through into Yang’s ears, no one bothered him about it directly. Perhaps that was the kind of thing that new status granted him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even Kircheis said nothing, until he came up to Yang’s office to ask about a delivery of supplies intended for Cahokia. He got through his business quickly, but Yang’s constant distracted glances out the window made him finally ask, “Are you alright, sir?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you, Kircheis?” Yang asked. He smiled at Kircheis, who, in his endless patience, did not seem to mind Yang’s latest attempt to slip back into his teacher persona to free himself from thinking about his own troubles. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine, sir.” He sounded fine, but then he hesitated and added, “Hilde told me that she met Reinhard on Phezzan.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded. “So I’m told.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did that have anything to do with you, sir?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to apologize for using your friend like that?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir, of course not.” He looked away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told Muller to do whatever he could to help,” Yang said. “I knew that would probably involve your friend, as they have some sort of working relationship, there on Phezzan.” He tilted his head to study Kircheis. “Your friend seems like a good man.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Kircheis smile, a seemingly involuntary expression of happiness that brightened his whole countenance. “Hilde said he has a reputation for freeing captives.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d love to meet him, someday.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someday.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll sue for peace sooner, rather than later, if I have anything to do with it,” Yang said. He thought about Muckenburger’s warning, frowning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope so, sir.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you agree with me, at least.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde said the same thing, so that makes three.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang laughed. “I can always count on her.” But then he sighed and glanced out the window again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really, sir, are you alright?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just distracted, Kircheis,” Yang said. “I wish I hadn’t had a new set of responsibilities dropped on my lap.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I ask what you are going to do about, er, your holdings?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can ask. I don’t have a good answer.” He shuffled some objects around on his desk and pulled out a notebook, in which he had been jotting down his thoughts all morning. “I suppose— I mean, there’s only one moral thing to do, I’ll put all of the money into a trust for the people there, and I’ll, I don’t know…” He scratched the back of his head. “Rule of law, er, maybe I can get the people there to choose someone to manage the land… I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound like a republican, sir,” Kircheis said, but he was smiling, teasing Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, don’t let anybody hear you say that, Kircheis,” he said with a laugh. A sudden, funny thought came to him. “Your friend, Herr Bufholtz— does he want to work for me? I’d trust him to administer things fairly.” He was only half joking, and Kircheis actually seemed to consider it for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think he’d enjoy it very much, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m not enjoying it either, Kircheis!” But Yang laughed. “You know— that does give me a good idea, though. I should ask Fraulein Hilde if she’d like to assist me. She’s going to take over her father’s estate, someday. I think she knows what would be necessary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could ask her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I will,” Yang said, making his decision. “I really should go see the Mariendorfs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Although Yang had professed his desire to go visit the Mariendorfs with nothing but an honest heart and good intentions, he procrastinated. He felt, still, perhaps always, like a child who knew they had done something wrong. It was the same feeling that had kept him away from Count Mariendorf after he returned home in disgrace from El Facil. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, he waited until Magdalena really snapped at him one day after dinner, while they sat in her living room. She kept asking Yang questions about what his plans were, and she grew more and more frustrated by his complete lack of answers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hank, if you don’t want to let me manage your property for you, which I am more than capable of doing, you need to figure out what you’re doing with it. And if you won’t take advice from me, gods know you have plenty of other people to take advice from.” She shook her head, and poked him in the chest. “Stop acting like a little baby about it. It’s like you’re some sort of third rate son who’s sad about inheriting because that means you have to do work now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s exactly what I am,” Yang whined. “When my father died, it was a great mercy that he didn’t leave me with anything that I had to be responsible for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, wait, I changed my mind,” Magdalena said, scowling. “That’s not who you’re acting like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who, then?” Yang asked. He covered his eyes with his arm, leaning back on the couch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re reminding me very much of your very silly friend, Oskar.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang lifted his arm to peek at Magdalena, who had real anger in her voice. “Leave him out of it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Woe is me, I’ve inherited something,” Magdalena taunted. And then, in a weirdly accurate impression of Reuenthal’s venomous tone, she said, “Money I have no use for, and a land I never wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want me to say?” Yang asked. “I don’t understand why you care.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Augh!” She got up from the couch and stomped across the room. “You have to stop pretending like you can live in a different world than the rest of us!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I’ve ever pretended to live in a different world,” Yang said. “I’m well aware of what life is like, Maggie.” His left hand was resting on his lap, and, out of old memory, he ran his fingers over the scar on his thigh. It wasn’t large, but the raised bump was detectable even through the fabric of his pants.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re still acting like you can do whatever you want, and ignore the things you’re expected to do. It’s not a gift— it’s a leash, Hank. You do what you’re supposed to, and hope nobody decides to strangle you with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I promise that I’ll deal with it,” Yang said. “I know why the Kaiser gave it to me— I’m not trying to pretend I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stomped over to the windows, looking out over her garden, light from the house barely casting a glow over the frost-crisp lawn and the bare, tangled bushes. “Fine,” she said. “As long as you understand.” She didn’t sound happy at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang got up and went over to her, seeing her scowling reflection in the glass. He noticed that she was twisting her engagement ring around her finger. “Are you really unhappy with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t believe I’m marrying some stupid lord,” she muttered. “You were more fun when you were nobody.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The delivery was so quintessentially Maggie— something like a complete truth announced in a tone that no one could doubt was a joke. He understood the issue, then. He wanted to assure her that if she didn’t want to get married, they didn’t have to, Kaiser’s wedding gift or no, but that wouldn’t have helped. No matter what he said, she would double down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m still the same person I’ve always been,” Yang said. “Being called ‘Lord Leigh’ doesn’t change who I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And who is that, Hank?” she asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He should have told her his real name— it wouldn’t have cost him anything. But he didn’t. And since he didn’t have that to say, he didn’t have anything to give her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>A hole the light falls into</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thought, looking at his dark reflection in the window.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nevermind,” she said, when he was silent for a moment too long. She seemed to have recovered herself a little bit, and she flipped a switch in her persona, smiling a courtly smile and turning to touch his arm delicately. “I’m being difficult again.You should tell me off when I start being unreasonable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not being unreasonable,” he said. “I think you’re right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yang went to the Mariendorf house the next day. Hilde was away, staying late for the day at her university, so it was just the count who was there to speak to him, at least when he arrived. According to her father, she was supposed to be back soon, but Yang had no idea what ‘soon’ meant. And, besides, it was probably for the best that he could speak with the count alone. Hilde would jump far too quickly to Yang’s defense, had she been there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat down in the library, on plush chairs next to each other, and the count gave them both glasses of whiskey before they said anything much. Yang looked down into his glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seem very unhappy, Hank,” Franz said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked up at him. “I came to apologize to you, sir,” he said. “I shouldn’t try to pretend that I haven’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I expected that you would, at some point.” Franz looked out the window. The first snows of the winter were drifting down: sparse flakes that melted immediately when they touched the windowpane. “Hilde has told me over and over not to blame you for putting her in danger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s far too generous to me. I knew when I set out that… you might never forgive me for putting her in danger. And I knew I shouldn’t have done it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did you, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was a difficult question to answer. “She demanded to go,” Yang said. “I know that’s not an excuse, but it’s the truth.” He looked down into his hands. “A good friend of mine recently made me think about… what it means to be responsible for other people— as a leader, I mean. Sometimes people value what they can accomplish, what they can do for other people, more than they value their safety. If I refuse to respect that, then…” He took a sip from his glass not wanting to say anymore. But Count Mariendorf was silent, and waited for him to continue. “I know that I should feel it’s more relevant to soldiers than to your daughter, but Hilde wouldn’t have forgiven me if I hadn’t let her her participate. And she had already asked the Braunschweigs before I had even put together a plan that didn’t involve her. I was going to ask the duke to loan me to whatever fleet Muckenburger was going to send— to see if there was anything I could do. But…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s not a soldier,” Franz said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir. I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a moment for Franz to say anything more. “Her mother would have never let her do half as much as I’ve allowed. It makes me feel like a failure as a father. I’ve done something wrong in failing to protect her, in letting her think that she should run off into danger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think so, sir. She would never want anyone else as a father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I know,” he said. He closed his eyes, in pain, maybe. “That’s what makes it so difficult. She wouldn’t want anyone other than you as a teacher, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not her teacher anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As a friend, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She thinks too highly of me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, she doesn’t,” Franz said. “I think her estimation is accurate. She’s always been a very good judge of character.” He finished his glass of whiskey. “I’m sure that’s why she knew she could manipulate you into letting her go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was it manipulation, sir? She asked directly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A blunt instrument is still a tool,” he said. “I keep asking myself— would I be as angry, if she were my son?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it fair to her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That you might treat her differently if she was a boy— a man?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The count looked at him sidelong. “You’re right, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She is an adult. I should stop looking at her like she’s a child.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure it’s difficult to not see her that way. She’ll always be your daughter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made the count smile. “Yes, that’s also true.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s why I don’t really expect your forgiveness, or deserve it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be ridiculous, Hank.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded and looked down into his glass again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you like a son,” he said. “And I’m grateful to have you in my life. If Hilde had gone off on her own, rather than with your help, I’m certain— Well. I’ve forgiven you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir.” His throat felt raw saying it, and he was sure the count could hear that in his tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Franz said, false cheer in his voice, “that aside, how are you getting on with the land the Kaiser granted you? It was a very generous gift.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang winced. “I don’t really know, sir. It’s not a gift I particularly wanted, or think myself well suited to receive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am in complete agreement with the Kaiser that you will be a far cry better for the people on that planet than Castrop was. You’re a good and honest man— those are important qualities in a lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned. “I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does that mean, ‘you suppose’?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He glanced at the count with a wry and half ashamed smile. The count was vaguely aware of Yang’s political bent, if only from his association with Martin via Kircheis, but probably didn’t ever think about what that meant in practical terms. “It doesn’t feel right for me to be a lord, sir. I never wanted that kind of power over people. I feel like I should find some way to let the place govern itself. I’ve put the money in a trust for them already— I don’t need the money. It should go pretty far towards improving their standard of living.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Franz was silent for a long time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume you don’t approve, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Hank, I do not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just— why should I be allowed to dictate the way that a million people live their lives?” Yang asked, spreading his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a second for Franz to compose his answer. “It’s because you are a good man, that it is your responsibility. You are intelligent, and capable, and fair. You cannot abdicate your responsibility, pass it off to the crowd, because you don’t like the burden that it places on you. Someone has to make decisions, someone has to carry that weight. It’s a duty of care, Hank. You can’t hand it off to someone who might not be able to carry it. Certainly, there are few people I would say are more capable than you, and I doubt there are many living on that planet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not really about capability, sir,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m a soldier, sir. I know I couldn’t go into a battle and ask the soldiers to vote on what we should do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is no different, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it is.” Yang tugged at the hair on the back of his head. “People should have the ability to decide how to live their lives.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not like you’re decreeing what everyone should eat for breakfast,” the count said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, but I would decide the law, and how the law is enforced, and if I were a petty tyrant I could kill people for petty offenses. Castrop certainly did. He shouldn’t have had that power— and not just because he was a bad ruler, but because no one should have that power.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” the count said, though he sounded like he didn’t agree whatsoever. “But that doesn’t change the facts. You still are the lord, and you are responsible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Yang said. “I actually also came here to ask Hilde something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure as your heir, she’s had more of an education on running an estate than I’ve had.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did you want to ask her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If she wants the position of administering it for me,” Yang said. “I figured she would enjoy the work, and it would give her some experience— she’ll want that for when she’s in charge of the Mariendorf lands.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The count considered it. “You can ask her. I have no real objections, but I suspect that she’ll say no.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s busier than you think she is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“With school?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. It seems like she failed to mention something to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In exchange for Duke Braunschweig’s help, she’s agreed to become Lady Elizabeth’s personal advisor. I expect that is going to take up quite a lot of her attention.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This thought ticked around in Yang’s brain. “And you approve of that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not my place to approve or disapprove.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you think of it, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think Lady Elizabeth is a complicated young woman, and being that close to power will be dangerous for Hilde. But if she wants that, then it’s her choice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do you think of it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Franz said. “I understand Duke Braunschweig, but I keep feeling like I’m completely out of touch with the younger generation. Maybe the world is changing, or maybe I’m just getting old.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not that old, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Franz laughed. “What will you do, if Hilde says no?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang sighed. “I will write up as comprehensive a directive as I can, and have the man Maggie recommends administer it for me,” he said. “She’s offered to take care of everything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Usually it’s the other way around, when a couple gets married,” Franz said. “But I’m glad that you have been blessed with a competent future wife.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She covers up my glaring weaknesses pretty well,” Yang said. He thought about their argument of the night before, the image of Maggie twisting the ruby engagement ring around her finger. He reached to refill his glass of whiskey, and the count didn’t object. “She’s too good for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>On Monday, Yang made his way to the Braunschweig manor. It was ostensibly a trip to discuss with Duke Braunschweig what supplies they needed to put on Cahokia, as well as various bases around the Empire, but Yang also wanted to see Elizabeth. He had a strange feeling about Hilde’s new position, and so he wanted to see what Elizabeth had to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, when he arrived at the Braunschweig house, she was nowhere to be seen. The butler said that she was out with her mother, and he led Yang to Braunschweig’s office, where another, even less pleasant, surprise was waiting for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach had returned from Cahokia, and he was standing behind Braunschweig, in his old spot at his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The look that Braunschweig gave Yang as he came into the office was a mixed one— distaste and calculation all at once. He waved at Yang to sit down in the chair before his desk, which Yang did. Ansbach looked straight ahead, not looking at Yang. This already made Yang deeply uncomfortable— the feeling of the room had changed, and it probably wasn’t just the fact that Ansbach had been away from Odin for so long.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang tried to ignore the discomfort that crawled along his back, and he put a smile on his face. “Good morning, Duke Braunschweig. And I didn’t expect to see you back here so soon, Captain Ansbach,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I asked him to return when you left for your little errand on planet Castrop,” Braunschweig said. “It took some time for him to wrap up his business there and come back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m glad to see you again,” Yang said, at least trying to come off genuine. They had parted on better terms than they had ever been on, so he hoped that would continue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m honored, Lord Leigh,” Ansbach said. He stared straight ahead, and his voice didn’t have even the slightest quiver of sarcasm in it. This, perhaps more than anything else, made Yang feel sick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig laughed. “I’m certain </span>
  <em>
    <span>this </span>
  </em>
  <span>was something you never expected, Ansbach.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, my lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t either,” Yang said, rubbing the back of his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you’re lucky, Leigh,” Braunschweig said. “I’m very happy for you, of course, but there are many people in the court who don’t feel half as pleased as I do. If you didn’t have my protection, the Kaiser’s generosity might have been deadly.” The threat could barely even be considered veiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think the Kaiser was trying to protect me, sir,” Yang said. “He has a different view of things, looking down on the rest of us, than we do looking up at him, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How astute.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad that you aren’t upset by it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would I possibly be upset?” Braunschweig asked. He wasn’t a very good liar. “You’ve been telling me for months that I should court more rich and powerful allies into my court, and here you’ve just landed in my lap.” He smiled. “And, of course, I’m pleased that the Kaiser didn’t see fit to punish you. I would have hated to lose a talented officer on a jaunt like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of that,” Braunschweig said. “I’m promoting you.” He opened one of his desk drawers and handed Yang an envelope. “Congratulations, Commodore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really?” Yang asked, alarmed. “What for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Services to the crown,” Braunschweig said in a flat voice. “After the Kaiser was so pleased with your performance with the Artemis Necklace, how could I not reward it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, Yang decided, he was just still afraid of his father-in-law, worried that if the Kaiser’s favorite wasn’t treated well under Braunschweig’s care, the Kaiser still had power to do something about it. Yang idly wondered what that might be— would the Kaiser raise him still higher? The idea made Yang’s head spin. And he didn’t want to be a flag officer, either. Especially not for no reason. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s panicked, roving gaze landed on Ansbach, who was very deliberately not looking at Yang. The sudden injustice of it all struck him, and he was compelled to open his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will Captain Ansbach be promoted as well?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The silence that descended on Braunschweig’s office was even worse than the silence of the tomb.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just think— I mean— he’s been a captain for longer than I have been, and he just spent so long on the front, and getting Cahokia set up was… important.” He trailed off and rubbed his head. “It just seems fair, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll consider it.” Braunschweig said, in the flattest, dullest voice imaginable. “What was it that you wanted to discuss about Cahokia?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Relieved to change the subject, Yang pulled out the papers he had prepared for requisitions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The meeting proceeded as normally as it could, though Yang never approached feeling comfortable. It ended unexpectedly, when Braunschweig got a phone call from one of his relatives, and dismissed both Yang and Asbach from his office. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anbach immediately strode off down the hallway, without saying a single word to Yang. He was certainly aware that Yang followed him, down the steps into the servants’ hall in the basement of the building, but he said nothing. The only time he stopped was to open a rickety set of drawers in the hallway, from which he pulled out a couple things that Yang couldn’t see. He stuck them in his pockets, and then marched out of the house. The door to the outside nearly slammed shut in Yang’s face when Ansbach went out, letting it shut behind him. Yang caught it just before it could hit his nose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Outside, Ansbach was standing in the light dusting of snow on the ground, a cigarette pinched between his lips as he tried to shield it from the wind and light it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t know you smoked,” Yang said. He sat down on the stone step, looking up at Ansbach as he curled his arms around his knees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The servants hall isn’t a place for someone of your station, Lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, don’t,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t smoke, Lord?” he asked. “I’ll put it out for you.” He pulled the cigarette out of his mouth and looked at it. He hadn’t actually lit it yet— Yang had interrupted him before he could win his battle with the winter wind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ansbach—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t want this,” Yang said. “I didn’t ask for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach was silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was really hoping you, at least, wouldn’t treat me any differently.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will treat you as is befitting to your station and rank, Lord.” Yang was sure that Ansbach was aware of just how miserable this was making Yang, and was doing it on purpose, but that couldn’t be the whole story. But it was effective as a tactic, and if Yang had been a more aggressive person, he would have yelled. But instead, his shoulders just slumped further and further, and he leaned his chin on his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never wanted to be above anyone,” Yang said. “Not even when we were back in school. Those fucking class ranks— it was all so stupid. They had to make a game out of putting students at each other’s throats. I’m honestly surprised that I was the only one who ever almost got killed over it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach lit his cigarette.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess I was an easy target. Weak, or foreign, or both.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I forgive you for that, by the way,” Yang said. “You probably already knew that. But I guess I should say it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach’s cigarette was half gone before he said anything. “Why did you tell the duke to promote me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang tugged at his hair. “It’s not fair to you if he doesn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Life’s not fair.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you need to be the voice of reason around here.” He sighed. “We’re in the same boat—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We are not, Lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know we are,” Yang said. He scuffed at the snowy ground with his toe. “Forget the title. You know it doesn’t actually mean anything to Braunschweig except as some sort of threat from the Kaiser. If he thinks I’m not useful to him anymore, or if he decides he can’t stand me, the title won’t mean anything. We’re not his family. We don’t have—” He waved his hand, broadly encompassing everything he knew Ansbach already understood. “We’re always going to be on the outside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do you want me to do about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do about it? There’s nothing that anybody can </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> about it.” Not while the Empire remained as it was, anyway. But that wasn’t a conversation he could have with Ansbach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t have to be friends,” Yang said. “I know you hate me. But we can work together as equals. And that’s easier if you’re a commodore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine. We’ll see if he listens to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He trusts you. There isn’t any reason for him </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>to promote you. He just probably hadn’t thought about it yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you say so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why does he trust you so much, by the way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t trust me. He just doesn’t think about not trusting me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He does— he thought you were the right person to watch over me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach rolled his eyes, and dropped the stub of his cigarette. He ground the glowing ember into the snow with his heel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what’s the difference between those two things, anyway?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A world of difference.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Explain it to me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was a hall boy, in his country estate on Westerland,” Ansbach said. “My mother begged him to sponsor me to go to school. But the boy who blacks your boots never stops being just another part of the scenery.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose you won’t tell me where you come from, Lord.” Ansbach had lost his flat tone, and was openly mocking on the title. It was a significant improvement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phezzan,” Yang lied. But he smiled at Ansbach, who shook his head and stepped past him to go back inside.</span>

  <p>
  <em>
    <span>December 487 I.C., Iserlohn Fortress</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal had not kept much with him in the way of personal property on his flagship, which made packing it all up easier. He had never thought of himself as a sentimental man, but, as he walked the halls of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ostberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> for the last time, he found himself standing in doorways, peering into empty rooms, feeling a tug in his chest. The ship, which was at the end of its service life, was set to be used as a training vessel for a few years, and then scrapped. It and the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Westberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> had been some of the last ships in their class to be in service, and it had only been a matter of time before the two ships would be retired. Now that Reuenthal and Mittermeyer were being transferred back to Odin, that time had come.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He walked off the ship one last time, carefully not giving it a single backwards glance until he was far enough from it that no one was paying attention to his moment of weakness. He looked at it through the long windows that overlooked Iserlohn’s drydock, felt strange, and hurried away to the bar where Mittermeyer was waiting for him. They would both be on a passenger transport back to the capital in a few hours, but there was time before then to drink and talk in the semi-privacy afforded by a corner booth at a bar. He wasn’t sure how much time they would be able to spend together while en route— and, besides, Mittermeyer always got antsy in the few days before he was to leave Iserlohn; Reuenthal found it hard to believe that this trip would be any different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bar was crowded and dark. Although it was one meant only for officers, this didn’t make it any less busy. It was the time of the month when personnel reassignments were going out, and so there were a higher number of people than usual inside, doing exactly as Reuenthal and Mittermeyer were: celebrating or mourning transfers. Paradoxically, the more crowded the bar was, the easier it was for their conversations to remain private.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer was already sitting in the back of the bar, and had already gotten drinks for himself and Reuenthal. There were two untouched beers in front of him, and shoved one over to Reuenthal as he sat down without saying a word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal raised his glass silently, and they had an unspoken toast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The beer took his mind off the desolate </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ostberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, as did seeing Mittermeyer, his flaxen hair reflecting the dim yellow lights of the bar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal finally said,“I won’t ask you if you’re pleased to be leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At least our punishment is over.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I won’t have to do any more patrols, at least,” Mittermeyer said. “And I’ve never heard anyone else say that a do-nothing job in the capital is a punishment. Most people think it’s a vacation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Having my flagship scrapped seems like a punishment to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer frowned into his beer. “Don’t remind me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yours isn’t even being used for training is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Mittermeyer said. “She’s headed for the scrapyard immediately. Unless they use her as target practice first. She got too beat up when I had to go pull Leigh out of the corridor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal gave a dark chuckle. “And I crashed your car— you seem to have some bad luck concerning vehicles.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll make a note to never buy a yacht when I retire, in case you or Leigh need me to scuttle it for some reason.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sound choice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer sighed. He fished around in his pocket for something, and pulled out a little metal emblem: the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Westberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>’s symbol, wrought in bronze, which he had clearly pried out of the door to his office on the ship. He tossed it to Reuenthal. “There’s your memento.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal reached into his own pocket and pulled out the matching one. They were sister ships, and the two emblems mated perfectly, forming an old city map of a place on Ancient Earth that had once been split in two. He laid them together on the table for a moment, just looking at it, then flicked the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ostberlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>’s emblem towards Mittermeyer, who picked it up and turned it over in his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not a punishment,” Mittermeyer said. “You know it’s political.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After what Leigh did with the Artemis Necklace, Muckenburger’s got his eyes firmly fixed on Iserlohn. He couldn’t just let us stay here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh wouldn’t need us to sabotage it from the inside,” Reuenthal said. “Muckenburger should know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He probably does, but it’s still smart for him to reassign us. And Leigh’s friend Oberstein— you’ve met him, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” Reuenthal couldn’t quite hide his distaste.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s out, too. I’m honestly surprised we weren’t all kicked out to the frontier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Taking away our fleets makes us powerless. Having a fleet but being far away would still mean that we posed threats. I don’t think Muckenburger has a choice, except to give us a ‘vacation’.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know if any of these other shufflings are for the same reason?” Mittermeyer glanced around at the busy room. “You know the people here better than I do, since I’m out on patrol all the time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. There’s not anybody that Leigh mentioned, but I don’t keep an exhaustive list of Braunschweig’s allies. And it might only be fair to kick out anyone from Littenheim’s camp, too. I don’t know if Muckenburger wants to look like he’s favoring them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure he doesn’t.” Mittermeyer finished his beer, and flagged down the waitress to get a new one. “Well, we’ll just have to make the best of our time on Odin. I’m sure if Leigh needs us, he’ll find us something to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you really want to work for Braunschweig?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could ask you the same question.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You already know what the answer is.” Under the table, Reuenthal slid his foot up Mittermeyer’s leg, which elicited no reaction other than Mittermeyer shifting subtly in his seat, allowing Reuenthal to press the heel of his black leather boot into the softest part of his thigh. It was dangerous, but no one could see them, and they were about to leave Iserlohn anyway, so he didn’t care. Through his heel, he couldn’t feel anything of Mittermeyer except the resistance of flesh, but it was enough to ground him in the moment. He drank his beer, too frothy and sour for his taste.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s been a long time since I had a post on Odin,” Mittermeyer said, changing the subject. “It will be nice to be in the same place as Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Failing to mention his wife didn’t do Mittermeyer any favors. It was almost worse when she hovered unmentioned in the edges of the conversation. It made it so there was almost nothing that could be discussed: the illicit was forbidden here in the bar, and the licit was avoided to spare Reuenthal’s feelings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before he gets married, you mean,” Reuenthal said, picking a knife to twist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And after, I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal let out a dark laugh. “I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you planning to go to the wedding?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m planning on it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But plans might change.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal looked at him cooly, perfectly cognizant of the position of his heel, and the warmth of Mittermeyer’s legs against his own. “I’ll go,” Reuenthal said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good.” He looked away. “I suppose it’s not for a few months, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh can enjoy a little more time as a free man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like I said, I don’t think marrying will make him any less free.” But he smiled. “The funny thing is— he wrote to me and told me all about how much he was trying to avoid all the trappings of being a count, but as soon as he goes through with all of this, he’ll be living in her mansion anyway.” Not saying Magdalena’s name was probably another accession to Reuenthal’s feelings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh considers being rich the cruelest turn of fortune’s wheel,” Reuenthal said. “I’m certain his fiancee is happy about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you say so? It’s not like she was after his money,” Mittermeyer said with a laugh. “If it’s ‘for richer or for poorer’, she agreed to marry him when he was definitely ‘poorer’.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She told me once that there’s always a use for money. I doubt she’s the type to turn up her nose at it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To be fair, I don’t think I would turn up my nose if the Kaiser decided to make me a count,” Mittermeyer said. “Leigh has a stronger backbone than I do, to hate it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound like you’re surprised. I thought you’d say something like ‘the most middle-class of dreams is the dream of being rich.’” Mittermeyer laughed. “I suppose it is pretty middle class of me. Besides, it’s never going to happen, so it’s a funny thing to imagine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you saying that you’d turn down the money and title?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no real desire for a heritable title. Even if I wanted to be lavishly rewarded by the Kaiser and join the ranks of the nobles, which I have no desire to do, I’m not going to have a child to pass the title down to. So it would be pointless. Passing titles down only ensures that someone incompetent will hold them, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The mention of children, or lack thereof, was a sore spot for Mittermeyer, as Reuenthal was well aware. But Mittermeyer could give as well as he got. “And you think that Leigh is going to have a child?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal’s mouth twitched in displeasure. “I doubt it. Westpfale doesn’t seem like the type.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The type?” Mittermeyer asked. “It’s not like it takes a certain kind of personality. And she’s probably been told since birth that she’ll have to pass down her title.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, you think they will?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Up to them. I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal had succeeded in making them both miserable, it seemed. This was what always happened when leaving Iserlohn. The fortress, with its artificial and regimented way of life, kept its occupants safe from the encroaching troubles of the natural world and polite society. For someone who fit into the natural order of the world, who fit into politie society, leaving Iserlohn for a safe desk job on Odin was a vacation. For Reuenthal, it was a kind of punishment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose it doesn’t matter,” Reuenthal said. “I don’t think Leigh would want to even think about it until after everything is resolved.” As part of his concession, he shifted his foot to relieve some of the pressure on Mittermeyer’s leg, but Mittermeyer, below the table, rested his free hand on his ankle, continuing to welcome it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re right.” Mittermeyer said. “This would be a bad time to have a child.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not that much worse than any time in the past hundred years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“True.” Mittermeyer shook his head. “Life keeps going on for everybody, even soldiers, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Until it doesn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be morbid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not— I’m just being realistic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>December 487 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal settled himself back in his home on Odin without the least bit of fanfare. He wanted to see Yang, but this seemed to involve passing through a gauntlet by the name of Magdalena, who, having learned through Mittermeyer’s wife that Reuenthal was back on the planet, invited Reuenthal to dinner with herself and Yang before Reuenthal could get a chance to speak to Yang on his own. On some level, it was his fault for having the bad habit of always trying to sneak back onto the planet— but he blamed Magdalena for the annoyance nonetheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They met at a restaurant, a place that was very upscale but was pretending that it belonged on Phezzan rather than Odin. It had neon lights of flickering blue and green, and the music was by a live band, something jaunty with a wailing singer whose lyrics Reuenthal attempted to tune out. They sat at a small, round table right near the stage, Magdalena having picked the spot. She kept smiling up at the singer, who was distractingly moving in and out of Reuenthal’s peripheral vision. The whole atmosphere set his teeth on edge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t the music good?” Magdalena asked, after they had gotten their drinks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know anything about music,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s another thing that I suspect I’ll have to fix about you pretty quickly,” Magdalena said. “You could use a broader education in the arts. It’s vital.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound like my father,” Yang grumbled. “He would always tell me that art and business are the only things worth studying. So, as an ungrateful son, I took the greatest pleasure in not studying either of them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmph,” Magdalena said. “Well, we’ll have to make up for his failures in imparting good taste.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a pity that your life has followed the wrong trajectory,” Reuenthal said. “What is it people say? ‘I study war so that my son may study business and diplomacy, and my son studies business so that his son may study art.’”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Men have been studying war since the dawn of time,” Magdalena said dismissively. “If a generational progression like that was even possible, it would have happened long before now. I simply suspect that there are too many men who prefer to study war rather than art.” She curled her lip at Reuenthal. “Or am I wrong about that, Oskar?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can hope for peace in this generation,” Yang said. “Even if it’s a short lived one, I’d like it. Some children should get to grow up without war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A pleasant fantasy,” Reuenthal said. He picked up his menu and studied it, rather than looking at Yang or Magdalena, or the wailing singer. Although he had said to Mittermeyer that Magdalena would not want children, he hadn’t even considered the possibility that Yang might. “But I suppose every child on Phezzan has grown up without war for many years. So, maybe it is possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s true!” Magdalena said. “Studying business and diplomacy seems to have done well for them, in that respect. Too bad that’s all their sons want to study, too.” She laughed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think it’s true that people on Phezzan grow up without war,” Yang said. “Their whole way of life is shaped by it, if indirectly.” He frowned down at his own menu. “Working hard to pretend something doesn’t exist is also a kind of acknowledgement that it does.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This cast a pall over the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is becoming acquainted with art something that all the nobility has to do?” Reuenthal asked Magdalena. “Or is Leigh’s art education a personal vendetta of yours?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, there are plenty who don’t,” Magdalena said. “I’m sure you’re aware of them all. But they’re all such boors, and hard to make conversation with. Hank is already at a disadvantage at parties. I have to make sure I’m not leaving him at further disadvantage socially by neglecting to give him a handful of safe conversation topics that he can choose from. Unfortunately for Hank, I know a lot more about art than I know about sports, or business.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang continued to scowl down at his menu.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, no love for art for art’s sake. It’s all a social game?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everything is a social game, darling. You’re lucky to know me, since I’m honest about that fact.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to wonder what other indignities you’re going to force him through. It surprises me that you haven’t completely thrown out his wardrobe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can take things one step at a time. Everyone in the capital, at least who I care about associating with, understands that these things will take some getting used to. And we’re busy planning our wedding, you know how it is. But I’m sure once we’re married—” Her voice was light, but her face was sharp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to make me into a project, Maggie,” Yang said, but he sounded resigned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s for your own health and safety,” Magdalena said bluntly. “I’m sure even Oskar understands that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘Even Oskar’?” Reuenthal asked. Magdalena just laughed. “And who are these supposed members of the nobility that you actively want to associate with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, there’s plenty. I couldn’t possibly name them all right now.” She tilted her head in a very predatory way. “But Oskar, I’m glad you brought up the subject, and I’m glad you’re back on Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s someone I want you to meet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s been off Odin for several years, but she’s finally made it back home. I think you’d get along with her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no interest in meeting your friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, she’s not a friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why would I care?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I want you to,” Magdalena said. “Are you going to the solstice party at the capitol?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I’m invited, it’s mandatory.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’ll be there. I’ll tell her to be on the lookout for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t like this asymmetry of information,” Reuenthal said, which made Magdalena laugh again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unfortunately, I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what are you hoping to get out of this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing,” Magdalena said. “This is out of the kindness of my heart. For you and for her. I’m sure you’ll understand when you meet her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The fact that you believe that introducing me to a woman is a kindness makes me think—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh don’t bother finishing that sentence, Oskar. I know what you think of me already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what is that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena just smiled. And then she turned to Yang. “What are you having for dinner, darling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal ground his teeth. Yang looked uncomfortable. He had been sinking down into his chair during the whole exchange between Reuenthal and Magdalena, and now he seemed reluctant to say a single word. It was unfortunate that Magdalena had chosen a restaurant for them to meet in, Reuenthal thought. They hadn’t exactly gotten along at dinners at their private residences, but in private, they could at least speak openly. And Magdalena would have felt less ownership over Yang— she might have him in public, but in private it was a different story. As if she could read his mind, she reached over to Yang and tucked some of his hair behind his ear, and then raised her glass at Reuenthal in a cheeky little toast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole meal was deeply frustrating, and it was made worse by Yang becoming quieter and quieter as the night wore on. As Yang paid the bill, Reuenthal asked, “Do you want me to give you a ride home?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please,” Yang said, with some relief in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they went out into the parking lot, Magdalena gave Yang a kiss goodnight, and she thankfully stopped short of trying to kiss Reuenthal’s cheeks as they stood out in the snow. She left for her own car in a swirl of petticoats and furs, leaving Yang and Reuenthal standing next to his car, the old one that had used to belong to his father. Without speaking, Reuenthal and Yang got in, and Reuenthal turned them towards Yang’s apartment. The snow was falling gently, but the roads were still clear. Reuenthal drove in silence for a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not taking me back to your place?” Yang asked, when he finally caught sight of a landmark that let him know which way he was heading.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I said I would drive you home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Yang said. “As long as you don’t mind my landladies. Your house does avoid that, at least.” He laughed, but it was just to break up the strange atmosphere, and it sounded anechoic and muffled in Reuenthal’s ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It surprises me that you haven’t moved into a larger house yet, now that you’re a count. You inherited some property in the capital, didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess,” Yang said. He rubbed the back of his head. “I’m going to be moving in with Maggie in a couple months, so there isn’t really a point in me uprooting my whole life before then. I like my apartment, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal turned towards the highway, and they sat at a red light, just watching the snow swirl in the empty intersection, counting the seconds until the light changed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is something the matter?” Yang finally asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not good at pretending that something isn’t wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing’s wrong,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright.” Yang wasn’t going to press, and he just leaned his head on the passenger window, watching the snow land in wet flakes on the glass as Reuenthal drove.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I ask you a question?” Reuenthal asked, breaking the silence once again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve been given a lot of money.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not a question.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could use it to pay off your debt, go back to Phezzan, get away from all of this. Free yourself. Live under your own name again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. It took a long time for him to continue, and when he did, his voice was rough and strained. “I feel responsible for things here. I keep telling people that I’m a servant of the whole Empire— the ordinary people, not just the Kaiser. If I don’t do something to take their lives into account, nobody else will. Or at least, nobody who’s in a position to do anything. I can’t leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.” Duty— that was all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was silent again for a long time. “And I’m a very selfish person,” he said. His head was pressed against the glass of the window, and his eyes were closed.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The solstice party in Neue Sanssouci was one that Reuenthal thought that he shouldn’t have had an invitation to, but on paper, there was no reason for him not to get one. Every flag officer in the capital who was part of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Reichsflotte</span>
  </em>
  <span>— not belonging to a private noble’s fleet— had been invited, along with sundry nobility and other court functionaries who Prime Minister Lichtenlade considered to be harmless enough. It seemed ridiculous that he and Mittermeyer had been invited, since they had just been kicked out of Iserlohn for their associations with Duke Braunschweig, via Yang, and Reuenthal wished that someone had realized this and scrubbed his name from the invite list. He had no desire to be here, but it was mandatory.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he complained to Yang about it, Yang just gave him a sympathetic smile and said, “Well, try to think of it as part of your paycheck. Besides, Mittermeyer will be there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, Mittermeyer being there meant that Mittermeyer’s cheerful wife was hanging onto his arm as they stood together in the dance hall. She and Reuenthal were doing their best not to acknowledge each other too much, but it was difficult. They stood near some pillars at the edge of the room, watching dancers narrowly avoid collision in their swirling dresses and crisp uniforms. Due to the more military nature of the party, the gender ratio was imbalanced, and there were plenty of single officers like Reuenthal who stood around the edges and simply watched the dancers. Not everyone had a wife to bring like Mittermeyer did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The party was sumptuously decorated and packed with people, though the mood remained strangely somber despite the cheerful music and energetic dancing. Perhaps it was due to the conspicuous lack of the Kaiser’s presence. The party was in the capitol, and at the front of the ballroom an elaborate seat was set up for the Kaiser, but there was no way he would make a showing. This was Lichtenlade’s party, and everyone knew it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh’s lucky to be in Braunschweig’s camp,” Mittermeyer said. “He’s missing out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure he avoided becoming a flag officer for so long just so that he would have the ability to avoid these kinds of things,” Reuenthal said. “He hates parties.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This one could be worse,” Mittermeyer said, looking around. “I don’t see anyone I particularly hate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s always time to make new enemies,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you planning on making enemies tonight?” Evangeline asked, looking around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope not,” Mittermeyer said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t try to,” Reuenthal said. “But it’s a good opportunity to learn what’s been going on in the Lichtenlade camp these days.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittemeyer nodded. “Listening to who is speaking to whom is always valuable, I suppose, even if no one could possibly be stupid enough to talk about their plans at a public party.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Across the room, Reuenthal could see Fleet Admiral Muckenburger, speaking with High Admiral Ovelesser. Neither of them looked particularly happy with the other, but those were two men who wouldn’t cowed— either by one’s rank or one’s physical stature. “I wouldn’t be so sure about that,” Reuenthal said, and he nodded over at them. “I wonder what they’re discussing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer raised his eyebrows. “Dissention in the ranks?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe. Do you know if Braunschweig is particularly friendly with the high admiral?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No idea. Do you want him to be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal scoffed. “You forgot what happened at Kapche-Lanka so quickly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I didn’t. I’m just more willing to forgive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened at Kapche-Lanka?” Evangeline asked. “Did High Admiral Ovelesser do something to annoy you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, er, it wasn’t much,” Mittemeyer said. “Just some tactical decisions that Reuenthal disagreed with.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of awkward silence between the three of them. Evangeline opened and closed her mouth, clearly aware that Mittermeyer was hiding something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was a long time ago, Frau Mittermeyer,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer coughed. “Right, it was. Can I get you both a drink?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, if Mittermeyer escaped the tense moment, that would leave Reuenthal and Evangeline standing there next to each other. This was something that neither of them wanted, but neither could refuse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, thank you,” Reuenthal said. “Wine, or something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One of those—” Eva pointed at someone who walked by carrying a thick looking mixed drink. “Whatever it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure,” Mittermeyer said, and vanished into the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Evangeline looked around for a second, clearly searching for a conversation topic and not finding one until the silence between them had already become unbearable. “Are you doing anything for the New Year, Herr Reuenthal?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reuenthal said. “I’m not planning on anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome to join Wolf and I. We’re not doing anything special, but I’m sure he would like your company.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It would have been hard to name anything less pleasant sounding than a night spent with Evangeline Mittermeyer’s pity. “I’ll think about it,” he said. “I appreciate the invitation.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked across the room, trying to find Mittermeyer in the line at the bar, but he didn’t stand out in the crowd, and so was invisible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I ask what did happen on Kapche-Lanka?” Evangeline asked. “I know Wolf doesn’t want me to worry about things, but it was so long ago, I can’t really worry about it retroactively.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her words brought him back to three years ago, tumbling around with Mittermeyer in the snow that was so cold that it squeaked underfoot, with air that froze the tears at the corners of the eyes and the moisture in the breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did he tell you about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head. “Not much. He just said that his base came under attack, and that he was very lucky you were close enough to come reinforce him before the main forces on the planet arrived.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t close,” Reuenthal said. “I was a day’s drive away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I had to go, because Ovelesser wasn’t going to send any reinforcements. He was going to leave him to die. I disobeyed the overall strategic plan to do it, and got a black mark on my record for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Her voice was high and thin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because he wasn’t worth the resources to the Imperial Fleet.” But he had been worth it to Reuenthal. “A half constructed mine, and a nobody commander with a single battalion of workers. Not worth committing anything to, until I forced their hand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He should have told me so that I could thank you myself,” Evangeline said. “I’m very grateful that you are Wolf’s friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal didn’t say anything for a second. He could see Mittermeyer coming back through the crowd, drinks in hand. “You should tell your husband to stop keeping secrets from you,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Evangeline’s face twisted like she had been hit, Mittermeyer made it back over. Reuenthal took the offered wine from his hand. “Thanks,” he said. “I think I’ll take a walk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I—” Mittermeyer began, but Reuenthal was already gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He left the two of them with some relief, and headed through the crowded sides of the party, listening to chatter and pushing his way through the crowd. He had a vague intention of trying to get closer to Ovelesser and Muckenburger, just to give him something to do at this party other than stand next to Mittermeyer. Unfortunately, by the time that he made it up to the front of the room, Ovelesser and Muckenburger had gone their separate ways. Ovelesser was standing by one of the refreshment tables and filling a glass with ice cubes, which he then proceeded to eat one by one. Muckenburger had vanished. But it wouldn’t have been useful following him anyway— Reuenthal knew he was smart enough to keep his mouth shut. It was only Ovelesser who might have been tempted to say something in anger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But now Reuenthal was standing at the front of the room, looking around like a hawk at everyone for no reason. His eyes settled on the table where Prime Minister Lichtenlade was sitting, along with a bunch of other nobles. They clearly weren’t military, and more than half of them were women, most of them with the same shade of blonde hair— it must be a group of his extended relatives. Most of them were talking and eating quite pleasantly, but there was one young woman— probably in her mid twenties— who was staring out at the party with a glare that could have frozen water into ice. As Reuenthal’s gaze roved across the table, he couldn’t help but smirk at her miserable expression. But, as he did so, her eyes landed on him, and he was caught in her death glare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had nothing to do with him, so it wasn’t losing face to turn away and leave that area of the party to go look at other guests.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal wandered around alone for a little while. There were some people he knew, or at least recognized, aside from Mittermeyer, but he wasn’t in the mood for socializing, and kept checking the time to see when he would be allowed to leave the event. He caught the occasional glimpse of Mittermeyer across the room, who was introducing his wife to various people he happened to know. Evangeline was smiling and laughing, and this made Reuenthal lose interest in going back over to rejoin him. He ended up standing near one of the tall glass windows, looking out over a snowy garden, and drinking another glass of wine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had lost his supposed interest in eavesdropping on the other guests at the party, and he had also lost some of his situational awareness. So, when he heard someone’s voice directly behind him, he didn’t register that he was being addressed until she spoke his name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You must be the one I was told to find, Rear Admiral Reuenthal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal turned on his heel. There was the woman who had been sitting at the Lichtenlade table, standing a few feet from him, tilting her head to the side. She had long, blonde hair and was shorter than he was by a fair amount. Although she was slim and didn’t look like she would present much of a danger to anyone, her eyes were cold and hard, ice blue. It was this open meanness that gave him pause. She was wearing an emerald green dress that contrasted with her blood red lipstick, and her tongue flicked out to lick her lips as she waited for Reuenthal to answer her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume the Baroness Westpfale told you to hunt me down,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did she tell you to find me? I saw you were staring, earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reuenthal said. “She told me someone would be looking for me, but she refused to say who. I suppose because you are a member of the Lichtenlade clan, she thought I would be prejudiced against you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hah.” The woman laughed, but it was a cold sound. “And why would that be, Herr Reuenthal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unless something changes over the next few months, it seems like I’m destined to be your enemy, or at least your family’s.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then let’s be enemies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was told not to make any new ones at this party.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a pity.” She glanced behind herself at the table where her family sat. One of the older women was watching her every move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you say that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baroness Westpfale said— and if I’m wrong, please do not take this the wrong way— that you and I are very similar people. She has told me in the past that I am not capable of holding any warm feeling in my heart other than the heat of anger.” She smiled. “If I’m incapable of a warm love, a burning hatred will have to satisfy me. And I’ve been very bored, recently. If you want to be my enemy, it might make things more exciting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stared at her, and she met his eyes without flinching. “Let me get you a drink.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Poison, if you want to prove your best intentions,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His lips curled, and he headed off to the bar to go get her something. He glanced behind himself as he went, and saw her lean against the windowsill, watching him watch her. At the bar, he procured drinks for both of them— there was a nasty cinnamon flavored bottle of spirits that the bartender was putting into eggnog as a holiday drink, but Reuenthal asked for it straight. Drink acquired, he went back to her at the window and held out one of the glasses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To warm your heart,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take the other, thank you,” she said, and reached for the glass in his right hand instead of the one he was offering.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you wanted poison,” he said, but let her have it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What kind of enemy of yours would I be if I didn’t also try to make you drink poison?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve poisoned both glasses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She lifted hers to her lips, smiled, and knocked it back at once, not flinching even a little. Reuenthal drank his just as fast. It burned on the way down, cinnamon and high proof alcohol. It tasted disgusting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Delicious,” she said. “Invigorating. Let’s dance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You like dancing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very much so,” she said. She grabbed his arm, and pulled him towards the dance floor. He went willingly, but she seemed nervous about something, her fingers digging into his arm. He saw what it was immediately: one of the women who had been sitting next to her at the Lichtenlade table had gotten up and was walking purposefully towards them. To avoid this encroaching presence, she flung herself into Reuenthal’s arms, and they hid themselves among the swirling, seething mass of dancers, becoming one with the motion of the crowd. The first song they danced to was bright and fast— heavy on the horns from the band at the front— and there was a prescribed dance that went along with it, one that Reuenthal had to search the depths of his memory to find the steps to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was a very good dancer, but the nervousness didn’t leave her, even as they moved body to body. When they turned, she would whip her neck around like a ballerina, but she was scanning the crowd, and at times would try to take the leading step in the dance to move them both further into the room. This annoyed Reuenthal, and instead of letting her, he gripped her more tightly, feeling the thin strings of muscle move beneath her skin. She stopped trying to move after that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know the baroness?” he asked as the song changed to something that would allow for conversation, a slower dance that pushed them more tightly together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We went to school together,” she said. “And you, how do you know her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I’ll tell you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have to assume that you’re a jilted lover, then. Now that she’s marrying someone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And she’s trying to set me up with a replacement? Does that seem like something she would do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. She loves to play that kind of game with people. The only problem comes when she learns that she’s not the only one capable of playing it. And that the rules aren’t ones that she gets to write herself.” Even as she spoke, she kept her eyes on the side of the crowd. When she flinched, Reuenthal too glanced at the woman who was trying to push through the crowd towards them, and spun them through into the deepest mass of swirling dresses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For a friend of hers, you have a low opinion of her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s because she’s not my friend,” the woman said, rather viciously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is she to you, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I’ll tell you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell me, or I’ll stop dancing with you. Your family can have you back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you want to know?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I want to know why the baroness was so insistent that we meet each other. What could we possibly have to gain— or what could she have to gain?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She owes me,” the woman said. “This is for my sake. Though I’m sure she has her reasons for choosing you, rather than some other man she knows. Gods know she’s familiar with plenty of men.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I have to be a man, for whatever scheme is going on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what is it that you want, here? What’s your goal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to win.” She stared into his eyes as she said this, and he didn’t doubt that she was telling the truth. But they turned, and he could see the older woman on the edge of the crowd, her expression cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what will happen to you if you lose?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going to answer that question,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was unfortunate that this was her answer, because the song ended at that moment, and Reuenthal dropped his hands and released her. She tried to grab him again, to keep dancing, but he said, “You should have answered my questions. Too bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He started to walk off the dance floor, and she followed him. “Wait—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it was too late. The woman who had been watching from the sidelines came up to the both of them, as soon as they left the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Efriede,” the older woman said, “what are you doing?” Her glare had fallen away, replaced with a concerned, motherly impression. It was vaguely sickening, to contrast with the former expression. She stepped towards Elfriede controllingly, but the hand she laid on her arm was feather light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede’s whole manner changed. She made her tone light, and her smile sickly. “I’m dancing, mama.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“With what gentleman?” the older woman asked, turning to Reuenthal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One who’s leaving,” Reuenthal said. “Goodnight, Fraulein.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He left, but as soon as he was far enough away that he didn’t think anyone was watching him, he turned back to look at Elfriede and her older relative. Elfriede’s face had twisted into something bitter, and her mother— Reuenthal had to assume it was her mother— was digging her nails into her arm and pulling her away, back towards their family table. As she was dragged along, she turned her head like an owl, scanning the crowd, and she looked directly at Reuenthal, bitter anger in her gaze. Reuenthal cocked his head to the side. What was she going to do to him? He deliberately turned away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal got himself another drink. He was tempted to go find Mittermeyer again, but then he spotted him, dancing with his wife. He leaned against the window and watched them, drinking his wine and speaking to no one. They wove into and out of sight, just like every other pair of dancers, and Reuenthal stared, and stared. He doubted that Mittermeyer saw him— he wasn’t as observant of these things as Reuenthal tended to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He spared an occasional glance at the Lichtenlade table. Just as he was watching the Mittermeyers, Elfriede was watching him, with just as cold an expression on her face. On his fifth drink, not sure what he was motivated by other than drunkenness, he raised his glass to her across the room. She had no response. He downed his drink, and then decided that he couldn’t bear to be at this party any longer, even if the alcohol was free.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He left, but he stopped in one of the bathrooms first. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Beyond the noise and heat of the party, he was suddenly cognizant of the ringing in his ears from the sudden cessation of noise— the faint strains of music and sounds of voices still carrying through the dark and empty hallway of Neue Sanssouci, but they were difficult to hear over the buzzing in his head— and the sweat that suddenly cooled on his forehead from leaving the sweltering crowd. He was drunker than he thought, too, and he swayed on his feet as he shoved open the bathroom door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was blessedly empty, and he was washing his hands and staring into his reflection when he heard the door open behind him. He caught a glimpse of emerald green in the glass, and he turned to find Elfriede right behind him, her disdainful gaze roaming over the urinals.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t give up that easily.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you followed me into the bathroom? You must be particularly stupid, or trusting, or lack some aspect of self-preservation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what my mother says.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you should listen to her and develop one,” he replied. “Get out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal took a step towards her. “You’ve made a fundamental error: you don’t want me anywhere near you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t flinch at all, and she stared directly into his eyes. “You aren’t going to hurt me,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Saying something like that would make a lesser man want to try.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s the goal,” she said. “The only way you could hurt me is by ignoring me. And I won’t let you do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you think that you’re going to get whatever it is that you want out of me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie told me that you have a house,” she said, changing the subject completely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what else did she tell you about me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That you were my ticket, that I could get you to do whatever I needed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what gave her that impression. It’s a wrong one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede reached out towards him. He wasn’t sure what she was trying to do, but he grabbed her wrist, yanking it upwards so that she was forced to step towards him, close enough that he could feel the heat of her body and smell her perfume— something musky and vaguely masculine. He had pinned himself against the sink onthe other side,and she bore down on him, leaning forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want something from me, too,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want anything from you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But his body betrayed him as her other hand crept between his legs, tracing its way up towards his belt. He was too drunk to think properly. He should have pushed her away, but instead he grabbed her chin, his grip far too strong, maybe even enough to bruise. He tilted her head up to face him, and pressed his thumb against her lips, smearing her lipstick. Her breath came out through her teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She said that you wanted someone to hate.” Now she was breathing rapidly. “You can hate me. But I need to get out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want to be hated?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She opened her mouth enough to bare her teeth, and Reuenthal let go of her chin to slip two fingers inside her mouth. She tried to bite him, but he hooked them into the soft flesh of her cheek and pulled, making her beautiful face twist into something ugly by his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s better to be hated than ignored,” she said, garbled past his fingers. Her roving hand had made it past his belt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not here,” he said, and pulled his fingers out of her mouth with a wet pop. “Your mother knows we were talking. She’ll know where you went.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But she won’t be able to hold me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And she smiled, knowing that she had won.</span>

  <em>Mittermeyer</em>
</p><p>
  <em>April 488 I.C., Odin </em>
</p><p>It never ceased to be strange to invite a baroness, and now a count, over for dinner at his flat, but Mittermeyer found that Yang and Magdalena were quite natural in the small and cozy space. Magdalena was relentlessly charming, even if she was overdressed for the casual gathering, and Yang was all gentle smiles; he had a way of looking at Mittermeyer, catching his eye, and putting him instantly at ease. That was just the way that Yang had always been.</p><p>The dinner conversation was lively, with Magdalena tugging everyone else along with her in her boundless enthusiasm for discussing plans: what the weather forecast was for the day of the wedding, the bachelorette party that Eva was throwing for her at the end of the week, and her plans for her honeymoon with Yang. Mittermeyer, even if he had wanted to contribute, couldn’t have gotten a word in edgewise. But this, he had come to understand, was still Magdalena on her best behavior. She kept on her best behavior because she was enamored with his wife, and so she designed the conversation around engaging and amusing her, rather than the men at the table. Yang didn’t seem to mind— when he finished eating, he propped his hands on his chin and just smiled and let Magdalena’s talk wash over him.</p><p>“Now, you have to tell me, Eva, and be honest,” Magdalena said, “do you think I’m going to enjoy married life?” Yang’s eyebrows twitched in concern, but there was no edge in the question that Mittermeyer could detect, and Magdalena’s cheeky smile stayed plastered to her face. Yang was probably better at reading Magdalena’s capricious moods than anyone else, though— there must have been some invisible signal she was giving off.</p><p>Eva giggled, helped by her second glass of wine. “You wouldn’t have agreed to get married if you didn’t think you would,” she pointed out.</p><p>“Well, one often finds that there’s a mismatch between expectations and reality! Come on, tell me, do you think I’ll enjoy it?”</p><p>“Yes, of course I do,” Eva said. “I think you’ll be very happy. And Hank, too.”</p><p>“Why do you think that?” Magdalena asked. “Really— I want to know.” She, too, was a little drunk, and while her tone remained light, her sincerity made her lean forward on the table and look Eva intently in the eyes.</p><p>“Well, I don’t know,” she began. Eva was clearly flustered. “But Hank is, you know, very kind, and honest, and he is handsome.” She glanced at Mittermeyer, with her sweet smile. “You don’t mind me saying so, I hope, darling?”</p><p>Mittermeyer laughed. “No, of course not. You’d be doing Leigh a disservice by saying he’s <em> not </em> handsome.” </p><p>This caused Yang to redden, carefully not looking at Mittermeyer. “You don’t need to tease me,” he said. “And none of those things means anything…” He trailed off into mumbles, and rubbed at the back of his head.</p><p>“I think they mean quite a lot,” Mittermeyer said quietly. Yang did look up at him then, and his awkwardness fell away as he met Mittermeyer’s eyes.</p><p>“Yes,” Eva said, “they really do. You and Wolf are very similar, in that way.” She tilted her head with a smile. “I’m very happy to be married to Wolf, and I’d never want a different husband, but if things had somehow turned out differently, I’m sure I would have been very happy to marry Hank instead.”</p><p>“And I would get to marry Wolf?” Magdalena asked with a silly, gleeful trill. She turned to him. “Oh, <em> darling </em>!” And she comically leaned towards him and clutched at his arm, making everyone laugh. “Too bad you’re already taken, when you’re the only man I know who isn’t a scoundrel, I’m told.”</p><p>“You’ll have your own husband, so you’ll have to keep your hands off mine,” Eva said with a giggle.</p><p>“Hmm, well, I would be happy to share Hank with you, if you like him so much,” Magdalena said with a wicked grin. “It’s only fair.”</p><p>Yang buried his face in his hands. “Maggie…”</p><p>“What?” she asked, a cheeky smile plastered to her face.</p><p>“I believe at one point you said that he could only handle one woman,” Mittermeyer teased. “Or have you changed your mind about that, recently?”</p><p>“Hm…” Magdalena said. “You’re right. I suppose I should be lucky to marry a one-woman man.”</p><p>Eva shook her head indulgently and got up to start clearing the dishes away. Mittermeyer hastened to help her. Magdalena wandered into the living room and began fiddling with the sound system, causing the strain of some unfamiliar orchestra to fill the air.</p><p>“This is the band I hired for the wedding,” she called. “Nice, isn’t it?”</p><p>“I don’t know the first thing about music, I’m afraid,” Mittermeyer replied.</p><p>“All you soldiers are so uncultured!”</p><p>“I think it’s very nice,” Eva said. They finished gathering all the dishes from the table, and went out to the living room, where they found that Magdalena was forcing Yang to dance with her, though there was very little room for them to do so, between the coffee table and the TV stand. Yang kept glancing behind himself nervously, afraid that Magdalena was going to make him trip over some furniture if he didn’t keep track of it all. He gave Mittermeyer a relieved smile when he appeared in the doorway, because this caused Magdalena to spin around one last time, then let go with a laugh.</p><p>“Eva, darling, let’s go to the <em> boudoir </em>— I want to show you how to do your hair with the little circlet I got you.”</p><p>“You don’t mind us abandoning you?” Eva asked Mittermeyer.</p><p>“Of course he doesn’t mind,” Magdalena said dismissively. “He’s happy to spend time talking with Hank about whatever it is husbands talk about when their wives aren’t in the room.”</p><p>“You’re not his wife yet!” Eva pointed out</p><p>“Close enough. Come on, darling.”</p><p>Eva flashed Mittermeyer an apologetic smile, and he gave her a genuine one back, letting her leave. This left Yang and Mittermeyer alone, with the music still playing loudly enough to cover up any conversation that could otherwise travel between closed doors. Mittermeyer couldn’t quite make up his mind on if Magdalena was a cruel genius or a kind one.</p><p>“You still don’t like dancing, I see,” Mittermeyer said. There was a small bar cart tucked into the corner of the room, half hidden behind some potted ferns, and Mittermeyer fixed drinks for both of them.</p><p>“No matter how much I practice, I don’t think I’ll ever get good at it. I just let Maggie push me around.” But he was smiling as he said it, and he accepted his drink from Mittermeyer with thanks. </p><p>They sat down on the couch together, very companionable, shoulder to shoulder. Yang was different than Reuenthal in that respect— had Reuenthal been here, he would have been unable to resist taking advantage of the moment, even with Eva just in the next room. But Yang was peaceful and content, and Mittermeyer knew he wouldn’t disturb the sanctity of Mittermeyer’s house unless he invited him to.</p><p>“How long do you think they’ll be in there?” Mittermeyer asked.</p><p>“I’m sure it won’t take less than an hour,” Yang replied. “I know as soon as they’re finished with hair, Maggie will make her show off her dress… You know how it is.” Magdalena was a kind genius, was what Yang was attempting to say.</p><p>Mittermeyer nodded and sipped at his drink, just listening to the music. Yang did the same.</p><p>“You’re very quiet tonight,” Mittermeyer pointed out after a while. “Something on your mind?”</p><p>“The things that aren’t on my mind would be a shorter list.”</p><p>“Is there something specific?”</p><p>Yang looked down into his glass. “Not really. I was just thinking about your wedding, I guess.”</p><p>“What about it?” He couldn’t help but be wary, though Yang would never be malicious in bringing it up— he clearly only was mentioning it because he was pressed, and he was an honest man.</p><p>“It’s nothing important,” he said hastily. “You just reminded me, when you asked about if I liked dancing— at your wedding I said that you would never have to dance with me.” There was an audible melancholy in his voice, one that belied that he had been thinking about this topic more than his casual phrasing would suggest. He shook his head. “That’s all I’m thinking about— I’m being silly.”</p><p>Mittermeyer looked at him for a moment, Yang’s eyes skating away from his, a flush on his cheeks that couldn’t quite be attributed to alcohol. Mittermeyer looked behind himself at the closed bedroom door into which Magdalena and Eva had disappeared, then put his drink down on the coffee table and stood, offering his hand to Yang. He looked up at him with wide eyes before taking it, and Mittermeyer gently tugged him to his feet and into the small center of the room, on the worn braided rug.</p><p>Yang was a nervous person in some ways, so Mittermeyer moved slowly as he put his hand on Yang’s waist, stepping very close to him. Yang didn’t say anything, but over the gentle music, Mittermeyer could hear the hitch-change in his breathing, shallow and fluttering. He pulled Yang against him, and Yang leaned his head on Mittermeyer’s shoulder, his soft hair tickling his neck.</p><p>He had expected that dancing with Yang would be pleasant, but it was so much nicer than he had expected, to have Yang’s warm body against his, pliant as Mittermeyer shuffled him around in a simple four step square. It could hardly even be considered dancing, but that didn’t matter. It was perfect for what it was. With Yang, Mittermeyer didn’t find himself missing the urgency that so much else in his life demanded from him.</p><p>But the song eventually ended. Yang lifted his head off of Mittermeyer’s shoulder to look at him. Yang’s eyes glittered— the darkness of space, with stars in it— maybe it was the light, and maybe it was something else. </p><p>“Thank you,” Yang said. He touched Mittermeyer’s cheek, so lightly that his fingertips barely grazed Mittermeyer’s skin, and tickled the day’s worth of growth of his beard. He wasn’t asking for anything, but Mittermeyer kissed him anyway, and pulled him back down to the couch. Yang’s body melted against him, not at all urgent, but welcoming Mittermeyer’s touch.</p><p>It was dangerous to kiss on the couch, and Mittermeyer positioned himself so that he could see the door of the bedroom. He had never had any self control when it came to this, which made him feel guilty, even as Yang seemed to be doing his best to push every thought out of Mittermeyer’s head— stroking his hair, leaning heavily against him, kissing him with a mouth that still tasted like alcohol.</p><p>They continued like this for a while, until Yang pulled away. Mittermeyer wondered why, and then he realized that while he had been paying attention to how Yang’s body felt soft under his hands, Yang’s hand traveling down his arm and side must have felt how he was tensing every muscle in his body at once— the strain of holding the guilt and pleasure of the moment in balance. Yang smiled at him, and Mittermeyer tried to relax.</p><p>“I should ask what’s on your mind,” Yang said.</p><p>“You already know the answer.” He missed Yang’s touch as soon as he no longer had it, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to ask for it back. Yang saw the still-wanting look in Mittermeyer’s eyes, and while he didn’t kiss him again, he curled up on the couch, and let his head rest in Mittermeyer’s lap. Mittermeyer ran his fingers through Yang’s hair.</p><p>“I’m jealous of you, you know,” Mittermeyer said after some time.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Yang murmured.</p><p>“No, don’t apologize.” He kept playing with Yang’s hair. “You just have a very good way of making me aware of how life could be. You always have.”</p><p>Yang was silent.</p><p>“Should I tell Eva?”</p><p>“She would forgive you, if you did.”</p><p>Mittermeyer knew that this was true— Yang wouldn’t lie to him, and he knew Eva very well. She was a forgiving person, and better than he was. But he didn’t want to be the kind of person who needed to be forgiven. It was worse to keep her in the dark, but her knowing would change the way she saw him, make him into something difficult and complicated. It would hurt her, to know that her husband was not an honest man.</p><p>He had spent years thinking about this, and had never come to a conclusion, and he doubted that he was going to now. But he let his fingers drift through Yang’s hair, and this eased some of his tension, even as the thoughts continued to pass on their circular journey through his mind. He realized, after some time, that Yang had fallen asleep.</p><p>Although he really should get Yang’s head off his lap, he didn’t want to move. Perhaps he was testing himself. So, when Magdalena and Eva emerged from the bedroom, with Eva’s hair coiled up delicately around a flowery circlet, Yang was still curled up and snoring and using him as a pillow. Mittermeyer was looking at his phone and pretending to be nonchalant.</p><p>Evangeline smiled at the both of them.</p><p>“You must not be letting your fiance get enough sleep,” Mittermeyer said to Magdalena. “He passed out on top of me.”</p><p>“No, I think it must be that you bored him to sleep,” Magdalena retorted. </p><p>The noise woke Yang up, and he jolted upright, his face beet red, and he looked at Mittermeyer in a momentary panic. “I’m so sorry, I must have fallen asleep— I didn’t mean to— on you.” He was still half incoherent in his return to consciousness.</p><p>“It’s fine, Leigh,” Mittermeyer said. “If it bothered me, I would have woken you up.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em> Reuenthal </em>
</p><p>Why he had been convinced to come here tonight, Reuenthal couldn’t explain. The bar that Yang’s bachelor party was being held at was upscale, and a far cry from most of the bars that Yang had preferred to frequent back in the days when he was teaching at the IOA. He was sure that Yang hadn’t picked it, even though it was his event. It must have been suggested to him by his fiancee, or even by someone like Duke Braunschweig. At least everyone else at the gathering seemed to appreciate the venue, probably due to the tab Yang had opened at the bar, on which everyone was putting their drinks.</p><p>Yang had not so much announced that he would pay for everyone as simply, in his usual unassuming way, let the information percolate, quietly enough that no one could protest or thank him. It had been over half a year since he had been made a count, and this was the first outlay of his money that Reuenthal had even seen. Yang’s lifestyle, such as it was, hardly seemed to have changed in the interim. This was the subject of no small amount of derision from Elfriede, when Reuenthal happened to mention it. But he had fallen out of the habit of mentioning Yang to her, for that reason, and others.</p><p>Elfriede wasn’t in the bar tonight, of course, since it was Yang’s bachelor party. There was Mittermeyer, who seemed completely unencumbered by the world, laughing and joking with Bittenfeld and Wahlen. Bittenfeld had arranged his leave specifically to see Yang married, and had come back to Odin from some distant frontier resupply duty. He was a captain these days, and therefore in charge of a whole squad of ships, but he complained endlessly about how dull supply runs were. Wahlen, on the other hand, had made it to commodore, and was on an extended personal leave already due to the birth of his son. He showed everyone who would give him the opportunity pictures of the extremely rotund, bald baby and the tiny wife he had apparently emerged from. </p><p>Eisenach, who also remained a captain (and probably would for the rest of all time, unless someone decided that a flag officer who refused to give verbal orders was a thing that the Imperial Fleet could suffer to have), was playing darts with Yang’s red-headed eavesdropping protege, Lieutenant Kircheis. It seemed that the lowest-ranked person at the party had decided that the silent captain was the safest avenue for socialization.</p><p>After a little while spent speaking with people in obligatory greeting, Reuenthal was sitting at the bar, drinking a whiskey. He wasn’t quite alone: Yang’s friend Oberstein, the dour looking captain with prematurely gray hair, sat a seat away from him with a flagon of beer in front of him that never seemed to get any emptier. It seemed they had both received pity invitations to the party.</p><p>When Bittenfeld roared out, “You invited WHO?” Reuenthal looked over at Yang, over at the pool table, who waved his hands in a conciliatory manner.</p><p>“Well he said he didn’t want to come, so it’s a moot point anyway!”</p><p>“Leigh, you have a saintly ability to forgive, I think,” Wahlen said. “I’m willing to take your lead, but I remember when we graduated— I’m glad Ansbach had the sense to stay away, so he doesn’t accidentally repeat that infamous fight at Josef’s.”</p><p>“We’re not at Josef’s,” Yang pointed out.</p><p>“Yeah, this place is much classier. It would make a much funnier image for me to toss him over a table,” Bittenfeld said.</p><p>“Ansbach is fine,” Yang stressed. “Isn’t he, Kircheis?”</p><p>Kircheis, startled at being summoned, missed his dart in the game, and it thunked into the wall outside the board, causing Eisenach to shake his head and go retrieve it. “Er, yes, sir,” Kircheis said, though he sounded more like he was trying to preserve some kind of peace than he had any real convictions.</p><p>“I’ll believe that when I see it,” Mittermeyer said.</p><p>“Well, he’s coming to the wedding,” Yang said. “So I guess I’m glad I warned you all. He really is fine, though.”</p><p>“If you say so,” Wahlen said.</p><p>“Look— if you made me choose between Ansbach and Baron Flegel—” Yang said.</p><p>“Well if THAT’S the kind of choice that you have, no wonder,” Bittenfeld said. “Like a drink of piss in the desert.” Presumably, Yang had complained about Duke Braunschweig’s extended family in his letters to Bittenfeld as much as he had to Reuenthal.</p><p>“Your talent for metaphor has greatly improved since I last saw you,” Yang said dryly.</p><p>“Thank you,” Bittenfeld said with a comical bow.</p><p>Reuenthal shook his head and turned back to his drink. He drank in silence for a while. It was easy enough to listen to the chatter of his old friends, the ambiance of the bar outside their small circle. It neither soothed nor discomforted him. He could feel Yang’s occasional glances in his direction, but he seemed to have decided that truly disturbing Reuenthal would be unwise. Was he right? Reuenthal didn’t know.</p><p>Yang ended up dragged into a poker game with Eisenach, Bittenfeld, Wahlen, and Mittermeyer. Wahlen tried to wave Reuenthal over to join, but Reuenthal just raised his drink in a toast and shook his head. He remained at the bar, and was unfortunately joined by Lieutenant Kircheis, who sat down near him and got a beer.</p><p>“No interest in poker, Lieutenant?” Reuenthal asked.</p><p>Kircheis seemed surprised to be addressed. “Commodore Leigh would feel very bad if he won money from me, and he’d spend the next week trying to pay me back,” Kircheis said. “It’s better if I bow out before the game begins.”</p><p>“So, just convinced you’d lose.”</p><p>“It’s a game of chance, sir. There’s a chance I’d lose, no matter how well I played my hand.”</p><p>“The lieutenant is right,” Oberstein said. He had been listening to their brief conversation, and paying attention to the goings-on at the party just as much as Reuenthal had. “Strategy is about playing hands you know you can win.”</p><p>“You count cards, Oberstein?” Reuenthal asked. Thinking about it, it wouldn’t surprise him if Oberstein could see through the cards, with his mechanical eyes.</p><p>“I’m not a gambler.”</p><p>“You and Lieutenant Kircheis have met before, I assume?”</p><p>“Yes. On Iserlohn,” Oberstein said. “It’s rare that all of Commodore Leigh’s close friends are together on Odin.”</p><p>“I’m sure he apologized profusely to you for costing you your Iserlohn post.”</p><p>“It’s no matter,” Oberstein said. “I knew that it was a matter of time. There are other posts.”</p><p>“What are you doing on Odin, sir?” Kircheis asked.</p><p>“Actuarial duty,” Oberstein replied dryly.</p><p>“And I’ve been moved to the budget office,” Reuenthal said. “It’s interesting that Fleet Admiral Muckenburger considers hands on the purse strings to have no power.”</p><p>“When the Kaiser dies, Braunschweig’s fleet will continue to fund itself on his planets’ revenues, and what he’s managed to stash away for this occasion. There isn’t time for meaningful change in the movement of money to make a difference, at this point. If you had been assigned there five years ago, there would have been time, and reason.”</p><p>“You speak so openly of defrauding His Majesty’s fleet, Captain Oberstein.”</p><p>“Defrauding? No. There would have been ways to move money that no one could have called improper. Funding one fleet while disbanding others for budgetary reasons. Unless you would have thought to directly enrich yourself?”</p><p>Reuenthal laughed darkly. “There are plenty of men who would.”</p><p>“Where is Rear Admiral Mittermeyer assigned on Odin?” Kircheis asked, clearly wanting to break the tension.</p><p>“The research division, under Admiral Schaft,” Reuenthal said. “Another miserable engineering post, in a department that’s produced nothing of worth in years.”</p><p>“They came up with directed zephyr particles,” Kircheis pointed out.</p><p>“An innovation that was promptly conveyed to the rebel fleet, before anyone even had a chance to get a tactical advantage out of it,” Reuenthal said.</p><p>“True,” Kircheis said.</p><p>“It’s an interim position, anyway. He won’t be in it for long. And the same for myself in the budget office, and Oberstein, fixing the fleet’s accounts. You and Leigh are very lucky that you have a permanent place.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said, though he didn’t sound so sure.</p><p>“You don’t like working for Duke Braunschweig?”</p><p>Kircheis hesitated, then said, “It’s not Duke Braunschweig I’m working for.”</p><p>“You should be careful, Lieutenant,” Reuenthal said. “Dangerous talk.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said.</p><p>Reuenthal wasn’t sure if he should pity Kircheis or not. Yang clearly trusted him and liked him, enough to invite him to this party, anyway. But the distance between them was so large— even if Yang wanted to ignore it, it was the kind of thing that Kircheis had to be hyper aware of. Before he could poke at Kircheis’s feelings towards Yang as a superior, Oberstein spoke up in his nasally voice, saving Kircheis from Reuenthal’s cross-examination.</p><p>“Commodore Leigh has a unique talent for gathering loyal friends,” he said.</p><p>“And in such great numbers,” Reuenthal said, sarcasm in his voice, though it wasn’t exactly fair. Yang had plenty of contacts who weren’t invited to the small party— Count Mariendorf, his spy on Phezzan, surely more who Reuenthal didn’t know about.</p><p>“Perhaps not,” Oberstein said. “But he is well positioned, and a small group is easier to coordinate, when the time comes.”</p><p>“Are you trying to ask who here is loyal enough to Leigh?” Reuenthal asked. “I’m the wrong person to get that information out of.”</p><p>“No,” Oberstein said. “I’m already well aware of where people’s loyalties fall.”</p><p>“It’s for the best that Commodore Ansbach declined his invitation tonight. It would be unwise to talk about all of this with him in the room,” Reuenthal said.</p><p>“Would it be?” Oberstein asked. “I expect that in the near future, some of us here on Odin will need to sit down and coordinate.”</p><p>“Coordinate what, precisely?” Reuenthal asked, though he was being intentionally obtuse just to poke Oberstein into talking more. “As we’ve already discussed, I have no power here on Odin. I don’t have a single troop under my command.”</p><p>“Neither does Duke Braunschweig, at this moment,” Oberstein said. “All of his men are held on his estates and areas under his control. Muckenburger would never give him, or any other noble like him, permission to stage his personal troops in the capital. But when they arrive,  it will be a different story. I’m certain Lieutenant Kircheis could tell us if Commodore Leigh has plans prepared.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Captain, I can’t speak to that,” Kircheis said. He had been listening intently, but was clearly not the type to speak unless spoken to.</p><p>“Of course not,” Oberstein said. “One thing that you should be aware of, if you aren’t already, is that Duke Braunschweig is at a disadvantage in the capital. Marquis Littenheim has hands and eyes in the military police.”</p><p>“And how do you know this?”</p><p>Oberstein didn’t answer the question. “Keeping them occupied during key moments, so that they can’t interfere with any of Braunschweig’s plans, may be a task that will be left to someone who remains on Odin.”</p><p>“We’ll see,” Reuenthal said. </p><p>There was a cheer from Bittenfeld at the card table, and Wahlen grumbled as he shoved the pot of money towards him. Reuenthal finished his drink, then stood. “This isn’t the time or place to discuss it.” </p><p>He couldn’t quite put his finger on why Oberstein grated on him so much, but he did. Perhaps it was just jealousy— the kind of feeling that was lurking on the edges of this entire party. Jealous that Yang would marry someone. Jealous that Yang would trust anyone other than himself, especially a man like Oberstein, who had come out of nowhere to enter Yang’s life. Reuenthal could identify that emotion easily enough, and it was easy to admit it to himself, but that didn’t mean he could do anything about it.</p><p>Since the first round of poker had ended, Reuenthal went over to their table. “Deal me in,” he said, and pulled up a chair to squeeze in between Yang and Eisenach, who was dealing.</p><p>Yang smiled at him, a real, genuine smile, and scooted his chair over to make room. </p><p>“Glad you could join us, Reuenthal,” Bittenfeld said. “I’m looking forward to clearing you out, too.”</p><p>“You just got lucky,” Wahlen said. “It had to happen someday.”</p><p>Bittenfeld’s usual strategy at poker, Reuenthal remembered, was holding onto his cards for an unreasonably long amount of time, and never folding, regardless of what he actually happened to have in his hand. It was pretty easy to beat him, but it was also impossible to tell what kind of hand he was holding.</p><p>Eisenach dealt him in, and Reuenthal pulled a few single mark coins from his pockets to toss into the pot.</p><p>“So, Reuenthal, I hear you’ve got a girl now,” Bittenfeld said as he peered at his cards. “How’s that working out for you?”</p><p>“Fine,” Reuenthal said shortly. He lifted the edge of his cards up from the table so that he could see his own hand. Two queens.</p><p>“What’s she like? Mittermeyer says she’s living in your house. I didn’t know you were the type of guy to do a thing like that.”</p><p>“Oh?” Reuenthal said. “I wasn’t aware I had a good reputation to ruin.”</p><p>Bittenfeld laughed. “Well, come on, tell us about her. At least her name.”</p><p>“Elfriede von Kohlrausch."</p><p>“Kohlrausch… Never heard of her.”</p><p>“Minor nobility,” Reuenthal said. “Her father was the second brother of a baron.”</p><p>“So, what is she doing living in your house?”</p><p>“What do you think she’s doing living in my house, Bittenfeld?”</p><p>Bittenfeld snorted with laughter, and elbowed Mittermeyer in the ribs. “I remember— I told Mittermeyer we should have gone to a strip club for his bachelor party. But now we’ve lost the opportunity, since half of you are respectably married now, and you’ve already got something unrespectable going on at home.” Bittenfeld craned his neck to shout over at Kircheis and Oberstein. “Hey! When we get out of here, all of us who still don’t have wives should go have some real fun!”</p><p>“Er, I’m good, thank you, sir,” Kircheis said, looking up from whatever conversation he was having with Oberstein. </p><p>“Leave Kircheis alone,” Yang said with a laugh. “He doesn’t need your bad influence.”</p><p>“Only yours,” Reuenthal said.</p><p>“There are worse influences for a person to have,” Mittermeyer said.</p><p>Eisenach turned over the three cards in front of him. There was a king on the table, along with a seven and a two. Reuenthal looked around, trying to determine who might have a better hand than his pair. He couldn’t tell, but since a pair of queens was a fairly high pair, he decided to stay in. If anyone had a king in their hand, he would be beaten, but nobody gave any indications, aside from Wahlen folding immediately, which caused Bittenfeld to boo him.</p><p>“My hand was awful,” Wahlen protested. “I don’t need to lose all my spare change to you.”</p><p>“Spare change?” Bittenfeld scoffed as he pushed a significant chunk of his previous winnings back into the pot. Reuenthal sighed and got out his wallet to match Bittenfeld’s bet.</p><p>Yang, much more practical, looked like he wanted to fold, but Bittenfeld said, “You have money to spare, Leigh. If you fold because I’m pretending to be rich today—!”</p><p>“Fine, fine,” Yang said with a laugh, and put a few bills in the center of the table. </p><p>Mittermeyer tossed in his, too, with a cheerful grimace.</p><p>Eisenach raised an eyebrow, and then flipped over the next card— a second king. If anyone else had a king in their hands, Reuenthal was doomed, but how likely was that? Two in forty-six chance for each of the six cards in their hands. The odds added up.</p><p>Bittenfeld did not dump the rest of his money into the pot this time, and no one else around the table raised the ante either. This, to Reuenthal, seemed like Bittenfeld’s equivalent of folding. Yang was too cautious of a person to ever raise the stakes on his own, and Mittermeyer’s eyes bored into his across the table. Reuenthal smiled.</p><p>Eisenach flipped over the last card— a four.</p><p>Everyone revealed their hands. Reuenthal almost laughed when he saw Mittermeyer’s hand— he had the other two queens. “We tied,” he said.</p><p>“What are the odds?”</p><p>Bittenfeld scowled and pushed the pot towards Yang. Reuenthal finally looked over at his hand. Three sevens and two kings: a full house. </p><p>“You always manage to come out on top,” Reuenthal said.</p><p>Yang just shook his head and waved at the waitress to get everyone another round of beers. They played another few rounds. Yang did his best to lose the money he had just won, which annoyed Reuenthal to watch, so he eventually got up and went to stand on the balcony of the bar, a beer in hand. His departure made the game break up, and Bittenfeld dragged Kircheis into a game of pool, while Yang sat down with Oberstein, Eisenach, and Wahlen. Mittermeyer followed Reuenthal outside.</p><p>It was a cool night out, and clouds were covering the stars. It would rain soon, but it wasn’t raining yet.</p><p>“Thank you for coming,” Mittermeyer said to him as they leaned on the cold wrought-iron railing.</p><p>“I don’t know why you’re thanking me,” Reuenthal said. “It’s not your party.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Mittermeyer stared down at the street. There was throbbing music coming out of the first floor of the bar below them, and cars rushing too fast down the road. “I’m still glad, though. It’s good to get to see you.”</p><p>Reuenthal was tempted to ask if he was forgiven for not having gone to Mittermeyer’s wedding, years ago, but he knew that the answer was almost certainly yes (or, at least, Mittermeyer would say yes, which was a different thing). And he didn’t want to hear it, anyway. Instead, he just stayed silent.</p><p>“Are you bringing Fraulein Kohlrausch to the wedding tomorrow? I’d like to meet her,” Mittermeyer asked, breaking the silence.</p><p>“I don’t know why you do.”</p><p>“She’s clearly important to you. I hope you don’t think I resent that.”</p><p>“She’s not important.”</p><p>“I don’t know how you can say that when she’s been living with you for months.” The beer in his hands was tilted precariously over the sidewalk, threatening to spill on any passersby— he was a bit drunk. “And keeping you busy.”</p><p>“You’re always busy on Odin. I don’t think that’s changed in the least. It’s not me who’s busy.”</p><p>“But with her in your house, you don’t want anyone to come see you.” He sighed. “I assume she doesn’t know anything.”</p><p>Reuenthal barked out a laugh, which meant nothing. “She’ll come tomorrow.”</p><p>“Oh, good. I’m glad.”</p><p>They were silent again. Reuenthal thought about going back inside, but he was compelled to stay there with Mittermeyer, who was staring off into the distance, looking at the lights of the capital city.</p><p>“Is it wrong of me to be looking forward to all of this falling apart?” Mittermeyer asked after a while.</p><p>“Civil war, you mean?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Leigh would be a better person to answer that question than I am.”</p><p>“I know, that’s why I’m asking you. It would upset him.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter what you feel about it,” Reuenthal said. “It doesn’t matter what Leigh feels about it, either. It’s nothing that anybody could stop— not even the Kaiser, at this point. Even if he named an heir, that kid would just die sooner. The only person who could have stopped it was whoever murdered Prince Ludwig, years ago. If the assassin had been faced with a change of heart, and he hadn’t gone through with it.”</p><p>“Yeah.” This hadn’t been the answer Mittermeyer wanted.</p><p>“Why are you looking forward to it?”</p><p>He didn’t look at Reuenthal, and it took a moment for him to gather his thoughts. Reuenthal just waited. </p><p>“Everything keeps shifting around,” he said. “I keep picking things to say— oh, once this is done, everything will go back to normal.” He shook his head. “Coming back home from Barbarasturm, then getting out of my punishment duty at Iserlohn, getting back to Odin, Leigh’s wedding— and even, I don’t know, so many things before that I can’t even remember.”</p><p>Reuenthal could remember. He was sure that Mittermeyer had the same sensation concerning his own wedding, years ago. That was the reason he had gotten married in the first place.</p><p>Mittermeyer continued. “But everything just keeps happening, and afterwards it doesn’t feel like anything’s fixed or normal, and as soon as I get used to the status quo, there’s something else just looming out there.” He tilted his beer towards the darkness of the horizon, against which the city lights stood out, until they vanished under an oncoming curtain of rain. It was still far off in the distance, but it had begun to obscure the furthest lights.</p><p>“Anyway,” Mittermeyer said, “the thing about the war is— I can’t even imagine what’s on the other side of it. So I can’t build it up as this perfect place in the future where everything will be somehow, magically…” He trailed off and shook his head.</p><p>“You can’t? I’m surprised.”</p><p>“I mean, I can say ‘once it’s over, I’ll be happy’ but that’s not anything,” Mittermeyer said.</p><p>Perhaps Mittermeyer had cut to the difference between the two of them, though he didn’t realize it. He wouldn’t have been saying so much if he had seen it, cold and clear as day— though he was drunk, which made him talkative. </p><p>If there was something waiting out there, something Reuenthal could see coming but couldn’t control, standing in the threshold just waiting for some unspoken signal to enter— he never expected it to be something good on its way. All he could do was tense himself, brace himself to bear the brunt of the blow, whatever it was, and from whatever direction it came. </p><p>“I thought you were happy now,” Reuenthal said. “That’s the impression you give.”</p><p>“Is it?” He laughed. “I guess I’m glad I do.” He finished his beer, and looked forlornly into his glass, trying to summon more from the air. “I am happy, when I’m not thinking about it. When I’m in the moment. I guess it’s just hard to stay in the moment when there’s always something that’s coming. It’s easy to be happy. It’s harder to be content.”</p><p>That, Reuenthal could understand. And Mittermeyer was telling the truth— he always was happy in their snatched moments on Iserlohn, but when he started anticipating going on leave, it fell apart. He nodded silently.</p><p>“What about you, Oskar?” Mittemeyer asked.</p><p>“What about me?”</p><p>“Are you happy, these days?”</p><p>“Does it matter?”</p><p>“It matters to me.”</p><p>Reuenthal finished his drink, too. “If I say yes, or if I say no, it’s not going to change anything,” Reuenthal said. “It’s not something I think about.”</p><p>Mittermeyer looked at him with concern written in the furrow of his eyebrows. “Oskar—”</p><p>“I’m looking forward to the war, too,” Reuenthal said shortly. This satisfied Mittermeyer, who nodded. But Reuenthal was certain that he was anticipating it for other reasons than whatever Mittermeyer thought he meant. He could imagine a future with everything he wanted to see, the kinds of futures that swirled through his dreams— visions of Yang and Mittermeyer, and fire, and blood— but that wasn’t the anticipation that he felt in his waking moments. </p><p>It wasn’t dread. The feeling that was closest to his heart was one that he couldn’t express to anyone else— not even Yang or Mittermeyer. It was a feeling of wanting. Craving. Waiting to be tested, waiting for the blow to come, and wondering if he had prepared himself enough to endure it.</p><p>And yet, he didn’t want to get it over with. What if the moment before the blow landed could stretch on forever? What if the moment of being hit could last forever, too? Perhaps, unlike Mittermeyer, he was waiting for the storm to begin, but hoped that it would never end. Whatever Mittermeyer saw as beautiful on the other side disgusted him.</p><p>Reuenthal turned around, leaning against the railing with his elbows behind him. He could see into the bar, where Yang was also leaning against the bar itself, waiting for the bartender to finish mixing his drink. He was looking out the large, sliding glass doors onto the balcony, either looking at Reuenthal and Mittermeyer, or past them, at the clouds that were swiftly scuttling towards them on the horizon. He was startled when Reuenthal turned around, and their eyes met across the distance.</p><p>“I should go home,” Reuenthal said. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Mittermeyer.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was pouring rain when Reuenthal arrived home. His car headlights slashed through the haze and illuminated the walls of his house. Even though it was well past midnight, approaching two in the morning, there were lights on in the windows, and he could see Elfriede’s shadow cross the kitchen.</p><p>He sat in the car with his lights off and watched her silhouette move across the room. He pretended like she was someone else, but he didn’t know who. When she stopped her pacing around the kitchen and stood in front of the window watching him, Reuenthal finally turned off the car and walked up to the house, splashing through the invisible puddles in the driveway and slamming open the side door.</p><p>When he made it into the kitchen, she was no longer there. This was a familiar game, at this point. If he stopped in the kitchen, or went into the living room to get himself a drink, she would wander through the building like a ghost, creaking on the stairs and on the floor overhead, letting Reuenthal only catch glimpses of her in windows or doorways until he hunted her down.</p><p>It was hot inside, almost unbearably so. Elfriede wanted things to be so warm. She once said that it was the only thing she had liked about being trapped in her family’s frontier home— it was tropical. Reuenthal could hardly imagine it, except that his house had become like a sauna. He wondered if she would do this all through the summer, raising the temperature degree by degree, until they both boiled to death in it.</p><p>The kitchen smelled like spoiled milk. He discovered the culprit immediately, a half-gallon that had been left out on the countertop, open. He was unsure when it had gone bad, or why it had been left there, but he poured it down the sink— thick, white slime coating the stainless steel.</p><p>He could still feel the alcohol in his system, distantly, and the throbbing of his head, more distantly still. The hot air of the house pressed down upon him and made him feel dizzy as he swam through it, up the stairs and down the hall. He still was in the habit of moving silently, no matter how disoriented he was, and so Elfriede didn’t hear him coming until he stood in the doorway of the master bedroom, or she would have turned around to face the door before he arrived.</p><p>She was standing at the window, naked, curtains pulled all the way open. The window faced the back of the house, and there were no neighbors for a quarter mile anyway, so no one but Reuenthal could see her.</p><p>“Were you waiting for me?” Reuenthal asked.</p><p>Elfriede spun around, startled. He didn’t know why she was so surprised. She had known he was coming, even if she hadn’t heard his footsteps in the hallway.</p><p>“No,” she said. When he studied her more closely, he saw that she was wet with rainwater— the window behind her was open, and drops were tracing their way down her skin. She had goosebumps on her arms, and her hair hadn’t been washed in several days— it fell limply around her shoulders.</p><p>“Then why are you still up?”</p><p>“You think I’m going to go to bed just because you’re here?” This was the opening salvo of an old argument. He would tell her that she obviously would be.  They would go through a few lines of back and forth exchange to escalate, and she would call him a splenetic egoist, or something like it, and he would call her a cunt.</p><p>Thinking of going through with this, Reuenthal’s head throbbed like an open wound. He stepped through the doorway without saying anything else and began mechanically removing his constricting jacket. Elfriede watched him.</p><p>“Did you have a bad time with your friends?” she asked mockingly.</p><p>Reuenthal continued to say nothing. She was like the buzzing of an insect in his ears.</p><p>“I don’t know why you bothered to go.”</p><p>He struggled with the crimson fabric of his cravat. Before he could get it off, Elfriede came up behind him and slipped her fingers beneath the band, taking up all the slack and making the silk cut into his throat, making the knot impossible to undo. He could still breathe, for now. Her hands were hot on his skin, sliding across his neck, to press on the soft flesh just below his jaw.</p><p>“What do you want?” Reuenthal asked. It wasn’t a necessary question— he knew exactly what she wanted from him. She wanted him to get angry enough to turn around, to lay hands on her, to give her an excuse to hit and claw with impunity. To make it so that if he wanted something from her, he would have to take it by force. He sometimes tried to see if he could make her strike first, but she had a way of provoking him, and he had never yet succeeded in remaining entirely unflinching under her insults and touches that didn’t quite make it to pain. He wondered what it would take to make her break, to make her anger come uncorked completely.</p><p>It was easy to understand why she had more restraint, why she didn’t crack into immediate violence no matter how much he tried to twist verbal knives— they were very similar people, in their way. She was scared of him. If she was on the defensive, if she made him strike first, she could unleash her whole strength at him, struggling and writhing. She enjoyed that liberation. But if she struck first— what would he do? How far would he allow his strength to take him? This was a question that Reuenthal wasn’t even sure he knew the answer to. At his core, he knew that even in his darkest moments, he always had an iron shell of self restraint that he had not managed to crack. How many times had he stood on a precipice and not thrown himself off? A number too high to remember or count. </p><p>It was interesting to wonder how far he would go, if that shell ever broke. They danced on the edge of that question, afraid of falling off the cliff, and on better days it was easy to eroticise the fear. Today was not one of those better days.</p><p>Elfriede hadn’t answered his question, and instead just tightened the pressure on his throat. It made it hard to swallow, pressing against his Adam’s apple. He wondered what she would do if he just stood there and took it. He closed his eyes. The world, having narrowed to the sensation of her hands on his neck, crashed around him like waves. He couldn’t hear her breathing anymore, though it had been harsh and loud a moment ago. His ears rang.</p><p>He had some time in the space between taking his last breath and losing consciousness— he had the luxury of deciding if he wanted to allow it or not. The image of himself falling to the floor, his body completely vulnerable without his mind to inhabit it, flashed across his vision. In his imagination, he controlled Elfriede, inhabited her skin, let her loom over him with deadly intent, watched his empty shell from above, struck it. In his mind, he could be the knife and the wound at the same time. </p><p>But that was a fantasy, and he couldn’t allow it to become real. He toppled forward, pretending to lose consciousness. Elfriede’s hands were stuck in the fabric of his cravat, and she came down with him, hard, her body heavy on his back. She yanked her hands free, and Reuenthal flipped them both over and grabbed her wrists, pinning her to the wooden floor. He loomed over her now, trapping her body completely beneath his, their faces together, breathing heavily. The oxygen rushed back into his blood, fizzing and electric.</p><p>“What do you want?” she asked him in a snarl. She tried to squirm out of his hold, but they both knew that she wouldn’t be able to get up until he let her go. Abstractly, he thought it was a pity that she hadn’t let him undress first. He would have to let go of her hands to take off his pants, and this would lose the moment.</p><p>She clearly knew this, too. Although she kept trying to free her hands from where he had them pinned above her head, at the same time, she was rubbing herself against him.</p><p>“You’re disgusting,” Reuenthal said, but he forced his leg in between hers, bearing down, giving her the pressure from his thigh that she was looking for.</p><p>“So are you,” she said through gritted teeth.</p><p>She was right. He matched her movement for movement, her leg between his. A push and pull, if not a give and take. It was unpleasant to the point of pain, but there was still enough there that he wanted it desperately, couldn’t stop himself from seeking it out. His nails dug into her wrists; she bit at his collarbone hard enough to bruise.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t understand Mittermeyer. He understood perfectly well how in the moment he could be happy, because the moment pushed out every other thought. This was true for Reuenthal now, though it wasn’t happiness. It wasn’t anything. There was a kind of emptiness that came from overwhelming every receptive channel in his body— the signals became a violent white noise: a static, electric. There were other ways to get to this place, but this was the way he got there now.</p><p>This emptiness carried him through the act to the end. It carried him past the disgust that drifted across the surface of his thoughts when they were both done, when he looked at her body beneath him, beautiful and slick with sweat. It carried him through his cold shower, and lasted until he returned to the bedroom and found her still awake and waiting, though she had turned off the lights. The window was still open, and all the heat that she loved so much was slipping out into the rain, which was coming in to puddle on the floor. Reuenthal shut the window and tossed his towel onto the water before it could ruin the hardwood.</p><p>“You’re coming with me, tomorrow,” he said as he mopped up the water. He didn’t look at her.</p><p>“I didn’t think you wanted to show me to your friends.”</p><p>“Don’t embarrass me.” He tossed the towel into the laundry basket and got into bed. As he put his head down on the pillow, she leaned over him and ran her hand through his wet hair. The touch was gentle, but she twisted the short strands around, letting him know that she could pull it if she wanted to.</p><p>“What changed your mind?” she asked. And she tugged on his hair enough to make him know she wanted an answer to the question.</p><p>“They won’t stop asking about you,” he said. “It will shut them up.” This wasn’t the real reason, but he couldn’t find the words for what the reason was, and even if he had them, he certainly wouldn’t tell her.</p><p>“I doubt it,” she said. “People love to talk about a scandal.”</p><p>“Your family must be grateful that you provide them with so many interesting conversation topics.”</p><p>She twisted his hair again. “Don’t talk about my family.”</p><p>“No? I did at the bar.”</p><p>“And what did you say to your friends?”</p><p>“We were discussing how to destroy them,” he said. “Building our own castles in the sky above the ruins of Neue Sanssouci and your grand uncle’s control of the Kaiser.”</p><p>Her fingernails traced lines of ice across his scalp. “Duke Braunschweig hardly wants you to build him a new palace. He would be happy enough with the old one. Why would you need to tear it down?”</p><p>He could hear Yang in his voice when he spoke. “Why does it deserve to exist?”</p><p>“And your new castle in the sky would be different, somehow?”</p><p>“If the person on the throne is the one who built it, then they’re worthy of it. A living thing, not some relic handed down from useless son to useless son.”</p><p>“Hah,” she said. “I doubt it.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Even if Duke Braunschweig wins the throne through burning down his enemy’s house, he’s not any different. If you hate the Kaiser now, you’ll hate him, too.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Oh? Then why do you want to help him?”</p><p>He was silent, which made her tug on his hair again, until he slapped her hand away. She let go, and settled down into the bed to face him.</p><p>“So,” she said. “Who do you want to see on the throne?”</p><p>“After he wins, Duke Braunschweig will be weak, and he’ll think he’s consolidated his camp,” Reuenthal said. “That’s room for opportunity.”</p><p>“You’re a rebel to the bone,” Elfriede said. “But I don’t think you have the strength.”</p><p>Yang did— he knew this, as surely as he knew his own name— but Reuenthal would never say that to Elfriede. “If I didn’t, you wouldn’t be here,” he said.</p><p>That was enough to shut her up.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em> Yang </em>
</p><p>The wedding was being held in the garden outside Magdalena’s mansion, with dinner and dancing inside afterwards. It was well into spring, and though the weather had been predicted to be fine, there was a light drizzle of rain falling by the afternoon. The plans remained the same, though, rain or shine, as the wedding had always been expected to take place under tents. The largest was nestled in among the just-greening bushes, with a covered corridor that led from the back of the house to the seats.</p><p>Even though Yang felt like she had invited the entire population of Odin, Magdalena kept saying that this was a small wedding. For nobility, it probably was. Aside from Yang’s handful of friends, here was Magdalena’s huge number of extended relatives and acquaintances; the Braunschweigs, who needed to be invited to prevent offense; and many of Yang’s former coworkers. Yang was very grateful to Magdalena’s family servants for taking care of so much of the greeting and seating of the guests, because even the minimal amount of socializing that he did before the ceremony began left him exhausted. Even Magdalena, with her desire to control the show, had bowed to the necessity of hiring an event organizer, who kept the whole show moving forward. It took all the work off Yang’s plate, which meant he just had to show up and smile. That was about all he felt capable of doing, so that was for the best.</p><p>While he felt comfortable enough in his dress uniform, which he had worn so many times, it was his own skin that felt tight and itchy, and he was using all his self-restraint not to destroy the slick way his hair had been done by the stylist Maggie had hired. He wished that she was by his side as he walked around saying hello to people he knew, or barely knew. Without her to guide him through it all, he felt completely lost. She was hiding somewhere in the house, getting the last touches put on her outfit, which he had not been allowed to see— it was bad luck, or so she said. </p><p>But at least this feeling of missing her by his side did more than anything else to calm his nerves about being married. They needed each other, or at least he needed her. </p><p>As the appointed time drew closer, and the tent filled up with more and more people, Yang nervously walked around, and made his last few bits of small talk. Kircheis, who continued to take his duties as Yang’s aide seriously, followed him around as a buffer, even though he wasn’t part of the wedding ceremony in the least. Yang truly appreciated his help nonetheless.</p><p>It seemed a little too fraught to spend too much time speaking to his friends, especially Reuenthal and Mittermeyer, so Yang brought Kircheis over to introduce him to Admiral Merkatz and his daughter, Cora Feldmann. She was sitting in between Merkatz and Rear Admiral Bronner, which was an arrangement that Yang thought was an odd choice, but he wasn’t going to question it. There was a seat reserved for Commodore Staden on the other side of Merkatz, but he had gotten up to find some water in the house to take some stomach medication with, and so wasn’t here to say hello.</p><p>“I’m so glad your schedule permitted you to come, sir,” Yang said to Merkatz.</p><p>“Of course. I’m glad I happened to be on Odin. I really must congratulate you, Leigh. You’ve come a long way.”</p><p>Yang reached towards the back of his head to rub his hair, then remembered that his hair was supposed to stay neat, and dropped it awkwardly back down to his side. “Yes, sir.” His smile was uncomfortable, but Merkatz didn’t push the issue.</p><p>“And all of this because you didn’t pay attention to my warning about Baroness Westpfale,” his daughter Cora said with a laugh. “Maybe that’s for the best.”</p><p>“Well, she’s succeeded in putting a leash on me,” Yang said. “I think that’s what the intent was, wasn’t it?”</p><p>“I don’t think Baroness Westpfale, of all people, can be thanked for your good standing in society,” Bronner said, wrinkling his nose. “I think you should be thanking someone else.”</p><p>“You know, Rear Admiral, I did thank you in the acknowledgement section of my book,” Yang said. “I’ll get you a copy.”</p><p>“I’ve already read it, Leigh,” Bronner said, but he smiled, which made his owlish face look almost uncanny. Yang laughed.</p><p>“Admiral Merkatz, have you met my, er, aide, Lieutenant Kircheis?”</p><p>Kircheis had not expected to be dragged into this conversation, and he was startled— he had been looking across the tent to where the Braunschweigs were sitting. Hilde was over there, talking to Lady Elizabeth, sitting in the seat that had been reserved for Elizabeth’s fiancee, Hans von Vering. </p><p>“No, I haven’t had the pleasure,” Merkatz said. He offered his hand to Kircheis, who shook it.</p><p>“The pleasure is mine, sir,” Kircheis said.</p><p>“I figured I should introduce you, since it seems like we may be working together more closely again in the future.”</p><p>“Yes,” Merkatz said, though this was with a pinch of his lips. “That may be so.” He switched the topic. “I notice you didn’t introduce him to Rear Admiral Bronner— have the two of you already met?”</p><p>“Oh, yes, I’m very well acquainted with Lieutenant Kircheis. It’s no surprise to me that he was Commodore Leigh’s favorite student— they’re both humanitarians.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Merkatz asked.</p><p>“I’m sure Rear Admiral Bronner’s next remark will be to say how terrible of actors we are, as well,” Yang said dryly. </p><p>“Well, you wouldn’t want me to accuse you of anything else on your wedding day!”</p><p>Yang laughed. “Well, I’d say that there are far worse things in the world than being a humanitarian, or a bad actor.”</p><p>“Not many,” Bronner said. “But you’re lucky that there are some.”</p><p>“I think I’ve come around on humanitarianism,” Merkatz said.</p><p>“Really?” Yang looked up at him, startled.</p><p>“To a degree.”</p><p>“Well, everything to a degree,” Yang said wryly.</p><p>Merkatz’s tone became serious. “I’m afraid that without humanitarians close to the duke, we’ll see far more bloodshed than this nation can really withstand. I hope that you’re in a position to advise him well.”</p><p>This ruined the cheerful mood, but Yang nodded. And he was glad to have Merkatz on his side, at least. “I’ll do my best, sir,” he said. “I’m sure you don’t have any reason to doubt that.”</p><p>“I’m glad that I don’t have to doubt that we’ll be playing the same game, on the same team.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Yang said. </p><p>It looked like Bronner was about to make another comment, but Kircheis pointed out to Yang that the event organizer was coming over to shoo everyone back to their seats, including Kircheis, and to get Yang into position. He bid his leave of his former superiors and made his way up to the front of the room, waiting near the small band for the signal for the event to begin. His heart had begun to beat strangely, and he tried to calm it by looking out past the edge of the tent into the dripping rain. The noise behind him turned from social chatter to everyone trying to find their seats, and faded out in Yang’s ears, leaving only the soft dripping of the rain and the strings of the band. As the noise dimmed, Yang turned back to look at the assembled crowd.</p><p>Everyone was settled in the nice white event chairs on the green fake-grass carpet. There was Mittermeyer and Evangeline, smiling and turned backwards in their seats to speak a few remaining words to the rest of Yang’s friends, all with their assortment of wives and girlfriends who had come. Reuenthal sat next to Mittermeyer, but was quieter, and at his side was a beautiful blonde woman, wearing a dress that, even in Yang’s eyes, was about thirty years out of date. She must have been Elfriede von Kohlsrauch, though Reuenthal hadn’t yet introduced her to Yang. But still, Yang’s heart was warmed to see him there, and he smiled, even though Reuenthal wasn’t looking at him. Reuenthal was doing exactly what he had done just a moment before— his head was turned to look at the rain.</p><p>There was such a feeling of love and gratefulness in Yang’s heart as he looked over the gathering. During the rush to say hello to people, he hadn’t stopped to process how it felt to see all of his friends here at once— it overwhelmed him, and made him misty eyed. He wasn’t usually a tearful person, but he could have cried about that. He couldn’t quite comprehend that all of these people were here for him, and yet the evidence that they were was incontrovertible. It felt, for a moment, like he was where he belonged— even if that feeling came with twists of guilt. Most of these people were here for Hank von Leigh.</p><p>But his eyes settled on Reuenthal and Mittermeyer again. Reuenthal, as if feeling his gaze, turned to look at him. Yang tried to smile, but he wasn’t sure what came across on his face. Reuenthal looked away after a moment, but it was enough to shake Yang free of his winding thoughts.</p><p>The event organizer gave Yang the signal to move to the front of the room, on the small raised platform. He steeled himself, taking a breath, and nervously smoothed down the red sash of his dress uniform before he got into position.</p><p>Up front, Yang stood at attention and looked down the strip of red carpet towards the covered entryway of the tent, where he was waiting for Magdalena to emerge. Everyone’s eyes were on him, and the chatter under the tent faded to nothing. On some unspoken signal, the band’s music changed, and they struck up the wedding march.</p><p>Magdalena walked out of the open doors of the house, under the flower-bedecked archway, down the aisle. She was radiant in all white— perhaps the most beautiful woman Yang had ever seen. Her black hair fell in waves around her shoulders, and was topped with a silver and diamond tiara made to look like a dewy crown of roses. Her gown was voluminous, but she somehow made it look natural, moving with a grace that even at a distance made Yang feel clumsy and unprepared. Sheer lace wrapped around her arms and neck, and a veil fluttered over her face, doing little to obscure her ruby lips and her glittering eyes. Her cheeks were flushed, and her expression was so strange— he had never seen her look at him in quite that way before. But his expression must have matched hers— if anyone had asked him what he was feeling in that moment, he would have had to lie, because he had no idea how to name the strange and familiar feelings that were tumbling around in his heart.</p><p>It seemed to take forever for her to walk up the aisle towards him, but she eventually arrived and smiled at him. All of his nervousness fell away at that expression on her face. If she was there, as ready to go through with it as he was, then it would all be alright. </p><p>Before the wedding march had finished, before the celebrant— some Imperial priest that Madalena’s mother had chosen— stepped forward, Magdalena said, quietly enough that only he could hear, “I guess we really are getting our revenge on them all, aren’t we, Hank?”</p><p>She wasn’t serious, not really. “You’re right,” he said, smiling at her. “We are living well.”</p><p>She shook her head, but he could see that he had said the right thing— her face was twitching as she fought to stifle the smile that rose to her lips.</p><p>Later, Yang could hardly recall anything else that happened at the ceremony. All of the actions— the standing, the kneeling, the binding of the hands, the exchanging of rings— seemed to pass in a blur. He would have liked to have committed them to memory, to savor them later, but the only thing that stuck in his mind was the feeling of it. The world dimmed at the edges to only encompass Magdalena’s laughing eyes. It felt like they were, for a minute, the only two people in the world who really knew what was going on— like they were playing some kind of game, or joke, on the rest of the world, and they were on the winning team.</p><p>When it came to the profession of vows, it was very easy to swear to love one another in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, til death do us part. It was only when the officiant asked Magdalena if she took Hank von Leigh to be her husband that he felt anything other than like laughing. He looked deeply into her eyes, resisting the temptation to look anywhere else, and she cocked her head with a knowing smile. </p><p>“Of course I do, Hank,” she said.</p><p>“And you, Hank von Leigh, do you take Magdalena von Westpfale to be your wedded wife?”</p><p>“I do,” Yang said. And that was that.</p><p>And when he lifted up her veil to kiss her, she couldn’t stop herself from smiling so broadly that her lips no longer covered her teeth, and her lipstick ended up above his upper lip.</p><p>There was a loud wolf-whistle from the audience, which Yang, in a distant corner of his mind, suspected came from Bittenfeld.</p><p>At the end, the band struck up again, some rousing song, and Yang was swept along on a tide of well wishes, back into the house, clinging to Magdalena’s arm all the while. </p><p>After dinner and speeches, which Yang sat through with a flush of embarrassment permanently affixed to his face, there was dancing, and Magdalena and Yang had the first dance together. They had practiced, and while this couldn’t make Yang good at dancing by any stretch of the imagination, he was very happy that he didn’t step on Magdalena’s feet as her gown swirled around them both. As they spun across the center of the room, where they had first danced together years ago, Yang’s gaze crossed the room, watching everyone who watched them. Most people were simply eager for their own turn to dance, but he caught Mittermeyer’s eye, and then Reuenthal’s. The expressions on their faces couldn’t have been more different, but it seemed to Yang that they came from the same place. Mittermeyer’s broad smile wished Yang well, and while Reuenthal’s gaze was hard and cold, Yang knew that it was because it cost Reuenthal greatly to stand there and watch— and he was paying that price out of love. Yang wanted to go talk to him, but there hadn’t been a good moment to speak with him alone.</p><p>He kept dancing with Magdalena for a few more songs, until his limbs did finally stop cooperating with him, and he began to step on her toes. She let him go with a laugh, and went to find Evangeline to dance with. Yang sat back down at his table, and this gave the opportunity for everyone who wanted to say something to him to come over and do so. He wasn’t used to being the center of attention in any time other than being a teacher, so to adapt, he found himself slipping back into that casual teacher role, even when it was very funny to answer Magdalena’s mother’s questions about their honeymoon plans with his broadly gesticulating hand and lecture tone. He could feel Count Mariendorf’s indulgent smile at this— he had been on the receiving end of Yang’s talks in the past. Eventually, the dowager Westpfale and Count Mariendorf went off to dance to some of the slower songs, and new sets of people sat down to visit at Yang’s table like he was holding court.</p><p>Yang kept an eye on all the guests, watching the little cliques of nobles and friends form and move between each other. In one corner, the Braunschweig clan sat and didn’t dance, except for Flegel with a few of Magdalena’s cousins. Duke Braunschwieg helped himself to the wine, while Princess Amaraie watched the party like a hawk. “It’s a pity my father was unable to attend, Count von Leigh,” she had said when Yang went over to say hello to her.</p><p>“He sent me a card with his best wishes,” Yang said. “I hope that His Majesty is in good health.”</p><p>“As good as can be expected.”</p><p>But she didn’t want to put a pall on the party. And she kept an eye on her daughter, who did dance with her fiancee. Yang only spoke to Hans von Vering briefly, when Lady Elizabeth dragged him over. He was a healthy looking, stout young man a few years older than Elizabeth. There was nothing remarkable about him, but even as he spoke to Yang, he looked around the party with a judgemental stare. He followed Elizabeth around and often leaned over her to say something in her ear and visibly point at one of the other guests. His constant attachment to Elizabeth made Hilde, who had gone over to join the Braunschweig party, look bored and distracted. Yang eventually ordered Kircheis to stop running interference for him, and go cheer Hilde up. This seemed to work, because the two of them ended up laughing about something over by the windows.</p><p>The party was a cheerful one, despite the rain outside. It dripped down the tall windows of the ballroom and made grey shadows on the colorful array of dancers on the floor. Yang, though he hadn’t really expected to enjoy the party, found that he was. </p><p>Of course, the general peace of the wedding was not to last. It couldn’t, not with so many people who were tangled up in the politics of the court in attendance.</p><p>It was Bittenfeld who came over to give Yang a very drunk toast, who prevented Yang from understanding the beginning of the trouble until it was already far too late. Bittenfeld was telling Yang all about the drink that the bartender had invented (apparently) and how great it was that Yang was finally married and how Bittenfeld wished he had taken up Yang’s offer to steal his date to Mittermeyer’s wedding, years ago, and then it could have him as a count or whatever. Bittenfeld’s congratulations were completely sincere and harmless, and they made Magdalena laugh as he whacked Yang on the shoulder. But there was another voice, snide and loud, sitting at the table behind Yang, making sure that Yang could hear.</p><p>“So, Fraulein Kohlraush,” Baron Flegel said, “how is it that you, of all people, have found yourself at this particular wedding? I was under the impression that you were still on your family’s country lands.”</p><p>“I somehow doubt you thought that, Thomas,” she said. “You’ve always made yourself quite good at paying attention to gossip.”</p><p>“I saw you come in with that Rear Admiral Reuenthal. Isn’t he a little beneath you?”</p><p>“And if he is? What are you going to do about it?”</p><p>“I’d think your family would have something to say about it.”</p><p>“You don’t see them here, do you?”</p><p>“No, I don’t. That’s why I’m surprised that this is the circle you’ve chosen to run in. How far the mighty have fallen.”</p><p>“I don’t think you have room to talk. You’re here, too.”</p><p>“Only because the Kaiser would take offense if we weren’t.”</p><p>“And you care so much about the Kaiser’s opinion, now, do you?”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>“Of course,” she said. “And since you’re paying so much attention to the Kaiser’s opinion, because he’s above you in station, you must also be paying your due deference to the groom, since he’s a count, and you’re only a baron.”</p><p>“It was bad enough when he was only going to be marrying a baroness. That was almost funny.” There was real vitriol in Flegel’s voice, and from the way it grew louder, he must have turned his head to say it distinctly in Yang’s direction. Yang did his best to ignore it. He wasn’t going to cause a scene. No one else at his table seemed to be paying attention, but Yang’s hearing was fully focused on the conversation happening behind him, rather than the laughter of Magdalena and Bittenfeld in front of him.</p><p>“I’m sure you were laughing,” Elfriede said.</p><p>“But you should tell me— what are you doing with Reuenthal?”</p><p>“Why do you care?”</p><p>“Let’s call it my desire to know all the capital gossip. At least you can be assured that whatever you say, I’m not going to go talk about it with your family.” He laughed, like his joke had been funny.</p><p>“Then you must already know exactly what I’m doing,” she said. She sounded bored.</p><p>“Please, if you need someone to defend your honor— I would love the opportunity.”</p><p>“Is that so? Are you really here because you have some sort of grudge?”</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>Unfortunately, it was at this point that Reuenthal returned from the bar where he had been getting drinks.</p><p>“Baron Flegel,” he said in his cold voice.</p><p>“Reuenthal. Funny seeing you here.”</p><p>“Do you know each other?” Reuenthal asked Elfriede.</p><p>“Our families used to get along,” Elfriede said. </p><p>“I just came over to make sure Fraulein Kohlraush was doing well.”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t she be doing well?”</p><p>“The talk is that you’ve kidnapped her, and have been keeping her hostage in your house, doing all sorts of depraved things to her. I must say, some of the things that people say really stir the imagination.”</p><p>“<em> Rear Admiral </em> Flegel,” Reuenthal said, stress on the shared rank, “I suggest you hold your tongue, drink less, and worry about facts rather than gossip.”</p><p>“Or what, Reuenthal? You’ll key my car?” He laughed. “I’ve heard—”</p><p>Yang had enough. He was about to stand, but then another voice interrupted the conversation behind him.</p><p>“Baron Flegel,” Ansbach said, stepping in, clearly having been watching and wanting to make sure this didn’t escalate into a duel or something even less proprietous. “Duke Braunschweig is getting ready to leave. He suggests that you say your goodbyes.”</p><p>The silence behind Yang was deafening— it was like the temperature in the room had dropped several degrees. Yang feared that both Flegel and Reuenthal were about to put aside their hatreds of each other, to share a mutual dislike of Ansbach. He had no desire to see him eviscerated by either of them, so he stood and entered the conversation.</p><p>“Commodore Ansbach,” Yang said. “I’m sorry to hear that you and the duke are leaving already.”</p><p>“I apologize, Count Leigh. It’s a pity to leave early.” He put as much sarcasm into his voice as he could. If everyone here hated each other, that was easier than two of them standing in solidarity. Maybe.</p><p>“Well, I’ll see you soon enough, I suppose,” Yang said, rubbing the back of his head. “Thank you for coming, Baron Flegel. I know it’s all a bit out of your way.”</p><p>“The pleasure is mine,” Flegel said. And he stalked off. Ansbach nodded and swiftly followed him away.</p><p>“Is everything alright?” Yang asked when they had gone. Bittenfeld, at Yang’s table, was watching now.</p><p>“Fine,” Reuenthal said.</p><p>“Are you alright, Fraulein Kohlraush? I’m sorry— I probably should have stepped in earlier.” He hadn’t gotten any chance to speak with her before now, and he realized that he was leaving a very bad impression on her— weak and ineffectual. That was what her cold stare said. He rubbed the back of his head, and looked to Reuenthal to see if there was any hint of how he should speak to Elfriede, but there was nothing in Reuenthal’s face but a careful, uncaring mask.</p><p>“I’m fine, thank you, Count Leigh,” she said. She stood. “Congratulations on your marriage.”</p><p>“Er, thank you,” Yang said. “I’d love to have you and Reuenthal over for dinner someday— and get to meet you properly—”</p><p>She gave a cool smile. “Of course.”</p><p>She took Reuenthal’s elbow and left, leaving Yang to sit back down at his table. The good mood had been ruined, and Yang watched Reuenthal and Elfriede walk away, until they disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>“What was that all about?” Bittenfeld asked.</p><p>“Nothing,” Yang said. “Reuenthal just doesn’t know how to not pick a fight.”</p><p>Bittenfeld laughed. “Well, people can say what they want about Reuenthal— if he picks fights, at least he’s good at winning them.”</p><p>After the minor incident with Flegel, things calmed down, especially as people began to trickle out of the party, leaving only the guests who actually cared about the bride and groom, and who liked staying out late and getting very drunk. </p><p>Magdalena eventually demanded that Yang dance with her again, which did for a while. This time, she was nowhere near as comported as she was during their first dance, and she draped herself on Yang with wild abandon, and didn’t even mind when he stepped on her toes. She wouldn’t let go of him, except in brief moments to stop at a nearby table and take sips from the wine glass she had left there. She was trying to keep Yang’s full attention on herself, and it almost worked.</p><p>Yang saw Reuenthal head out of the glass doors that lead to the back of the house, where the empty tents sat silent in the drizzling rain. Yang disentangled himself from Magdalena’s arms, offering a mumbled excuse. She sighed, but gave him a little shove and let him go.</p><p> Yang slipped out of the party.</p><p>Reuenthal hadn’t gone far. He was walking underneath the tents outside, sticking his hand out into the water and collecting drops in his palm, but not getting fully wet. He didn’t seem to notice Yang following him. Though the tents were lit against the night with fairy lights, the rain made everything outside of them appear as through a fog, and Yang could no longer distinguish the figures in the windows of the house, no matter how brightly they were lit. He doubted that anyone could see him and Reuenthal out here, so it was the private moment that he had been looking for for days. He wondered if Reuenthal was giving him this opportunity on purpose, or if Yang was interrupting his private moment. </p><p>“Oskar,” Yang said, getting his attention when he was still about five meters away.</p><p>Reuenthal turned on his heel, looking at Yang with undisguised surprise. “I thought you’d be busy inside,” he said. “You’re a bad host, abandoning the guests at your own party.”</p><p>“I’ll go back in. I just… If you were leaving, I wanted to say goodbye.”</p><p>“I’m not leaving.”</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p>“So, you can go back inside.”</p><p>“They don’t need me in there right away,” Yang said. “It’s nice to get some air.” He came up beside Reuenthal and put his hand on his back. They stood silently and watched the rain drip down for a moment. </p><p>“Thank you for coming,” Yang said. “It means a lot to me.”</p><p>Reuenthal nodded.</p><p>“I feel like I’ve hardly seen you since you came back to Odin. I hope—”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Yang’s grimace was still a little cheerful. “You wouldn’t want me to say that I hope you’re doing okay.”</p><p>“You’re allowed to say it,” Reuenthal said. It was funny, the way that conversations they had years ago stuck in their minds, formed a basis of shared understanding. There was tenderness in that— their way of silently confirming that they still had each other. A call and response.</p><p>“Then I do hope so,” Yang said. </p><p>“I’m fine, Wen-li.”</p><p>Surely, Reuenthal knew exactly how much it meant to hear him say his name. Even if Reuenthal was lying, it made Yang want to believe him. “I’m glad. You know, I meant what I said, earlier.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You and Fraulein Kohlrausch should come to dinner sometime. I would like to get to know her.”</p><p>“Mittermeyer said the same thing.”</p><p>“I’m not surprised. You should take him up on the offer.”</p><p>“Maybe.” It was no, but Yang hadn’t expected much different. He didn’t want to argue right now. </p><p>“We’re just looking for excuses to see you more often. But if you want to just go out some night, the two of us…” He trailed off and further destroyed his hairstyle, running his hand through it. “And you’re always welcome to come see me.” If he had said aloud that he missed Reuenthal, that would have been rejected out of hand. But he tried to put the sentiment into his invitation anyway. “It was nice when we were on Iserlohn.”</p><p>Reuenthal was silent for a little while. “It’s a different world,” he said. “There’s different considerations.”</p><p>“Is it?”</p><p>Reuenthal frowned, but the yellow fairy lights softened the expression. “You know it is, Leigh.”</p><p>He was making a point, and he wasn’t being too cruel, but he was the only one who would point out the things closest to Yang’s heart. “When it’s just us, it doesn’t have to be.”</p><p>He knew it was a bit of a facile thing to say when they were standing out in the rain, outside his own wedding. They could spend individual moments pretending like the outside world didn’t exist— that whatever space they carved, it was for them alone— but that didn’t make it true. </p><p>“When—” Reuenthal began.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You still have my loyalty,” Reuenthal said. It didn’t follow from his aborted sentence, but perhaps he didn’t want to talk about the future.</p><p>“I never doubted that for a moment,” Yang said. “Not ever.”</p><p>Yang wished that there was something he could give to Reuenthal in return— Reuenthal was asking for something by professing his loyalty. It was the closest promise he was allowed to give. In his pocket, Yang twisted the gold band on his finger. He would have to get used to that.</p><p>“Will you use it, though?”</p><p>“Yes,” Yang said. “If you want me to.”</p><p>Reuenthal nodded. There was tension in his back, even as Yang ran his hand up and down it.</p><p>“I don’t think I can do this without you,” Yang said, hitting upon something he felt like he could give Reuenthal, that might accept. “I need you. And Mittermeyer.”</p><p>“You could,” Reuenthal said. “You always beat me in our games.”</p><p>“No, I didn’t,” Yang said. “And we’re not in a game anymore.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t matter if we were. You always played the game on a different level than the rest of us.”</p><p>“I wish it all wasn’t. I wish—”</p><p>“What, Wen-li?” </p><p>“If it was a game, I wouldn’t have to worry about it.” He shook his head. “But I keep having nightmares.”</p><p>“I don’t know why,” Reuenthal said. “You’re going to win.”</p><p>The confidence that Reuenthal had in him was undeserved, but Reuenthal probably wouldn’t hear otherwise, so Yang accepted the premise. </p><p>“It’s not about winning,” Yang said. “Even if the game’s rigged for me to win, and the ending’s a foregone conclusion— what is it going to take to get there? That’s— that’s what I’m worried about.”</p><p>“May I say something?”</p><p>“You don’t have to ask.”</p><p>Reuenthal was still staring out into the rain. “Don’t hold yourself back because of that,” he said. “Spend the loyalty you have to spend. Whatever it takes.”</p><p>Yang understood what Reuenthal was asking for. If he couldn’t live for Yang— he at least wanted Yang to promise to let him die for him. Why was that the one thing that Yang would never in a thousand lifetimes want to give him? Why was that the only thing that Reuenthal felt he had left to ask for?</p><p>He didn’t know what to say— refusing would hurt Reuenthal, and he couldn’t bring himself to accept— so instead he rested his head on Reuenthal’s shoulder. “It won’t come down to that,” he said.</p>

  <em>
    <span>May 488 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis let himself be lulled into a false sense of security by the beauty of spring on Odin. It was like everything in the world was softer for a few months. The weather was bright, and warmer than he remembered it being at this time of year. Every scrap of ground was lush with greenery. The wind was playful in his hair. The rain was soft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Martin had taken it into his mind to be strangely gentle and unargumentative to Kircheis. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This should have alerted him to something being wrong, the way Martin would ask him to go with him on the weekends someplace nice. He didn’t vanish in the evenings to spend time with his group of republican friends, and instead stuck close to Kircheis. When they had time, and the weather was good, they would go rent little boats to paddle around the lake in the grand nature reserve not far from the capital, and kiss among the weeping willows where no one could see them. Martin would stay up late and read him poetry, which Kircheis had always liked. He often tossed aside his schoolwork on the weekday evenings, and would do anything else just to spend time with Kircheis. Even when he was clearly busy with something that occupied his mind— the things that he did not allow Kircheis to know about— if Kircheis came into the room and found him frowning at a message on his phone, he would immediately put it away and deliberately smile, letting his outside concerns fall to the wayside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis recognized all this as unusual, but he wanted to to assign the credit to the weather, to Martin feeling done with school, to anything other than what he should have recognized it as: a sign of dangerous things to come, and Martin wanting to savor the moment while he had it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It all made Kircheis so </span>
  <em>
    <span>happy</span>
  </em>
  <span> that he didn’t want to think about the spring ending and what that would portend. Martin’s graduation from ONU was on Saturday, May 20th. On the night of Thursday the 18th, he lay beside Kircheis in bed. The windows were open, and the warm air was coming in. Even in the city, there was the sound of crickets and cicadas in the air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was spent and exhausted, the usual sluggish but pleasant sensation in all his limbs after sex. Still, he had enough energy to stroke Martin’s feathery hair as he lay against his chest. Martin had been so deliberate with everything he had done all evening— he had made a point of kissing Kircheis before he even was able to take off his uniform after work, and Kircheis had found him watching him as they ate dinner, a strange expression on his face. There was a calmness about him, when usually he was excitable. Their conversations hadn’t been laden with Martin’s tangents or diatribes, and so there had been long lapses of comfortable silence between them. The same was true now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there something on your mind?” Kircheis asked. “You’re quiet today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis remained silent, inviting Martin to elaborate, but he didn’t. He carded his fingers through Martin’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you want to go out to dinner tomorrow?” Kircheis asked. “I can try to get home from work early, so that we can beat the crowds.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I promised my advisor I’d go talk with him about my future plans,” Martin said. “I probably won’t be back until late.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright. I’ll save you some leftovers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to— he said to meet him at a bar. I’ll probably eat there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m jealous,” Kircheis said, his tone light. “Going out without me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was teasing,” Kircheis said. “I didn’t mean to imply anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. I just wanted to tell you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.” He pressed a kiss to the crown of Martin’s head. “Well, I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry I won’t be home tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” Kircheis said. “Maybe Sunday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe.” But there was something in Martin’s voice— hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis had to ask again. “What is on your mind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I got my service letter the other day,” Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Already? I thought—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They know when the university graduation is, and that’s when the standard deferment ends. I’m supposed to report by the end of the month.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Kircheis wanted to offer Martin assistance, of whatever kind he could, but he doubted that Martin would accept any of it. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t want you to worry. I wanted—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The spring to stay as it had been. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis wanted that, too, and he knew by asking his next question, he was making that impossible, but he had to ask it anyway. “What are you going to do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin shook his head, and Kircheis squeezed his eyes shut, and pulled Martin closer to his chest, clinging to his breathing, his heartbeat, the feeling of his stringy frame, warm and alive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t do anything you’ll regret,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Kircheis returned home to his and Martin’s shared apartment after work on Friday, he found the place cold and empty. Although he had expected that Martin would not be there, he could tell something was different immediately. From the instant he stepped into the door, he had the sensation that something vital that had once lived in the house had vanished. He would later realize that the instant sense of foreboding was from his subconscious processing of the scene; both Martin’s hiking boots and daily shoes were missing from their usual place near the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis took off his uniform jacket and hung it up on the hook near the entrance, taking just a minute to forestall any discovery that might lay further in. Nothing was awry in the kitchen, save for the dripping sink that their landlord had yet to fix, but when Kircheis walked into the bedroom, he found that the closet door was open, and all of Martin’s clothes were missing. The dresser, too, had been emptied. All that remained were Martin’s various trinkets on top of the bureau— his collection of miniature ancient statues, which he had made a habit of purchasing whenever he went to Odin’s national art museum. On the wall, there had once hung a picture of both of them and Hilde, taken at the Mariendorf house, but that photo had been removed, and only the frame was still there, sitting propped against the wall on the floor. In the living room, most of his books remained, but there were a few exceptions— the slender books of ancient poetry had vanished from their usual place of honor stacked on the top shelf. His toiletries were missing from the bathroom, and Kircheis’s toothbrush looked pathetic alone in its cup by the side of the sink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis sat down on the neatly made bed— the fact that Martin had bothered to make the bed as he walked out of Kircheis’s life without a trace struck him somewhere low in his chest— and picked up Martin’s pillow. It still smelled faintly of his shampoo, and Kircheis held it and stared at the empty picture frame on the floor until the ache in his heart turned into a numbness that allowed him to take out his phone and dial Hilde’s number. He didn’t know what he was going to say to her, but she was the only person he could imagine talking to in this moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t particularly unusual for him to call her, and she picked up after a few rings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi, Sieg,” she said, sounding slightly out of breath. “What’s up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her cheerful tone made Kircheis momentarily lose control of whatever he had been about to say, and his mouth opened silently. The silence over the line caused Hilde’s tone to change.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sieg?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde—” The tightness in his throat made it hard for him to get the word out. “Did you see Martin today?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was wary when she answered. “We had lunch together. He asked to meet me and we ate on campus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did he seem—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he alright?” There was a warble in her voice, and she clearly feared the worst.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s gone. He left.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you at home?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be there in twenty minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t go anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t think he could, even if he wanted to. His legs felt like they weren’t going to obey him any longer. He just kept sitting on the bed, thinking. The anger that he knew he should feel, for being abandoned without even any goodbye, hadn’t hit him, and he doubted that it ever would. The only thing he could register was fear for Martin’s safety, and an overwhelming grief. He knew why Martin had gone— it was for his sake— but that didn’t make it any easier to bear. The ugly thought that it would have been easier to accept if he had come home and found a body ran through his brain, but he knew that wasn’t really true. Martin intended to do something stupid, but the hope that he could stay safe, that he could still find some way to protect him, somehow made it all worse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He heard pounding footsteps on the stairs outside the apartment, and then Hilde ringing their doorbell. Had he already been sitting there for that long? Mechanically, he rose to his feet and went to unlock the door and let her in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde had been in his apartment many times. She would often stop by after her classes let out for the day to say hello, since Kircheis and Martin didn’t live far from the ONU campus. She looked around with an investigative eye the moment she stepped in the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He took both his pairs of shoes,” she said immediately. “He usually leaves his boots with yours, doesn’t he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He took most of his clothes,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did he leave a note?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t see one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked around briefly, and her eyes settled on the closed door to the second bedroom, the one he never slept in, the one with the brass SIEGFRIED KIRCHEIS nameplate he had taken from his dorm room at the IOA. “Did you check your room?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er, no,” he said. But he didn’t have a good reason not to look in there, so he did. Hilde followed behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was the neatly made spare twin bed, and the desk that he occasionally used when he needed to be completely undistracted to work, and a beat up old dresser that held their out of season clothes. This room was so small that it didn’t even have a closet— which was his excuse for hanging up his uniforms in Martin’s closet, if anyone had ever noticed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde scanned the room, though there wasn’t much to see. But when she walked around the other side of the bed to look at the nightstand, she said, “What do you usually keep in this safe? It looks like he wanted you to be aware he took something out of it— he left it open.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis’s blood ran cold. “It’s open?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde bent down and pulled out various documents and tossed them onto the bed. He felt ill watching her do this, primarily because the largest object that should have been first to be pulled out of the safe was not among the things she extracted, and, second, because among the innocuous paperwork— the copy of his birth certificate and some government bonds— there was his court orders detailing the conditions of his service in the fleet. She didn’t look too closely at the sheaf of papers, and Kircheis probably wouldn’t have minded her knowing, but, much like her presence in his false bedroom, it was something he would have liked to do on his own terms. Though considering all he had shared with Hilde over the years, and the fact that it had never managed to come up, maybe that time was never going to be any time but now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All yours,” Hilde said, glancing over the stack. “Did he keep all his papers in here, too? I assume you don’t have more than one safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My gun isn’t in there?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even in the dim light that came in through the window to the alley, he could see Hilde pale. “You kept a gun in there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My fleet sidearm,” Kircheis said. “It’s issued to me permanently as an officer, but I don’t need to take it to work. I keep it locked up.” And the safe stayed in this room, far out of thought and sight, since Martin didn’t like the idea of it in their bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she said. “It’s not there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis walked back out to the living room and sat down heavily on the couch. Hilde sat next to him, though she sat sideways and drew her knees up to her chest, an unfamiliar-on-her imitation of one of Commodore Leigh’s postures. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He took all his clothes, you said. And his papers. It probably means he’s not going to do anything dramatic right away,” Hilde pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know why he’s doing this, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He told me he had been served his fleet papers at lunch today. He sounded resigned, I guess. I asked him what he was planning to do, and he said he didn’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He knew,” Kircheis said. “That’s why he asked you to lunch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His way of saying goodbye…” Her voice was a little choked now. “I didn’t realize— he thanked me for being a good friend. I thought he was just being sentimental because he was graduating.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did he say to you?” Hilde asked. “I assume you didn’t know he was going to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should have,” Kircheis said. “I should have realized.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why? What did he say?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He didn’t want to say anything. I pressed him because he was acting strangely. He told me about being served his papers and—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told him not to do anything he would regret, and he said that he wouldn’t,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He thinks he isn’t going to regret just vanishing?” She was suddenly angry, voicing what Kircheis couldn’t bring himself to. “He thinks he can just </span>
  <em>
    <span>leave</span>
  </em>
  <span>— you’re his best friend—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love him,” Kircheis said. In the Imperial language, it wasn’t a sentence that could be misconstrued to mean something other than what it did. It stunned Hilde into silence, in which they could hear the sink dripping in the kitchen and the cars on the street outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Hilde said. “And he…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you tell me?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t told anyone,” Kircheis said. “Martin almost told you— maybe he thought you knew— but…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how long have you been keeping this to yourself?” She seemed somewhat incredulous.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since we were in high school. Seven years?” He did the math, which almost made it worse. They had kissed for the first time in the summer after his freshman year of high school, but there had been </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> there before that. It didn’t matter at this point— it was all so long ago, and that time in his life was gone for good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her face went through various contortions as she sorted it out in her brain. The issue at hand probably made any shock about the revelation feel less important— Kircheis was grateful for that, anway. “And he thought he could go without saying goodbye. Seven years?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t want to hurt me. I’m sure he thinks this is better than—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Than what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he told me what he was doing, where he is, he knows he’s putting me in danger. It’s against the law to not answer the summons. If he stayed here, he’d be arrested. He’s hiding, I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He took your gun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or he’s planning something. I don’t know— I was the one who told him not to tell me anything. It was safer for both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So he’s going to run and get killed doing something— and he expects you not to follow him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Kircheis’s turn to let the silence fall through the room. “Follow him how?” he asked after a moment. “Maybe he thinks if I run after him, I’ll join him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mouth was so dry. “I would want to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That didn’t exactly answer the question, but it seemed to satisfy her. “He’s going to get himself killed,” she said. “That’s what you’re saying?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I can stop him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no way to save Martin without stopping him, and Martin had known as well as Kircheis that there was no way that Kircheis could dissuade him from his path. If he left without saying goodbye, they would never have to face asking directly and refusing directly. If he left, there was always a possibility that Kircheis would chase him, follow him, down and down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you going to do?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis had never felt so lost in his life. “I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde let him stew in it for a moment, and then said, “If you don’t go find him, I will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And then what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he can’t stand it here, I’ll put him in my luggage and haul him to Phezzan, if I have to,” she said. But her anger was impotent, and they both knew that was impossible. She collected herself. “But really, Sieg, you’re going to try to find him, I assume?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should ask Hank for help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t need to be involved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wouldn’t hold it against you. Doesn’t he like Martin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He did, but that wasn’t the issue at hand. “Hilde— if I’m chasing Martin, Commodore Leigh is my superior—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’d understand,” Hilde said firmly. Her voice tinted melancholy. “I think he’d even understand if you found Martin and went AWOL yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That makes it worse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should ask for his help,” she said firmly. “He’d want to help you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>June 488 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis waited until the beginning of the next month to ask Leigh for help. He did some poking on his own, and he might have continued to do so, except for the fact that on June 5th, military police showed up at his apartment door, looking for Martin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was at home when they came, eating a very sad meal of microwaved canned pasta. He hadn’t yet taken off his uniform after dinner, since Martin was no longer around to be discomforted by him wearing it. When the doorbell rang, he initially ignored it, thinking it was probably just the mail, or someone wanting to prosthelytize for the Earth Church, but then the doorbell rang again, and he was forced to get up and answer it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the door were two MPs. Although it was clear from their uniforms that they were only enlisted men, even as an officer the sight of them was enough to put a chill down Kircheis’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of them leaned back and looked at the number outside Kircheis’s apartment door. They clearly hadn’t been expecting to meet someone in uniform, and they quickly moved to salute, and Kircheis saluted back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello,” Kircheis said. “What can I do for you, gentlemen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does a Herr Martin Bufholtz reside at this address?” one of them asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He used to,” Kircheis said. “He moved out after he graduated from ONU late last month. Now it’s just me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s your name, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lieutenant Siegfried Kircheis,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of them wrote that information down in a little memo pad.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May we come in, Lieutenant?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was the last thing Kircheis wanted, but he didn’t have any way to refuse, so he smiled and said, “Of course, gentlemen.” He held the door open, and both of them stomped their muddy boots into his kitchen, and neither of them took off their caps as they came inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I ask you a few questions?” one said, while the other began walking through the apartment. Kircheis had, luckily, taken his name off the false bedroom and had stripped the bed, leaving the room open and empty looking. The larger bed in the room he had once shared with Martin still looked normal for just one person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure how much I’ll be able to help you, but certainly. Did you want any tea?” Kircheis asked as he removed the remains of his dinner from the kitchen table and offered the MP a seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, thank you. This shouldn’t take long, sir. I’m just trying to find out where Herr Bufholtz has gone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I don’t know. When he moved out, he said he was taking a trip to see his family, and I assume that after that— well, I don’t know.” Kircheis shrugged. “You’re here because he didn’t show up for his Fleet summons, I assume.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” the MP said. “Not the hardest job to have, but someone’s gotta do it, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I can give you his family’s phone number, if you like. He might just be there,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d appreciate that, sir. You haven’t heard from him recently?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not since he left, no.” Kircheis pulled out a pad of paper and pen from one of the kitchen drawers, and consulted his phone to write down Martin’s uncle’s phone number, which was Kircheis’s landlord’s business partner. That family connection was the reason he was able to stay in this apartment so cheaply. They had both gotten a deal on it. As he scribbled the number down, Kircheis wondered if he was going to have to find a new place when his lease ended. Focusing on this small and mundane question let him avoid the terror for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did you know Herr Bufholtz, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hunh? Oh, we went to high school together. He needed a roommate to help pay rent, and I had a posting in the capital. I’d rather live near the nightlife than in officer housing, so it made sense for us to split this place. It’s not bad.” Even as he spoke, he was cognizant of the other officer looking around the house, opening the closet doors, looking in his desk, pulling books at random from the bookshelves and flipping through them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis felt like he was talking too much. He handed over his paper with the phone number on it. “That’s his uncle,” he said. “I’m afraid I don’t know his mother’s number or anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s fine, thank you, sir. I appreciate your helpfulness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was an awkward moment of silence. It was clear that though the interview was meant to extract some information, the primary purpose was to stop Kircheis from interfering while the other man went through his belongings. In the pause in the conversation, there was the sound of the MP rifling through Kircheis’s closet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s going to happen, if you find him— if I’m allowed to ask that?” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, if he cooperates, and it’s just some kind of honest mistake that he didn’t report, probably nothing but a reprimand,” the MPs said. “It’s if we don’t find him that it becomes an issue.” He laughed, but not in an amused way. Kircheis’s smile was thin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You put out a notice for his arrest, I assume?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir. That’s what we’d do.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other man finished his cursory and destructive search of Kircheis’s room, and came back out into the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you do happen to hear from him, I hope you’ll advise him to report for duty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if he doesn’t report, I do hope you call our number.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a card with the tips hotline number printed on it. Kircheis was horrified by it, but didn’t let that show on his face, and just took it to look at. The other side of the card read, “ANY INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICE DODGERS, REWARD, 500 REICHSMARKS.” He walked over and put it on his fridge with a magnet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I certainly will. Is there anything else I can help you gentlemen with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at the moment, sir. We’ll let you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They saluted Kircheis again, who saluted back, and he showed them out of his apartment. When they had gone, he slumped against the door. His heart rate, which had been calm and under control when they were talking to him, spiked, all of the panic he had been suppressing coming up at once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gazed at his apartment—  something sacrosanct had been violated by the MPs coming in and looking through his belongings. There were so many things that were out of place. When he was able to move again, he went through and fixed them all, feeling slimy. Last of all, he stood in his kitchen, looking at the card on the fridge. It hardened his resolve to find Martin. He would talk to Commodore Leigh at his next opportunity.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Commodore Leigh’s office was in the same state of disarray that it always was when Kircheis came to see him the next day. Leigh was looking out the window, chair tilted all the way back with his legs on his desk, so his view was up to the sky, where puffy white clouds were scuttling along, chased by the wind that whistled down the street. When Kircheis knocked and announced himself, Leigh rolled his head to look at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you usually go home around now?” Leigh asked. It was past the end of their assigned workday, but that didn’t mean much for either of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I figured I could catch you before I left,” he said. “You were at the Braunschweig house for most of the day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Leigh said with a frown. He straightened himself up and put his elbows on his desk, replacing his feet that had been up there a moment before. “What can I do for you, Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis shut the door of the office behind himself, and took the seat in front of Leigh’s desk. Leigh waited patiently for him to state his business— there was that kind and concerned look on his face: the intensity of his gaze and the slight furrow of his brow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I’ve come to ask you about a personal problem, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m happy to help,” Leigh said. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s about my friend Martin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh sighed. “I had wondered about him. Is he alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. He’s—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Missing?” The knowing tone of Leigh’s voice made Kircheis feel worse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid to admit that I’ve been keeping a little secret from you, Kircheis,” Leigh said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral Bronner has a special interest in you, and he informed me that Herr Bufholtz’s name had appeared on a list that one does not want their name to be on. I told him that neither you nor I knew anything about your friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you tell me that the rear admiral had asked you?” With anyone else, the direct question would have been cause for a reprimand, but Leigh just answered him honestly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t want to interfere in your business,” Leigh said. “And as far as Bronner is concerned, I was telling him the truth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was silent for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I figured you knew that you were being watched,” Leigh said. “And if you didn’t bring it up with me, it wasn’t something you wanted to talk about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did know he was watching me in some way,” Kircheis said. “I didn’t think he would involve you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The rear admiral likes to get my opinion on things. But you came to see me about it for a reason— and that’s probably why Bronner came to ask me what I knew. What can I help you with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“MPs came to my apartment looking for him yesterday,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I already was, but now I’m even more worried about him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to, but do you know what he’s doing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “He left without saying goodbye, and you didn’t lie to Rear Admiral Bronner when you said that I didn’t know where he was. He’s gone— I don’t know where.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He couldn’t have gone far,” Leigh said, somewhat bitterly. “Anybody who’s a flight risk, they make sure you can’t leave the planet, unless a noble’s smuggling you on their private ship. There’s no passenger ship to Phezzan that would be allowed to let him on board.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think he’s trying to go to Phezzan, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No? It’s the best place to be, if you want to start a new life.” Although there was an odd tone in Leigh’s voice, Kircheis was too focused on Martin to try to pry Leigh’s feelings about Phezzan apart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think he intends to stay here, and—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wants to make a difference.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you think so?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s the way he is, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I admire people who are like that,” Leigh said. “It’s unfortunate that it’s a dangerous life to live.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I were in Herr Bufholtz’s shoes, and I was committed to not running away, and staying to make a difference, I’d be waiting for the same things I’m waiting for now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis didn’t want to ask— even before Martin had vanished he hadn’t wanted to put a timer on the end of what passed for peace around here— but he wanted to know how long Martin had to wait. “How long do you think it will be before the Kaiser dies?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a doctor, Kircheis.” This was Leigh’s way of saying he didn’t want to think about it, either. “Months, maybe. I don’t think there’s any way it would be more than a year. That’s what Princess Amarie has said.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think Martin will wait years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s not a patient man?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s not a careful one,” Kircheis admitted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh nodded. “I see. Is there something you’d like me to do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could you ask your man on Phezzan to keep an eye out? Just in case. If he does make it to Phezzan, it would be a relief to know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can ask,” Leigh said. “But you don’t think he’s headed that direction.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I just don’t know what else to do, or where else to look.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh leaned forward on his elbows and looked at Kircheis intently for a second. “Do you want to find him?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you do,” Leigh said. His voice was very gentle, but his words cut right to the heart. “You want to find him, but you’re afraid of what will happen when you do. That doesn’t change the fact that it’s what you want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was right, of course. “Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh tilted his head. “I’m sure it’s not the same situation, but you will recall that the reason both of us are working for Duke Braunschweig is that I gave up quite a lot to find my friend, Rear Admiral Mittermeyer, when he was in trouble. I wouldn’t blame you at all for doing what you have to do for friendship. That’s worth more than most things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know it’s difficult,” Leigh said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if I do want to find him, I don’t know how. I don’t know where he went.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh steepled his fingers. “Does </span>
  <em>
    <span>he </span>
  </em>
  <span>want </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>to find him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I— Probably.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then if you tell him that you want to meet, he will tell you how to find him. I assume you have some kind of code that he would recognize, even if you have to invent one now. It’s easy, when you know someone well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis felt nauseous. “If I did that, he’d think that I wanted to join him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to find him, if you don’t want him to think that,” Leigh said. “But do what you need to do for peace of mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And be careful, whatever you do. You are being watched. I don’t think Rear Admiral Bronner is out to get you, but he does like to know things, especially the way the winds blow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there anything else I can help you with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A flush rose to Kircheis’s cheeks. “There is one thing, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin stole my sidearm when he left. If there’s an inventory, I’ll be marked as missing it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh promptly reached down and opened his desk drawer. He took out his own sidearm, which had apparently been laying in there, and held it out to Kircheis. “Here’s a replacement.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir, you can’t give me yours!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not? It’s not like I’m capable of using it well. Here.” He kept holding it out until Kircheis reluctantly took it, and clipped the holster onto his belt beneath his uniform jacket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome.” He smiled. “I’m sure if it comes down to it, I’ll be safer with it in your hands than with it in my own.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed like Leigh had something else to say to him, so Kircheis waited a moment before standing to go. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you probably won’t want to tell me the details,” Leigh said. “But I hope…things go well with your friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next night, Kircheis dressed in dark clothing, tucked his distinctive hair beneath a cap, donned a large pair of reading glasses purchased from the drug store, and walked through the center of the city, a can of spray paint tucked into the satchel that swung at his side. He had a destination in mind, though he was open to alternate possibilities if any occurred to him on the way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was almost waylaid by the Earth Church headquarters, the one that had burnt down several years ago, and had now been reconstructed on the same spot with a smooth concrete facade, something so unlike the usual Imperial architectural style that it was a wonder they had ever gotten a building permit. But eyeing the security cameras that dotted the corners of the building conspicuously, Kircheis moved on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He almost turned down towards the residential part of the city, where brownstones clustered close together, and where had once been arrested on Martin’s behalf. But he figured that there was no reason that Martin would ever be looking at that old house again, and so Kircheis didn’t walk in that direction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, he made his way towards Triangle Street, which was dark and eerie at this time of night, even with the streetlights. There was rarely anyone in the odd, triangular plaza, even on a busy day, and this was after midnight. He looked around, just for good measure, and wished he had a spotter with him. But the only person he could have invited was Hilde, and he didn’t want to involve her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his can of white spray paint, and the rattle of it echoed and bounced off the tall buildings around him, announcing his presence like an alarm. But no one came out of any of the buildings, and the cars that drove by on the main streets didn’t stop, though their headlights briefly illuminated the whole square, flashing like lightning bolts as the cars rumbled by.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the wall, in an unfamiliar script, Kircheis carefully wrote a fragment of a poem.</span>
</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <span>τᾶς κε βολλοίμαν ἔρατόν τε βᾶμα</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>κἀμάρυχμα λάμπρον ἴδην προσώπω</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>ἢ τὰ Λύδων ἄρματα κἀν ὄπλοισι</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>πεσδομάχεντας.</span>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a week later that a postcard appeared in Kircheis’s mailbox. The front was a picture of birds flying over the ocean, with a picturesque sailboat cresting a wave beneath them— it was the kind of postcard that one could get in a tourist shop near any of the beaches about an hour’s drive from the capital. This one bore the name of what Kircheis presumed was a bar in the corner: The Captain’s Lounge. The back was scrawled in Martin’s undisguised handwriting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m enjoying my summer vacation. You’d like the beach too, if you ever left your office. Come by on Friday, and I’ll buy you a drink. Love, Your Anactoria”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis laid the postcard on his kitchen table and stared at it for a long time. It was dangerous for both of them if he did go visit Martin. He doubted that Martin was staying anywhere near this particular beach and this particular bar— he was probably in the capital still, which would be how he saw Kircheis’s message in the first place— but it was a good idea to meet further away. Especially if Martin didn’t trust him. Although he had been the one to request the meeting, the fear of what he would say to Martin when he saw him made Kircheis want to skip it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had asked to meet under the pretense that he wanted to join Martin— he knew that was how Martin would interpret his message. He didn’t want to join him. He wanted something impossible, and what was there to say to Martin about that impossibility?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he asked for the day off of work, which Leigh granted him without any comment, and Kircheis took an early morning train out to the beach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sun was just coming up when he arrived, and it hadn’t yet cut through the fog that crept over the salt marshes that turned into beachhead further down. Herons stood with their tall legs among the reeds, and gulls wheeled and cawed overhead. Kircheis walked the kilometer or so from the train station over the paved bridge road through the marsh, towards the beach, which was empty except for a few people hunting for shellfish and a few others running their dogs through the packed sand where the tide had just gone out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis took off his shoes and rolled up the legs of his pants to walk along the beach. He let the cold ocean water wash over his feet, and he trekked towards the boardwalk a ways away where there were a few restaurants and closed carnival games. It was too early for any tourists to be on the boardwalk— there were only a few local fishermen dangling their long poles out over the deeper water. But this was where Martin had asked to meet— there was the bar at the beachside end of the structure— so Kircheis climbed the wooden steps and walked along until he reached the far end, and he leaned against the railing, looking out over the ocean.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sun was burning off the fog now, and the morning light glittered on the waves beneath their foamy crests. It was going to be a hot day, but the air was still cool for now. Kircheis had brought a book to read, in case he had to wait for Martin to appear, but watching the low tide begin to roll back in was enough to occupy him for a long while. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was so engrossed that he didn’t notice someone coming up behind him until he felt a hand on his shoulder. He whirled, and for a moment didn’t recognize the person before him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin had bleached his hair to a straw blond and cut it short. He was dressed in an outfit that seemed wholly unsuited to him— a pair of workman’s jeans and a loose and stained shirt, tied with a messy kerchief at his throat. They were so unlike his usual neat clothing that they changed his whole silhouette. But all the rough fabrics in the world couldn’t disguise the way his hands were uncalloused, and his limbs were willowy. He had a canvas bag slung across his back, though it looked mostly empty, probably just holding a bagged lunch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t expect you to be here so early,” Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t give me a time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How strange, that these were the first words they said to each other. Had Kircheis been expecting Martin to fall into his arms, right there on the beach? No. But there had been a part of him that had hoped for it, nonetheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t bring much,” Martin said, pointing at the satchel that swung by Kircheis’s side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should we really talk here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you’re right.” Martin looked around warily. Though there had been only fishermen out when Kircheis arrived, there were now more people trickling onto the boardwalk, the early summer crowd, and some of the vendors were rattling open their metal stall doors and beginning to play music that wavered through the salty air, breaking the morning stillness. “You weren’t followed, were you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t think so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked together back down the boardwalk and away from the beach, back towards the salt marsh. There was an area of rolling sandy dunes before they sank down into the still water of the swamp on one side, and the packed sand of the beach on the other. This was where they headed, finding a place like a basket of scrubby grass woven into the crumbling, sandy earth. It was cool and shady in their hollow between the dunes, and the sand walls were tall enough to hide them completely from sight when they sat. They took up positions across from each other, their knees close enough to touch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so glad you came,” Martin said, as soon as they were hidden. “I had hoped you would. But I didn’t want to presume anything—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You left without saying goodbye.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Martin said. “I’m sorry. I didn’t have a choice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did. You could have told me what you were going to do. I wouldn’t have stopped you. I don’t think I could have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would have tried, and then you wouldn’t have come to find me here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you really think that I would just never want to see you again?” Kircheis asked. Although he was trying to stay calm, and he was usually good at it, the pain crept into his voice. “Do you really think that about me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Marin said. “But if you had tried to stop me then, I probably wouldn’t have let you find me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis ripped at the grass that grew from the dunes. Its roots went deep, and it was wiry and scratched his hands as he tried to pull it out. “I would have tried anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” There was a moment of silence. “I’m so glad you came. I didn’t really know what I was going to do without you. You’ll make things so much better when—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin—” It was Martin’s fantasies that brought Kircheis down to reality.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sieg?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not here to join you,” Kircheis said. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin’s whole demeanor changed. He tensed, and his face lost its pleased smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why are you here?” Despite the warmth of the sun cresting over the dunes, with Martin’s icy voice, it was suddenly cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Truthfully, Kircheis didn’t know the answer to that question. “Because I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But not enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin— don’t—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t what?” he asked. “Don’t say what we’re both thinking? Isn’t that the only thing I’m good at? Speaking truth to power?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What power?” Kircheis asked. “I don’t have any power over you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s funny that you can think that. You could have me arrested right now. You could kill me— you’re stronger than I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You stole my gun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin lifted his chin. “I did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you bring it with you today? Just in case?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if I did? Did you bring a weapon?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, he hadn’t. Commodore Leigh’s gun was locked up in his safe at home. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “I didn’t ever think you would hold me at gunpoint. If I’m wrong, then I’m sorry for having misjudged you. And I’m sorry that you thought that I would be the kind of person you’d need to point a gun at.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t bring it,” Martin said, but he was lying. Kircheis could always tell when he was lying. His gaze twitched towards his canvas bag, sitting in the sand next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had happened so long ago that it almost felt more like a dream than a memory, but Kircheis remembered the day he had spent in the forest with Reinhard, when he had been terrified of Reinhard’s potential for violence, and Reinhard had soothed him by pressing the gun into Kircheis’s hands, entrusting him with everything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin didn’t trust him at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They looked at each other in silence, until Martin looked away. “Why did you leave a message that sounded like you wanted to join me? I didn’t think you were a liar.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to see you,” Kircheis said. “And I want to protect you— to make sure you’re safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The best way to do that is to stay away from me, if you’re not going to help me. You’re being watched— I know that. It’s dangerous for you to meet me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do want to help you,” Kircheis said. “I just can’t blindly leap into whatever you’re planning. I don’t want to watch you throw your life away. I could help you get to Phezzan, or—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis didn’t bother asking why not. “Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why won’t you come with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If things were different, I would,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Different how?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If he had never met Commodore Leigh— that was the way it would have to be different. Seeing Leigh’s plans, so real, made it clear that if there was a way to make the galaxy better, it was by helping him. Martin was doomed to fail, Kirchies was sure of it, even if he didn’t know exactly what Martin’s plans were. If he hadn’t met Leigh, he might have been content to try and fail at Martin’s side. Or maybe he was lying to himself, and if they were in different positions, he would have done anything to keep Martin alive and safe, just like he always had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Kircheis said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish you’d figure out what you’re doing,” Martin said, and his voice was purposefully cruel. “It’s all very easy to see, if you open your eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish it was easy for me.” He paused. “I have always loved that about you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want me to be to you, Martin?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What I want you to be and what you are are two totally different things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to stop loving you— don’t make me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t join me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to leave you, either. I don’t know how you can just walk out of my life— I wouldn’t have done that to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t have?” Martin asked. His voice was still cold. “You’ve run away on some errand that would have killed you, if you hadn’t been lucky. If you had died on Cahokia, or planet Castrop, or wherever you’re sent next, how is that any different?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not intending to get killed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And neither am I.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were several things that Kircheis could have said. He wanted to point out that Martin had never been good at protecting himself without Kircheis there to save him. But instead, he said, “And what do you think is going to happen to you when you take my handgun and charge into Neue Sanssouci after the Kaiser dies? I assume that’s what you’re going to do, or something just as futile.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not futile.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think that you can stand up against the whole of the Empire? You alone?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the first time, there was regret in Martin’s voice. “I would prefer not to be alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t watch you throw your life away on something pointless!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not pointless. That’s you problem, Sieg. It matters to me, even if it doesn’t to you. At least if I die, I’ll be doing it for something right, something that </span>
  <em>
    <span>means</span>
  </em>
  <span> something, not just because your superior ordered you to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m trying to fix it, too,” Kircheis said. “There’s an actual plan to make this place better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And that’s what you’ll tell yourself when Duke Braunschweig orders you to kill for his right to the throne. I think you can justify a lot by telling yourself that it’s all for the best.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So can you!” Kircheis said. “You can be as cruel as you want me, if you tell yourself that you’re right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” he said. “Because I am right, and I’m going to do the right thing, no matter what it takes. I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t, and I don’t know how you can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I don’t just care about myself,” Kircheis said. “I can’t throw away a decade of my life with you— or anyone else I know. I can’t be that selfish.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But it hasn’t occurred to you that there are people in the world outside of you and me, billions of them. I think their lives matter a little bit more than whatever you feel.” Martin was breathing heavily, and a flush had risen to his cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis wanted to shake him. None of those billions of strangers would know or care that Martin was going to kill himself for them, but Kircheis would be the one who would have to bear it. But telling Martin that wouldn’t have made any difference, so he didn’t say it. Instead, he looked at Martin in silence, and wondered if there was anything he could say. Martin tried to calm his breathing, and he looked away from Kircheis, though there was nothing to see over the top of the dune except for the sky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope it’s worth it,” Kircheis finally said. “I hope it makes you happy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t matter if it makes me happy. It’s something I have to do. Maybe you’ll get that, someday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin stood. As he did, he knocked over his bag, which had been sitting next to him. It flopped down the side of the dune. When Martin grabbed for it in a panic, sending rivulets of sand cascading down around his sliding feet, the gun fell out onto the sand and came to a stop in the lowest part of the hollow between the dunes. They both looked at it, and neither of them moved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Keep it,” Kircheis said. “If it’ll help you stay safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin picked up the gun and shoved it back into his bag, which he slung over his shoulder. He didn’t look at Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I see you again sometime?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What good would it do either of us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe none. But I don’t want to leave you like this, and never see you again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin scuffed the ground with his toe. “I don’t want to listen to you begging me to give up everything I stand for,” he said. “It makes me think less of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t try to stop you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll think about it,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was the best Kircheis was going to get, so he nodded. Martin looked at him for a second longer, then scrambled up the side of the dune and slid down the other side, headed back to the beach. Kircheis leaned back into the stiff grass and looked up at the sky, watching the birds wheel overhead.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>October 488 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was asleep in his empty apartment when his phone rang. After months, he had gotten used to sleeping by himself in the queen bed, but he still sometimes woke up disoriented when he got tangled in the sheets, reaching for a body that wasn’t there. There was that moment of disorientation now, as the phone buzzed and jangled on his nightstand, and Kircheis sat up in a thrashing panic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was only one type of phone call that Kircheis could get at three in the morning— a bad one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a moment for Kircheis to gather his wits about him in the dark, trying to think past the loud ringing. He centered himself by looking around in the dimness and reminding himself of the familiar furniture, only the outlines visible. It was pouring rain outside, and the window of his bedroom was smeared with the water dripping down, rendering the streetlights an indistinguishable orange haze in the darkness, casting strange glows onto the ceiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He answered the phone before its fourth ring.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kircheis—” It was Commodore Leigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said. “What’s happening.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Kaiser died about an hour ago,” Leigh said. “Duke Braunschweig is going to evacuate his family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis had been prepared for this happening. Something clicked in his mind, and he put away everything other than the task Leigh had for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you need me to do, sir?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence from the other end of the line. “Lichenlade controls part of the military police,” he said, though Kircheis already knew that. “All of Duke Braunschweig’s allies are in danger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go to the Mariendorf house. Do whatever the count tells you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir— what about you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think we’ll meet up— Count Mariendorf will probably need to join the duke, but everyone knows he’s an ally that the duke considers valuable, and I don’t have anyone else I can send—” Of course, all of the duke’s small staff on the planet would be helping evacuate his household.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said. “I’ll go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do what the count tells you,” Leigh said again. “Whatever he says.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Kircheis—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You too, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leigh hung up the phone. It took less than two minutes for Kircheis to get his clothes on, get his boots on his feet, and take his gun from the safe. As he tucked it into its holster on his belt, he realized that Commodore Leigh probably hadn’t gotten himself a new sidearm, and a shiver of fear went through him. But that didn’t stop him moving, and he was already out his door, dialing his phone to get a taxi, and then calling Hilde to tell her the news.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was standing under the awning in front of his apartment and waiting for his taxi, barely shielded from the rain that cascaded down when Hilde picked up the phone. She was groggy, but she too knew that there was no good reason for a phone call in the middle of the night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sieg,” she said. “What’s happening? Are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Kaiser died,” he said. “Wake up your father, and anybody else. Commodore Leigh told me to go to you, to make sure you and your father are safe. It’s going to be dangerous for Braunschweig’s allies if they don’t get off Odin right away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence from the other end of the line as Hilde processed the information. “I should get to the Braunschweig house,” she said. “That’s where we should go. We’ll leave the planet with them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t go anywhere,” Kircheis said. “Not until I get to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But if we need to hurry we should hurry. We can meet you there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis knew that the reason Leigh had told him to go to the Mariendorf house was so that Count Mariendorf could order Kircheis to protect Hilde. That was one of the things Leigh had taken away from Hilde’s time in Castrop’s captivity. But Hilde wouldn’t accept that as an excuse, so Kircheis said, “I don’t want to get separated. The Braunschweigs have already probably left their house and are headed somewhere safe temporarily. When I get to you, Leigh can tell us what we need to do. The situation is probably changing by the minute.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long will it take for you to get here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think many people know what’s happening yet,” Kircheis said as he looked down the street. He could see the lights of the taxi coming towards him. “The roads are still clear. Give me twenty minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know what Hank is doing? And Maggie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He didn’t say. But Leigh will take care of her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll wake up my father,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be there soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sieg—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will.” He hung up as the taxi pulled up to the curb in front of him.</span>

  <em>
    <span>October 488 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though it was the middle of the night, the Braunschweig house was in total chaos when Yang arrived. He wasn’t surprised by that, but it was one thing to expect it, and another thing to see it in the flesh. It was pouring rain outside, though that didn’t stop Braunschweig’s small personal contingent of soldiers and large staff of servants from running back and forth on the lawn. They were removing all the most essential items from the house and putting them out front in rows. Everything needed to be loaded onto Duke Braunschweig’s personal ship, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, which should soon be en route from the airfield at which it was moored. All the house’s lights were on, and they illuminated the normally perfect lawn as the running of people back and forth tore the grass into muddy pits.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach stood in the rain, half yelling to direct the movement, and half speaking urgently into the phone that he kept squeezed between his ear and his shoulder so that he could have both his hands free to point and carry things. As Yang walked up the driveway, Ansbach stomped over to one soldier emerging from the house. The soldier had stacked two heavy boxes on top of each other, and Ansbach took the top one before it toppled over and fell. Lopsidedly, he carried it over to its correct spot on the lawn. When he put the box down, he looked up and saw Yang. He hung up his phone call.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re here,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you think I wouldn’t be?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach looked behind Yang at the car that was swiftly departing the Braunschweig house. “Just you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My wife is going to stay with her mother for now, and I sent Lieutenant Kircheis to go find Count Mariendorf. It’s just me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Ansbach said. “Are you prepared to go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. Every plan he written had been either already put into action, or was too late to enact now. He didn’t have much in the way of possessions that he needed to take with him. It was strange— he had arrived on Odin with nothing but the clothes on his back once, and it seemed like he was about to leave it in almost the same fashion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re wanted inside,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Her Majesty is apparently wondering where you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the title for Elizabeth. “She hasn’t been crowned yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’d better watch your mouth,” Ansbach said, but there wasn’t enough venom in it— he was too distracted, and the idea of Elizabeth as the nation’s first kaiserin probably felt just as alien and funny to him as it did to Yang, albeit for different reasons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang hurried inside, though it was far too late to stop himself from being soaked, and he dripped his way through the house. For all the chaos outside, the interior, with all its dark wood, was still trapped in the quiet stillness of the night, once Yang left the front hall and headed towards the duke’s office. He passed the library, and saw that the door had been propped open, so he glanced inside as he walked by— and then stopped in his tracks when he saw Elizabeth standing alone by the window, watching the chaos outside through the curtains of rain. He knocked on the door to get her attention, and then came in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was told you were looking for me,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t turn around immediately, but she could easily gauge his relative lack of formality by his tone. “You’d better bow,” she said. “My father will make sure of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But will you make sure, Your Majesty?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She did turn around, then. He still didn’t bow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where is Fraulein Mariendorf?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you want to know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She narrowed her eyes at him for a moment. “Bring her here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No? I’m not sure you’re in the position to refuse orders, Commodore Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps it was for the best that they were having a confrontation immediately. If Elizabeth wanted to flex her authority, Yang was a safe person for her to test it on. Ordering her father around would not get her far, and they both knew it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you want her here?” Yang asked. “I’m certain that her father believes she will be safer remaining on Odin, rather than traveling with either him or yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I not allowed to have my advisors?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Fraulein Mariendorf arrives under her own power, I doubt anyone would have an objection to her staying,” Yang said. “But your father would not jeopardize his alliance with Count Mariendorf by dragging his daughter onto the front lines for your sake. Nor would I.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wrinkled her nose in childish, obvious displeasure, but she didn’t argue. She was probably tired and still in mild shock, since it was the middle of the night and it would take some time for her to really grasp her new station. This was what prevented an argument, Yang was sure. But he wouldn’t push it too far.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just a little further.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I ask a question, Your Majesty?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What matters would you expect her to advise you on while we head out into space?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her gaze became a glare. “What does it matter to you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope that I might be able to serve as a poor substitute for Fraulein Mariendorf, since I’ve been her teacher for many years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She curled her lip. “You’re my father’s advisor, not mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I say one more thing, Your Majesty?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was silent, which Yang took as permission. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll say to you the same thing I said to your grandfather more than once. I am a servant of all the people of the Empire— and by the transitive property, that makes me your servant too, even if only a humble one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth rolled her eyes. “If that line worked on my grandfather, it won’t work on me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if there is any opportunity for me to be useful to you, I hope that you do not hesitate to tell me. There are some benefits of being your father’s advisor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Such as?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since he controls my paycheck, he at least knows the value of taking me seriously.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This unexpected joke made Elizabeth laugh. “You hardly need a paycheck. My grandfather took care of that for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t work for free,” Yang said, and his affrontedness was only half-feigned. “I said I’m a servant, not a slave. There’s dignity in getting a paycheck— my father impressed that on me at a very young age.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head and turned back to the window. “I’m afraid I will simply lack for pleasant company,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Vering is not enough company for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He lacks the feminine grace to make good conversation. At least least enough to entertain me until it’s safe to return home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When I next see Fraulein Mariendorf, I’ll be sure to pass along that you think she’s a good conversationalist.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do that,” Elizabeth said. “I’m sure she’d appreciate the compliment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was something in her voice that made Yang change his mind immediately, but he still gave her his placid smile. “Are you ready to leave?” he asked</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It hardly makes a difference if I’m ready,” she said. “We’re leaving regardless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s true,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you ready, Commodore Leigh?” There was more in her voice than simple concern for him— in fact, there was none of that at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Your Majesty,” Yang said. He tried to put as much calm honesty into his voice as he could, even if calm and honest were not things he had felt for a long time. Even if her tone was one of demanding answers about strategy, and about victory— Yang could see how small she was, standing at the window. She was half his age, and she would come out of this with either half the galaxy on her shoulders, or dead. She could keep her voice cool, but he suspected that she wanted reassurance, of the kind she might have wanted from Hilde. He could give her that. “We’re ready.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded, and that was a dismissal. He slipped out of the library.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yang ended up caught in the flurry of activity around the Braunschweig manor for quite some time. He had texted his various allies who remained on Odin during his car ride to the Braunschweig house, but since he was sending warning messages to so many people, he hadn’t had a chance to call anyone other than Kircheis. Yang slipped away from where Duke Braunschweig was surveying the scene from the front hall, sneaking down the back of the house and out towards the yard where he had once spoken with Ansbach, down near the servants’ hall. There was no one there, since all of the servants were hurriedly engaged in getting the house ready to leave, and so Yang had some privacy there in the very early hours of the October morning. He stood beneath the lip of the roof, and the bulk of the house made sure the wind didn’t toss the drops at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shivered in the cold, and rubbed his hands together before he pulled his phone from his pocket and dialed Reuenthal’s number with shaky hands. The adrenaline from having woken up in the middle of the night had long since worn off, and it was tiredness that quavered Yang’s limbs now. Reuenthal picked up on the second ring.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are you?” Reuenthal asked, before Yang could even say a word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Braunschweig house,” Yang said. “We’ll be leaving the planet as soon as the duke’s ship arrives.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence from Reuenthal. In that empty space, Yang had to wonder what he was thinking. Well, he didn’t have to wonder. He knew Reuenthal well enough. Reuenthal didn’t want to stay on Odin, but there was no way he could come with the Braunschweig family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you tell me where you’re going?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Geiersburg,” Yang said. “Most of the duke’s pledged-troops” —those that could be called upon by the crown— “are stationed there. We’ll meet up with his forces he’s calling up from his own lands, and then we’ll take the fortress as a base.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And then you’ll return to Odin with a fleet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope so,” Yang said. “I don’t want to do anything else if we can help it. But it depends on how it all goes. I’m sure that this will be our first stop.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will I be able to join you then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a simple question, but it didn’t have a simple answer. “If we can get to the ground, then it will all be over. If we can’t—” There wouldn’t be any way for Reuenthal to get off the planet, nor any reason for him to do so. They both knew that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want me to do?” Reuenthal asked. There wasn’t any rancor in his words at being refused, but the calmness of Reuenthal’s voice was often deceptive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lieutenant Kircheis has a lot of information, and he’s staying on Odin, I think. Unless he gets here in the next five minutes,” Yang said, trailing off into mumbles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> In the sky, visible now through the rainclouds, Yang could see a distant light growing larger and closer— Duke Braunschweig’s personal ship, breaking through the fog. He shook himself out of his reverie watching it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang continued. “Meet up with him and Oberstein. I don’t know what’s going to happen on Odin enough to plan for it entirely, but… he has what I’ve given him, at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Reuenthal—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please stay safe,” Yang said. “Before anything else. Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was silence again from the other end of the line. This time, Yang had no idea what Reuenthal was thinking. Or if he did, he didn’t want to put words to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should I get in contact with Mittermeyer?” Reuenthal finally asked. “Tell him to meet you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “At least not yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not? He has ships, unlike me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Half-built ones,” Yang pointed out. Mittermeyer had been shuffled off Odin early in the summer, his duties changed to include overseeing the building of the first few ships in a new class, at a shipbuilding station far from Odin. This posting had annoyed Muckenburger, since it was a real thing for Mittermeyer to be working on, but Admiral Schaft, Mittermeyer’s direct superior, had assigned him there when the previous holder of the position had retired. Mittermeyer hated it, predictably. But even if Muckenburger was annoyed, it wasn’t like Mittermeyer’s micro-fleet of under-construction ships could do much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He would want to be useful to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang closed his eyes. The ship in the sky was coming closer and closer. He could hear the drone of its engines now. If Mittermeyer stayed out of things, no matter what the eventual outcome of the civil war was, he would live through it. But Reuenthal wouldn’t like that answer, and neither would Mittermeyer if he heard it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want him to come to Odin,” Yang said. “There wouldn’t be any benefit in it— if anything, it would be a waste of a surprise element we might need later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This shouldn’t take too long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh? You expect to win quickly?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like to,” Yang said. “But even if I don’t— there’s only so long either side can sustain a full force, especially if everything has fallen apart around the Empire. It can’t go on more than a year. If it does, even if we’re still fighting it out, we’ll be too weak to fend off the rebels. And they’re going to be waiting for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal made a non-commital noise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If it gets that bad,” Yang said, “hopefully I will have Iserlohn, and can make a deal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You probably shouldn’t be talking so loudly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang glanced around— he was still totally alone in the yard, but now the ship was right overhead, slowly descending down to the front of the Braunschweig mansion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should go,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t keep you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I can, I’ll contact you when we’re back at Odin,” Yang said. “I’ll do my best.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did I say that you wouldn’t?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oskar—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silence from Reuenthal’s side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked around again. The ship’s lights on the other side of the house were catching on the falling raindrops and illuminating the sky to an eerie, almost daylight brightness. “I love you,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could hear Reuenthal breathing. “Isn’t your phone still tapped, Hank?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang smiled, despite everything. “I don’t think I care anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then goodbye, Wen-li,” Reuenthal said, almost quietly enough that Yang couldn’t make out the name. He felt an overwhelming warmth in his heart, enough to make it hard to speak through the choke of emotion rising up through his throat. By the time he had figured out what he wanted to say to Reuenthal, he had hung up.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The journey to Geiersburg Fortress was not particularly long. The fortress was about halfway between Duke Braunschweig’s owned territory and the capital, further back into the heartland of the Empire, away from the Iserlohn and Phezzan corridors. Throughout the journey, Duke Braunschweig was in very high spirits, and this was a contagious feeling for some of his family members. Baron Flegel seemed cheerful, anyway. Of the two women on board, Princess Amarie and Kaserin Elizabeth, it was impossible to tell if their smiles and laughter in the presence of the duke were sincere. Both of them were very good actors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For his own part, Yang ended up in a little informal cadre made of three people: himself, Admiral Merkatz, and Count Mariendorf. Both the count and the admiral had joined Braunschweig at his house before his ship departed, having made arrangements to do so beforehand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Count Mariendorf and Admiral Merkatz knew each other from simply being in the same general social sphere, but they both knew Yang better, so he found himself in the odd position of being looked to by two people he respected. Yang would have invited Ansbach into this little circle, but Ansbach was glued to the duke’s side, a position that Yang did not envy in the least. It wasn’t clear that Ansbach would have accepted such an invitation, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In any event, the duke’s cheer didn’t quite make it as far as Count Mariendorf and Admiral Merkatz. Both of them were serious men, and found it difficult to laugh at a future that they couldn’t see. Yang couldn’t help but agree with them. The civil war, even if they won easily, would have a human cost that weighed on him heavily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both men were concerned about their families back on Odin, though they didn’t speak of it much. Hilde had remained behind, as Yang had known she would, even if she had wanted to come. Merkatz’s wife had gone to stay with his daughter and son-in-law’s family, who had a country home. Yang said that so far away from the city, there probably wouldn’t be too much chaos, which seemed somewhat reassuring to Merkatz, though this was hard to tell— he always had such an unflappable facade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Merkatz still outranked Yang significantly, now that he was a flag officer, it was easier for them to speak as relative equals. Merkatz had always respected Yang’s tactical abilities, but now they spent long hours poring over Yang’s plans, both for Geiersburg and for the larger civil war. The only thing that Yang held back from Merkatz was the plan for Iserlohn. He suspected that Merkatz would have ideological trouble going through with it, if it wasn’t of dire need. There was no point in bringing up something that looked like a defeatist plan early.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s ship </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> met up with his small contingent of vessels that had come from his home territories. Yang considered it very lucky that the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin </span>
  </em>
  <span>had been able to make it away from Odin without being chased or hunted down by any of Littenheim’s allied ships. Even if the fleet that Braunschweig had managed to gather was only some thousand ships strong, it was still so much more secure than traveling alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig had many soldiers under his command, but the majority were those in his personal territories, including most of his ground troops, which were required to remain where they were to prevent Littenheim from launching an attack on the Braunschweig homelands that could halt a forward advance to Odin. The remainder of his soldiers were those pledged for the crown’s use, and they were stationed primarily at Geiersburg. This would be Braunschweig’s main fighting force for the rest of the civil war, if they could join up with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig appointed Merkatz to be the commander of his fleet, which reassured Yang more than anything else. Flegel had been jockeying for the position, in his needling way, but there was nothing anyone could say to deny that Merkatz had more experience as an actual commander. Flegel was promised his own section of the eventual full fleet, which appeased him a little, especially since neither Yang nor Ansbach were given ships of their own. This suited Yang fine; he had no desire to command directly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the last day before they made it to Geiersburg, Yang needed to speak with Braunschweig, to confirm the timeline of their planned attack. Merkatz had gone off onto a different ship which would serve as his temporary flag. The </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, since it was still carrying the precious cargo of Elizabeth, would need to hang back in the battle— and so Yang was serving as an unofficial go-between to coordinate everything. He got the sense that Merkatz and Braunschweig barely tolerated each other, and their working relationship would be better the less they saw of each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He found Braunschweig in his richly appointed lounge, sitting on one of the couches, with Baron Flegel next to him, and Ansbach sitting across from him. Ansbach looked cool and collected, but Braunschweig was leaning forward over the coffee table where there was an ornate chessboard set up. Ansbach was playing white, and it seemed that Flegel and Braunschweig were playing together as black, though Yang had to wonder how much Flegel was helping rather than hindering. The game was already well underway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Yang walked in, Flegel looked up and said, “Oh, good, you can help Ansbach lose.” His uncle simultaneously picked up a pawn and moved it forward two spaces.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I’m terrible at chess,” Yang said. But he came to sit down anyway, perching on the arm of the couch where Ansbach sat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach barely looked up at Yang, but a slight twitch of a frown crossed his face. For once, Yang couldn’t tell if it was because of him, or because of the move Braunschweig had just made. His hand hovered over his bishop, considering moving it back from where it was now being threatened by the black pawn, but instead he moved his knight to capture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel pointed at the board, where one of Braunschweig’s remaining pawns could take the knight. “See?” he crowed, as his uncle followed his instructions and captured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silently, Ansbach struck back with his bishop and took this pawn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was it you wanted?” Braunschweig finally asked, not taking his eyes off the board to look at Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to talk over our plans for tomorrow, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mm.” The move Braunschweig made on the board, shifting one of his knights around, was inscrutable to Yang. Similarly, the move that Ansbach followed up with— castling— meant little to him. “Talk, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir, are you completely certain that your men in the fortress will have the ability to disable Geiersburg’s main gun?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel whispered something in his uncle’s ear, but Braunschweig had no outward change in facial expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m certain. Does Merkatz doubt it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir. I just would like to be careful, before we put our entire force within range of the gun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We only have a thousand ships, Leigh. I’m surprised you want to split them.” He was focused on the board, so his tone was one of distraction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to split them, sir. I just want to send in radar decoys first, to see if Geiersburg takes the bait.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Braunschweig said, without looking up from the board. “We’re moving in as quickly as possible. We’re sitting targets for Littenheim’s fleet if we don’t get into that fortress. And don’t bother telling me that this ship should remain behind by itself. We were lucky to even survive getting off Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It shouldn’t take long to test if they will fire, sir,” Yang tried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if they don’t take the bait? I said no, Commodore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The game was continuing, but Yang wasn’t following the moves until Flegel pointed out that Braunschweig should try to take Ansbach’s queen— though Braunschweig had just moved, and so Ansbach was presumably about to move his queen to safety. Ansbach had no reaction to this happening, and leaned back in his seat to listen to Yang. Braunschweig did the same, and so the game was paused for a moment. Now that Braunschweig was looking up at Yang rather than down at the board, he could see some of the tension held in the crease of his forehead, not quite a scowl, but almost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think we need any of your tricks,” Flegel said dismissively. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you have some other suggestion, tell me quickly,” Braunschweig said. His eyes kept flicking to the chessboard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang ran his hand through his hair. “Fine, sir. If we have to go in quickly— I’m not suggesting that we stay split up, but I do suggest that as we initially enter the gun’s range, we should spread thinly, and deploy radar decoys in between our ships. When we’re still that far out, the gun can only target a tiny angle, and if it fires on us, we’ll… lose a minimum of men.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if it doesn’t?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then we’ll proceed towards the fortress and group back up as we come closer,” Yang said. He was much more worried about if the gun did fire on them, but Braunschweig seemed to consider that a non-issue. Yang wasn’t sure he was so trusting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>sure that the fleet would not deploy. Of the sixteen thousand ships or so in the bays of Geiersburg, twelve thousand belonged to Duke Braunschweig outright. If the fortress command ordered the fleet out, then most of those ships would likely immediately join the duke. So, the fortress’s only defense was its main gun, its liquid metal armor, and its floating gun turrets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And we’ll take out the floating turrets as we planned,” Flegel said. “I’m sure they won’t be an issue for our Valkyries.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, if we can get close enough to deploy them,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m certain that we can,” Braunschweig said. “Was that all, Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you don’t want to discuss alternatives, in case we are fired upon, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can discuss alternatives if we need to. If we’re fired on, we’ll retreat out of range and regroup”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Yang said. He started to get up to leave as Braunschweig turned back to the chessboard, but Ansbach stopped him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Give me a moment to finish this game, Count von Leigh. I’d like to talk to you about the plan to breach the fortress, once the gun turrets have been taken care of,” Ansbach said. Yang could tell this was not what Ansbach wanted to talk about— their plan for physically entering the fortress had been hashed out long in advance, and it was one of the things Yang felt most confident about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Yang said, and he sat back down on the arm of the couch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach pushed his bishop across the board, took Braunschweig’s rook. Braunschweig was forced to follow that up by using his knight to capture the bishop, since his king was in danger. Ansbach moved his queen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Check,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Move your knight,” Flegel said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig did, without comment, and took the queen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re up in material now,” Flegel said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Ansbach moved his rook all the way across the board. “Mate,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on,” Flegel whined. It was true. Ansbach’s bishop was simultaneously pinning down the king in concert with the rook. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good game, my lord,” Ansbach said. Braunschweig leaned back in his seat, though still studying the board.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, good game.” Braunschweig waved Ansbach off, and together he and Yang made their way into the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you want to go to your office?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Ansbach said. “Here is fine. This won’t take long.” Although they got along better, these days, the scowl in Ansbach’s voice when he addressed Yang was habitual. Yang didn’t mind it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They spoke quietly, not loud enough to be heard by anyone who might happen to pass by the corner and see them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t about the boarding party, is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think we’re going to get hit,” Ansbach said flatly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think it’s worth considering. I don’t personally care if we lose this war before we even fire a single shot, but I’d prefer not to be blasted out of the sky tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach made a derisive noise. “You need to keep your mouth shut.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d just like to be prepared for the idea that his agents haven’t managed to disable the gun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If we get shot at, what next?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’ll aim for our midsection,” Yang said. “Just to maximize their chance of hitting us at all, from this big of a firing distance. We should put most of our decoys in the center of our formation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t think they’ll bait us in closer by not firing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t think it’s likely. That’s why I figured we might be able to bait them out with decoys. Anyone in that fortress command wants to defeat us before the rank and file figure out that we’re even there. If there’s some kind of rebellion within the fortress for our side, they won’t be able to contain it for very long. They need to shoot us down fast if they want to stop that from happening. Well, if it happens anyway. I know Braunschweig sent agents there to organize something like that, but I don’t know if they’ll even be successful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But even if nothing happens inside the fortress, I’m sure that the fortress command are aware of the possibility of sabotage. I certainly would be. They’re going to want to test their gun on us as soon as possible, so that if it’s not working, they can come up with some kind of plan. Ideally they’ll surrender, but…” Yang rubbed at the back of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re deluding yourself if you think they will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I know,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You keep dodging the question. If we do get fired on…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We either wait until the fortress collapses from the inside, or…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or what? Braunschweig doesn’t like waiting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to render the fortress unusable,” Yang said. “That would defeat the purpose of capturing it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are full of yourself. Tell me your idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked over Ansbach’s left shoulder, down the empty hallway. In a rather dead voice, he said, “The gun can melt ships into slag, even vaporize them at close range, but the light-pressure of it isn’t enough to halt their momentum, even if they’re husks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can capture a large asteroid. Sacrifice a few ships to push it. Unmanned. If they accelerate from outside the range of the gun, stay behind the rock, they can move it up to speed, maybe even keep accelerating within the gun’s range, for a while. Even if the front half gets vaporized, if it’s a big enough rock, even Geiersburg’s gun won’t be able to get through the whole thing. And if it’s pointed directly at the fortress, that kind of mass moving at speed can’t be budged by the beam gun. It will hit, and will take out whatever’s behind it. To move it, they’d have to slam their own ships into it, even to just divert it. And if they open those doors—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach was silent for a moment. “And you think this will work?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright. I’ll make sure this ship is far back, and in one of the flanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Yang said. Ansbach turned to go. “One question—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When did you know you were going to beat him? In the chess game, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>decided </span>
  </em>
  <span>to win as soon as Baron Flegel walked in the door.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang let out a huff of a laugh. “When should he have resigned, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably when I refused his queen trade,” Ansbach said. “But he never resigns. It’s not like him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yang explained his alternate plans to Merkatz, who quickly dispatched a few ships to find and gather a suitable asteroid for their purposes. Although on a map, it appeared that Geiersburg was in the middle of empty space, it was situated along one of the major routes that ships could use to travel faster-than-light through the Empire, where the strings of gravity formed channels for ships’ engines to cut their ways through. Long ago— many billions of years, Yang supposed— this part of the galaxy had held a star system, or something that might have tried to form a star system. Now there was only cold rubble, sparse through space, but it was massive enough to draw those invisible lines of force closer together. And it was plentiful enough that it was easy to find a suitable chunk of rock, one that even two strikes from Geiersburg’s main gun wouldn’t be able to vaporize entirely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz understood why Yang had wanted to have Braunschweig put this plan into place early. Geiersburg’s main gun had a range of six hundred thousand kilometers. Light could travel that distance in about two seconds, but there was no way they could use their ships’ sub-light engines to accelerate a rock anywhere close to that speed, and there was no way to use their superluminal gravity engines to push a rock in concert like that. They wouldn’t be able to drop it back down to sub-light speeds. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the rock didn’t need to be moving faster than light. They didn’t even have to get it up to one percent of the speed of light. Yang could make do with something around 1/500th of lightspeed— six hundred kilometers per second. It was still a speed that was unfathomably fast, but it was well within the limits of the engines of their ships. If the rock was approaching Geiersburg at that speed, it would arrive in about sixteen minutes. Geiersburg’s main gun could only fully charge and fire once every ten minutes. Yang’s rock, if it was big enough, wouldn’t be vaporized in two hits. Even he could do that math. And a rock that size, solid, moving at that speed, would cripple the fortress, even if Yang aimed it to only do the most glancing blow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He really did not want to put this plan in action, but if the fortress was firing on them with its main gun, he didn’t see much of another way to disable it, not with their tiny fleet. He couldn’t count on there being any breaking ranks within the fortress itself. Yang lacked Braunschweig’s confidence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even Merkatz was skeptical of their chances of not being fired on, and he made his own preparations to get out of Geiersburg’s range quickly, should they come under attack.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the time came for their advance, Merkatz arranged the fleet. As Yang had suggested, he bulked out their visible numbers by preparing to deploy radar decoys in between their ranks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though this made their fleet look twice as large, spread out in a wide band across the stars, it could still only look like a paltry two-thousand-strong fleet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz’s contribution to the fleet arrangement, his own paranoia about being able to escape Geiersburg’s gun, was visible on the screen now. Since there was no chance that they were about to meet another fleet in battle, Merkatz could perform a rather esoteric fleet maneuver— the kind of thing that was run as a drill more than it would ever see battle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This whole exercise was turning out to be one of playing with Newton’s laws. Before the fleet entered Geiersburg’s attack radius, they accelerated, then stopped accelerating, cruising under their momentum. Without changing their paths or their speed, Merkatz ordered all the ships to turn around. They were flying, unpowered and backwards, into Geiersburg’s territory. If they were fired upon, this would give them the maximum ability to retreat quickly, to get out of range before a second shot could go off and critically disable the fleet. They wouldn’t have to waste precious time turning around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone in Geiersburg is laughing at us right now,” Yang muttered to himself as he leaned against the wall on the bridge of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, watching the big screen at the front of the room, standing well back from Braunschweig in the main chair. Ansbach, who happened to be walking past Yang at that moment, gave him a glare. Yang returned a sheepish smile, though he didn’t really feel like smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t you go make yourself useful?” Ansbach said under his breath, pretending to look at a nearby console.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am useful,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re about as useful as him.” Ansbach gave a slight nod over to Lieutenant Commander Hans von Vering, who was also standing around the bridge of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> . He seemed to have little understanding of what was going on, and was anxiously moving back and forth between several operator stations on the bridge, bothering the men manning them. Braunschweig and Flegel were both watching this movement with annoyance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this your way of telling me to get rid of him?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Be delicate about it. If you’re capable of that.” And Ansbach headed back over the center of the room to report to Braunschweig.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang sighed and stuck his hands in his pockets, then wandered over to where Vering was haunting the poor radar operator, leaning over his shoulder and breathing down his neck to look at the dots of ships on the screen, as though they meant anything to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lieutenant Commander Vering,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering jerked up, not having realized that Yang was there. When he realized who was addressing him, he scowled a little. “What do you need, sir?” he said, with some reluctance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was wondering if you might walk with me,” Yang said. “I need to speak with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is not a matter for the bridge,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering looked around, hoping that Duke Braunschweig or Flegel would step in to save him from needing to leave with Yang, but the duke and baron were engaged in a discussion behind the audio privacy screen, and they were paying no attention to Yang. Even if they had been, Yang suspected that they were as eager to get Vering off the bridge as Ansbach had been. Neither of them particularly liked Elizabeth’s future husband.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though the person giving the order was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Yang</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Vering couldn’t actually refuse it, so he followed Yang out of the bridge. Yang didn’t say anything as they walked through the hallways for a minute, until Vering finally spoke up, in an annoyed voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was it that you wanted to talk to me about, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Yang was almost startled to be addressed. He pulled his hands out of his pockets so that he could rub at the back of his head. “I just thought that Her Majesty might like your company. This is a very delicate time, and she’s never been on the battlefield before. It seemed to me that it would be prudent of you to provide her some reassurance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is she asking for me?” Was his voice hopeful?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, er, she’s not really the type to ask for something like that. But if you’re going to marry her, well…” He trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what am I supposed to say to her?” Vering asked. “It’s not even like we’re in the middle of the action. It’s not even like there </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> action. We’re on the flank, and we’re not even really moving.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re moving, Lieutenant Commander.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering scowled. They were coming close to the personal quarters of the Braunschweig family, and Yang had absolutely no compunctions about ringing the bell. He stood loosely, with his hands at his side, while next to him Vering was stiff, and smoothed down his light colored hair with an anxious hand. He fiddled with his uniform, and was tugging his jacket into place when the door finally opened, revealing Princess Amarie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering bowed, Yang did not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hans… and Count von Leigh, what a surprise to see you both,” Amarie said. Her tone was inscrutable. “I had assumed everyone in uniform would be far too busy to come pay visits.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, my job is mostly done, at this point,” Yang said. “It’s up to everyone else now. But it’s actually Her Majesty that the lieutenant commander has come to see. I’ve just been providing him an escort.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Amarie clearly understood that Vering was about to become her problem. She smiled. “An escort? I find it hard to believe that such a thing would be necessary. Please, come in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, my lady.” Yang did incline his head politely as he stepped past her into her family’s quarters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the interior of a ship, their quarters were luxe. There were lush green houseplants in pots and along the walls, some in bloom, which cheered the space. The furniture was heavy wood, not like the light fiberglass and plastic that was found in the staff quarters. The lights were warm, and the air smelled fresher and cleaner than the rest of the ship. At the far end of the living room area, there was a huge plate window, one that looked out over the battlefield. Elizabeth sat sideways to this view with an embroidery hoop on her lap. Her needle moved down and out of the fabric with a machine-like force and precision, continuing its motion even as she looked up at her guests.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought my father considered you indispensable, Hans,” Elizabeth said. She nodded at Yang, who gave a shallow bow, then wandered over to the window to look out. Amarie sat back down on the armchair across from the couch and watched the other three with an eagle eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been dispensed with,” Vering said. He sat down on the couch next to Elizabeth. “Or I’ve been told that I would provide greater value here, as your future husband. To reassure you about what’s happening.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We seem to be moving backwards,” Elizabeth said. “This window looks out over the aft of the ship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An astute observation,” Vering said, puffing himself up. “Admiral Merkatz is doing something strange with the fleet arrangement. I’m surprised that your father allowed the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> to go along with it. Especially with us out in the flank.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth looked up at Yang, who was scanning the black sky outside for the tiny dot that was Geiersburg. “Is this your plan?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “Admiral Merkatz decided the specifics of the fleet movement. I only advised.” He found the tiny dot among the stars, fixed it in his vision, and pointed it out. “There’s Geiersburg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth stood up from the couch, passing her embroidery off to her fiancee, who looked down at it. The picture was of a bouquet of roses, half done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why are we spread out so far? In photos of other battles, I’ve never seen gaps like that in the line,” Elizabeth said as she stood next to Yang at the window. He couldn’t help but feel a little pleased that she was asking him. Not because she was the kaiserin, but because he enjoyed being a teacher.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To the fortress, it doesn’t look like there are any holes,” Yang said. “We’ve deployed radar decoys to make our fleet look bigger than it is. They’re too small for you to see with the naked eye from here, but they look just like ships to someone looking at radar far away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long until we’re in range of the fortress?” Vering asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This caused Amarie to speak up. “Elizabeth, why don’t you sit down? You’re making me nervous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nervous?” Elizabeth asked. “I’m just standing here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang checked his watch. “Six minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Commodore, may I speak with you for a second?” Amarie asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He followed her one room over, into a private dining room, and she she shut the door behind her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here, Commodore?” she asked. All pleasantries were gone from her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t need him to tell her the obvious reason for escorting Vering over. “Don’t you think that the leader of the Empire should know something about how the business of the Empire is conducted?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She doesn’t need to worry about this. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> don’t need to worry about this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was unusual that Amarie was showing him this moment of weakness. It was unlike her. He wondered what the purpose of it was. Amarie always had some kind of purpose. She probably just didn’t want him too close to her daughter. Yang wished briefly that Hilde was here— she could have filled Yang’s role, and he was sure that Amarie would have no objection to her explaining the motions of ships.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he tried to keep his voice gentle. “For some people, knowing what’s happening is better than being kept in the dark.” When Amarie pursed her lips, Yang added, “I’m not trying to overstep my place. But I think that the Empire is safer in the hands of someone who knows what they’re doing, and she’s willing to learn. That’s a quality that I’ve never wanted to stifle in a student, no matter who they are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My daughter is not a soldier, and doesn’t need to be taught to be one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then let me provide an explanation for Herr Vering’s sake, since you expect him to take on this duty for your daughter in the future.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Amarie shouldn’t have let herself be backed into that corner. “I assume that she and I will never have occasion to be part of an active battle again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I doubt that you will be,” Yang said. “It would be very stupid to put either of you in danger unless it is absolutely necessary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why are we here, Commodore?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think that I suggested bringing you to the front lines?” Yang asked, incredulous.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could have suggested putting us on a different ship to hang back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ansbach tried to say that. Did </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>bring it up with the duke?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her lip curled. “You may stay. Just this once.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do not overstep your place, Commodore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They returned to the main living area. Elizabeth was still standing by the window, but Vering had shifted to drape himself on the arm of the couch, leaning sideways to put himself as close to her as he could get without getting up. Her embroidery lay abandoned on the coffee table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re coming close to Geiersburg’s range,” Yang said as he stepped back up towards Elizabeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do they know we’re here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unless someone sabotaged all of their sensors, yes, I’m sure that they do. Even with a small fleet, we’re presenting a large enough face for them to detect. A single ship might slip by unseen at this distance, but not what looks like two thousand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will they fire at us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was silent for a moment. “I hope not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will I be able to see it, if they do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t see it coming,” Yang said. “It’s a beam cannon, and light can’t travel faster than itself for us to see it before it gets here. So the first you’ll see is it hitting us.” His voice filled the silence of the room, just over the whirr of the air filters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not visible light,” he continued. “Geiersburg’s cannon is in ultraviolet. Any light you see will be from the things it hits. The metal of the ships will glow before they’re vaporized. This window should block out the brightest parts of it. Every window on a ship has to be able to shield out a whole star’s worth of radiation. So you don’t have to close your eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded, and stared out into space, at the distant dot of Geiersburg. Maybe they couldn’t actually see it from here. Maybe that was just a dim star that Yang had pointed out by mistake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang checked his watch, and gave a muttered countdown to the time when they would cross the threshold. The time of entering Geiersburg’s range came and passed. The two seconds it would have taken for the beam to arrive ticked by with nothing to mark their going. The ships continued to slide under their momentum towards Geiersburg.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are we safe?” Vering asked from the couch, a tense three minutes of silence later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t answer the question. He suddenly felt just as helpless as he was sure Elizabeth did. He wanted to be back on the bridge, where he was sure that Braunschweig, now feeling like the worst of danger had passed, would be calling up Merkatz and demanding that all the ships turn back around and accelerate towards the fortress. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Just wait a few more minutes,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Yang thought. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Please.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He had said that the fortress wouldn’t bait them in, and he still thought that. But there was a chance that it wasn’t bait— that it was just taking longer to aim and fire than Yang had anticipated. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The gravity engines of the ship were also what made the ship’s acceleration impossible to feel from the inside, so Yang only saw the field of stars start to swing as the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin </span>
  </em>
  <span>began turning. Ships turned slowly. Painfully slowly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were on the left flank, and the ship swung counterclockwise, momentarily aligning the aft-facing window with the rest of the fleet. Yang could see them all beginning to turn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was at that moment that a blinding light filled his entire field of view. Geiersburg’s gun, finding its target— the ships in the center of their formation becoming little suns under the onslaught. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was silent. Yang didn’t know why he felt like it should make a noise. There was no sound except the hum of their own ship, completely untouched. Yang, despite his own advice to Elizabeth, closed his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth stumbled forward as if struck, and steadied herself with her hands splayed on the glass of the window. Behind Yang, Vering exclaimed, “What the fuck?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As glow faded behind Yang’s eyelids, he still took a moment before he opened them to survey the damage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They can’t fire again for ten minutes,” Yang said. “We should be able to retreat.” Even as he said this, he could feel the subtle shift of gravity beneath his feet, signaling the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>’s engines fighting to dampen the feeling of acceleration as the ship hurried to move. The stars spun dizzyingly outside, and Yang only caught a glimpse of the gaping hole that had been left in their formation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you tell him that we shouldn’t advance, Commodore?” Amarie asked from somewhere behind Yang. He felt dizzy. It was hard to pinpoint where her voice was coming from. Everything seemed to spinning and swirling around him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How many ships was that?” Elizabeth asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Yang said. “I need to go to the bridge.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stumbled past Elizabeth and ran out of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even though it was chaotic on the bridge, Yang was relieved beyond words to find out that Merkatz was still alive and was coordinating the retreat. The fleet was in disarray, which meant that it took too long to get all the ships moving again. It almost took the full ten minutes of Geiersburg’s recharge time on its beam cannon, and, as they retreated, they were fired on again, a second shot that wiped out one of the straggling sections of their fleet. At least this time they kept moving out of range without needing to turn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They finally made it well out of Geiersburg’s firing distance, and then there was time to regroup. In all, they had only lost one hundred ships —a tenth of their fleet— to Geiersburg’s attack, due to how thinly they had been spread out. It was far less of a blow than they had any right to expect, but Yang couldn’t feel happy about that loss of life. He felt guilty—he should have pushed harder for some alternate plan, one that didn’t involve charging headlong into Geiersburg’s range.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once all the ships had been gathered, Merkatz temporarily left his flagship and came to the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, where Yang met him at the shuttle bay. They talked as they walked down towards the wardroom to discuss their next steps.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t give the order to turn around, did you, sir?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I did not,” Merkatz said shortly. “Duke Braunschweig gave the order. I had planned to wait at least a half hour. Time was on our side before they fired on us—we should have been patient.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does the duke understand that countermanding your order cost us lives?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would know that better than I.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your plan is already in place,” Merkatz said. “The asteroid will enter Geiersburg’s range within the next three hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you do me a favor, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz raised one of his bushy eyebrows. “It depends on what it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t call it my plan,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz looked at him, then nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were at the door of the wardroom. Yang steeled himself, then followed Merkatz in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The meeting to discuss the alternate plan was unpleasant. Flegel kept getting out of his seat and stomping back and forth across the front of the room, to deliver menacing statements about what he would do to those who had dared to fire on the true kaiserin. Braunschweig, though he was more subdued, nodded along, and let Flegel take command of the party that was going to board Geiersburg once they had gotten its doors open. Yang and Ansbach’s eyes met across the table when this assignment was given, though Ansbach swiftly looked away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz talked through Yang’s plan without mentioning Yang, or the fact that he had put the plan into action the day before. Braunschweig nodded along to that, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We should give them the opportunity to surrender, and redirect the asteroid ourselves before it arrives,” Yang said. “It would be better to not do any damage to Geiersburg if we can help it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If they fire on it, we won’t be able to change its trajectory,” Ansbach said. “Even if the beam can’t vaporize the entire rock, it will likely fry the communications arrays on the ships pushing it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They won’t surrender,” Braunschweig said. “Not until they’ve tried firing on it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was probably true, but Yang didn’t like it. “We should warn them anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Braunschweig said. “This is war, Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang couldn’t reasonably object more, so he just slid back in his seat.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>This time, Yang stayed on the bridge to watch the action. It was uniquely terrible to see the huge rock on the monitors, pushed by four empty ships, their engines flaring red. With the magnification up so high, the jutting, craggy rock was visible in a horrid clarity. As their cameras tracked it, filling the whole screen at the front of the bridge, it didn’t even seem like it was moving—the only indication of its motion were the specks of stars that flashed past the edge of the video feed. It was traveling far too fast for the human eye to follow, even if it had been close enough to see. It was maybe only a hundredth of Geiersburg’s mass, probably even less, but it was dense, and that density would protect most of its mass from the beam. It was oblong, too, and the pushing ships were at the far end. The beam would have to eat through more than two kilometers of solid rock to completely vaporize it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bridge was a bustle of activity, with everybody looking up from their own stations and consoles to watch the rock speed towards the fortress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They can see it, right?” Flegel asked as the rock crossed the threshold. “They know it’s there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unless their sensors aren’t working right,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needn’t have asked: moments later, the fortress fired. They didn’t see the beam, but they saw its effect on the rock in their magnified view: its front end glowed like it was falling through an atmosphere, and it warped and bubbled, some of it vaporizing, other parts of it just turning into rolling liquid, some of which was pushed back along the rock by the force of the expanding gas. The whole rock was now so hot that what was liquid took a long time to re-solidify.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve lost contact with the ships’ radios,” the man in charge of monitoring the ships pushing the rock said. The rock was no longer accelerating. Presumably, the heat had been so much that it had destroyed the ships, even if they had been shielded from the blast itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After watching the first shot, the whole bridge fell silent. The chatter ceased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s at the halfway point,” someone announced a few minutes later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fortress, as soon as its main gun was charged, fired again. It had just as little impact as it had the first time, though now those waiting outside of its range didn’t have eyes on the front of the rock, only the rear as it sped away from them. The rear was untouched, though lit by an unnatural glow from the other end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on,” Yang said under his breath. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He clenched his fists in his pockets. Now the camera was trained on Geiersburg. Yang hoped desperately that those in the fortress would realize what they had to do in time to actually do it. The rock was on a course to only graze the fortress, so all they had to do was nudge it a tiny, tiny bit, to make it sail harmlessly by. It would only take a few ships throwing themselves at it to move the rock enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At three minutes before impact, on their magnified view, they saw ships emerge from Geiersburg. First a few, then a swarm, then more and more. Perhaps a general evacuation order had been given, or perhaps everyone had decided that imminent destruction was enough to make them disobey orders and leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the chaos of all the ships rising at once and fleeing from the fortress, two broke off from the crowd and sped towards the rock. They were tiny in comparison to it, like minnows beside a whale, but their engines flashed white hot, and they crashed into it with as much force as they could produce. Yang hoped that there hadn’t been any crew on those ships, but he doubted it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was enough, though barely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rock screamed towards Geiersburg and brushed the edge of its liquid metal shell. The force of that impact on the liquid metal vaporized some, and sent other wild spinning droplets glittering and careening off into space. The fortress itself shook, the perfect spherical bubble warping and vibrating and beginning to spin. Even just that tiny touch seemed to be structurally devastating to the fortress’ outer shell, but if it had hit completely, the fortress would have ceased to exist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, in the space around the fortress, a chaotic scrum was breaking out between Braunschweig’s troops, many in number, and the fortress’s neutral guard. It was too messy to be called a battle, since there seemed to be no commander on either side giving orders. It was ship against ship, no one in any formation, as they all tried to dodge the ship-sized globs of liquid metal that were flying off the fortress. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz ordered Braunschweig’s fleet to advance at top speed. Now that the space around the fortress was surrounded by this fracas, and the fortress itself was in complete disarray, there was no chance that the main gun would go off again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time that their fleet had made it to the space around the fortress, the liquid metal shell had stopped writing quite so much, but Braunschweig’s allied forces had won the day, and they let Braunschweig’s ships through. They sailed past a field of debris— wrecked ships, dead ships, globs of liquid metal like huge funhouse mirrors. They reflected the carnage and Braunschweig’s ship alike, distorting the view and making it appear like there were twice as many vessels in the area, peeking out past micro black holes that bent the light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their ships descended into Geiersburg’s bays. Even though the liquid metal appeared smoother on the surface, as they sunk down through it, their ships were pushed to and fro.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they docked, they could see the evidence of the damage that even the glancing blow from the rock had dealt. Some of the ships that had not managed to launch in time had been knocked hard into the walls of the fortress. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had not been ordered to leave the ship and board the fortress, so he didn’t. Braunschweig did, along with Flegel and Ansbach and Hans von Vering. Flegel charged out at the head of a pack of armored soldiers, and Braunschweig walked calmly behind, surrounded by his own guard. Yang watched them go, until they left the view from the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>’s monitors, and then he closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair on the bridge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had won the day, and cost had not been too steep— though any cost tended to weigh heavily on Yang. Their losses had been more than recouped by winning Geiersburg, and the fortress itself wasn’t too damaged by Yang’s plan. Although it looked bad, it didn’t seem in danger of imminent collapse, which meant that the damage could and would be repaired. He listened to the radio chatter, hearing the occasional staticky sound of Merkatz’s voice as he ordered the cleanup and organization to begin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s even breathing and trying to force himself to relax— he had made it through the day whole and alive— almost put him to sleep. But then he heard an unexpected voice say his name, cutting through his mental haze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Startled, he jerked up, and found himself face to face with Elizabeth, who had made it onto the bridge. Perhaps all the junior staff who remained onboard had not felt like contradicting her when she asked to be allowed in, even if it was completely against the usual decorum. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sleeping on duty, Commodore”, she asked. “I should reconsider your paycheck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can dock my pay for sleeping if you want, Your Majesty,” Yang said as he hastened to stand. “But I don’t think it will make much difference,” he added with a yawn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does your mother know you’re wandering through the ship?” he aksed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s sleeping.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m jealous,” Yang said, which made Elizabeth smile despite herself. “Was there something you needed, Your Majesty?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she said. She wandered a few steps away from Yang, tracing her hands along the consoles. “I just thought I’d like to see what’s here, while no one who will say no to a woman being on the bridge is around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look all you like,” Yang said. “It’s not particularly exciting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps,” she said again. Whenever she wandered over to one of the operator stations, the man at it got up uncomfortably and let her sit down at the chair. She was very careful not to push any of the buttons, but she read the labels and looked at the displays with her trademark detached curiosity. For some reason, Yang got the impression that she was killing time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here, Your Majesty?” he asked, as she circled back around the first console she had looked at and started examining it again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father said that he had a gift for me, and he said he’d give it to me when I step into Geiersburg,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really?” Yang asked. “And what type of gift is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. I would like to answer that question myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think that waiting here will get you the answer sooner than being in your quarters?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave him a sidelong look. “Commodore, are you trying to get rid of me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your mother will accuse me of overstepping my bounds by letting you stay here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll tell her I demanded it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang laughed. “Of course, Your Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This only made Elizabeth scowl. “Tell me to leave, then,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang said nothing, and so Elizabeth remained on the bridge, though she stopped feigning interest in the operator stations and instead sat down in the chair at the center of the command dais. Every soldier who walked into the bridge did a double take to see the small teenager sitting there as regally as anything. She didn’t speak to Yang much, but she listened to the radio chatter for about forty minutes, and sipped a cup of tea that someone brought her. Yang was jealous of that, too. He wondered when she would give up on waiting for her father to call her in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shouldn’t have doubted Elizabeth’s patience, however, because the call did come. Ansbach’s voice came over the radio. “Ansbach to the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” he said. “Who is on the bridge?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh here,” Yang said, answering the radio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Ansbach said. “Please tell me that Her Majesty is asleep right now.” Yang could tell exactly what that tone of voice meant from Ansbach. Even if Elizabeth was not asleep, he was supposed to lie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m right here, Commodore,” Elizabeth said, coming up behind Yang and taking the radio mic from his hand. “Is my father asking for me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a painful moment of hissing silence over the radio. Finally, Ansbach said, “Yes, he is, Your Majesty. He wants you in Geiersburg’s reception hall.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, excellent,” she said, sounding almost genuinely cheerful. “I’ll come straight away.” She pressed the mic back into Yang’s outstretched hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh here. Is there an escort ready or do I have to find one?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have guards meet you at the bay. You go with her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me? Why me?” The heavy silence from the other side was enough to make Yang sigh and say, “Fine. We’ll be there in about a half an hour. Can you tell me what she’s needed for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Ansbach said. “I have no idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Yang escorted Elizabeth out of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, met up with the contingent of heavily armed soldiers, and walked with her through the eerily silent corridors of Geiersburg fortress. She spent the whole walk looking around intently. Yang figured she was probably trying to assess the damage, and what fights had taken place in these halls, but he wasn’t sure how much she could learn from that observation. They didn’t meet a single soul on their way to the reception hall, until there were a gaggle of similarly armed soldiers outside, who let them all in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The reception hall was empty and large, with a small throne— or something that approached a throne— down at the far end, past a long red carpet. It was meant to mimic the halls of Neue Sanssouci, and it seemed truly ostentatious for a military fortress, but it was presumably a feature that the Braunschweig family had added during the fortress’s construction, so that when nobility came to visit, they had a suitably splendid place to hold parties. The duke was sitting on the throne, but when his daughter came in, he stood and held out his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Elizabeth, my darling,” he said. Yang never heard him so warm in greeting his daughter before, but he was in a strange mood, it seemed, riding the high of conquering the fortress. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elizabeth trotted away from Yang up to her father, her yellow dress fluttering as she went. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang got out of the way, and went to stand near the wall, waiting with the other soldiers. Curiously, there was no sign of Ansbach, Flegel, or Vering. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see you’ve conquered the fortress for me,” she said with a smile. Her attitude was totally different now, too, matching what she thought her father might want from her. “Is this your gift?” She let her father embrace her, though even with Braunschweig’s cheer, it was a somewhat unnatural looking hug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her father laughed. “Well, part of it. Come here.” He ushered her to sit down on the throne, then gestured for one of the soldiers who was standing by the wall to bring over a wooden box that he was carrying. Braunschweig opened the box and revealed a crown— not the huge ceremonial one that Kaiser Friedrich had worn in pictures, of course, but a crown nonetheless. It was gold, with sparkling red stones nestled in a floral filigree.  He held it up, and Elizabeth smiled at it as he placed it on her head. She touched it with two fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid it will be a little while yet before we can crown you in Neue Sansouci,” Braunschweig said. “But this will do for now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure,” she said. “It’s beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s very fitting for you. I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time. Are you ready for people to bow to you as kaiserin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled, but didn’t answer the question. Yang thought Braunschweig was asking in hypotheticals, but then he gave a signal to some of the soldiers at the far end of the room. “Bring them in,” he said loudly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doors swung open, and Ansbach stepped into the room first and gave a deep bow to Elizabeth sitting on the throne. “Your Majesty,” he said. “The prisoners.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And in through the door, at gunpoint, came soldiers who had been captured while taking the fortress. These were the imperial troops, those who didn’t belong to Braunschweig, who had resisted the invasion and lived. Some were wounded, though they all could walk. They shuffled into a few miserable looking rows, enlisted men and officers together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are the lucky few!” Braunschweig called out over the assembled as soon as the shuffling had stopped. “The first to greet your new kaiserin!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was dead silence from the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Her Majesty is very forgiving,” Braunschweig said. “Even though you fired upon her person, and failed to welcome her with the honors that she is due, she has no desire to waste your lives. She wishes that all of you remain her loyal subjects.” He glanced back at Elizabeth, who was sitting stiff and silent on the throne. If he took her expression under consideration at all, it didn’t seem to reflect in the contents of his speech.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you bow today, and swear your loyalty, and join my fleet, you will live,” he said. “If you fail to do so, you will be killed, to serve as an example for anyone else who thinks that they should refuse to bow to the rightful heir to the throne.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang couldn’t help but speak up. “Sir— you can’t kill prisoners of war! That’s—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig turned to face him, realizing he was there for the first time. “If I wanted your opinion, Leigh, I would have asked for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang glanced at Elizabeth, but she was staring ahead of herself at the assembled crowd with a completely inscrutable expression on her face. Her lips were slightly parted, and her breathing was heavy enough that Yang could see the rise and fall of her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach pointed to the nearest man in the front row of conquered soldiers. “You. Kneel and say you’ll serve Her Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soldier looked around nervously, first at the men next to him, then at the cold glare of Duke Braunschweig and the others. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soldier stumbled forward out of his line, and knelt before Elizabeth. “I serve— Kaiserin Elizabeth—” he said haltingly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Braunschweig said. “Get up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man did, and was shuffled away into a different room by some of Brauschweig’s guards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This process was repeated another ten or so times, enough for the first row of captives, all enlisted men, to be cleared. Elizabeth didn’t say a word during this process, and just looked on with that strange gaze. When the first officer, a captain, was pulled out of line, Yang suddenly knew that something was going to go wrong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang watched as the captain was pulled in front of Elizabeth. He refused to bow, so Braunschweig’s soldiers tried to force him to his knees. Braunschweig held them off, raising his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he doesn’t want to bow, then he can serve as an example for the rest,” Braunschweig said. He took out his sidearm, checked it over like it was a dueling pistol. “Are you sure you don’t want to pledge to serve the true kaiserin?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think I’m the traitor?” the captain asked. “You don’t have any claim—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Braunschweig said, and raised his gun. “If that’s the way you feel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Yang fixed his eyes on Elizabeth, who watched the scene with her lips slightly parted, and her hands clutching the armrests of her small throne, he could still see as Braunschweig pulled the trigger, and the man toppled to the ground at Elizabeth’s feet, staining the carpet with blood, and spraying the captive soldiers behind him with flecks of hot gore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get this out of here,” Braunschweig said, and two of his men hastened to comply, dragging the corpse away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You,” Ansbach said, and pointed at the next soldier in line. “Kneel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soldier did, falling quickly to knees before the throne, staining his hands and pants with blood.</span>

  <p>
  <em>
    <span>October 488 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>If one looked at the capital from above, it wasn’t immediately obvious that anything had changed over the few weeks since the Kaiser died. There had been no fighting in the street, no bombs dropped on the city, no tanks trundling down the roads to enforce a brutal new regime. Even coming closer, down at the level of the buildings, one might have been forgiven for thinking that there was nothing amiss. There had been no cancellation of the normal workings of society. People still went to school and to their jobs. The temple bells still tolled out every hour.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyday life went on. Almost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The capital was emptier than normal. When Kircheis walked past the formerly lively downtown district, especially the upscale areas where people with ‘vons’ in their names attended private clubs, he found the streets nearly deserted, and the music that had once drifted out in faint strains at night was silenced. Luxury goods stores were closed, and their windows were blocked up with plywood covered in cheerful looking posters, proclaiming that there was construction ongoing inside and that they would reopen soon. This was a lie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The further one walked from the richer areas of the city, the livelier it became, because the average middle class citizen of the capital had no ability to pack up their entire life and head for either the countryside or another planet entirely. They were forced to remain, no matter what was coming. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Store shelves were sparser than usual, though it was hard to tell if this was panic buying on the part of those who remained in the city, or the first ripples of the supply chain being shaken by civil war. Kircheis wasn’t worried about food right now, but he was on an errand from Hilde, clutching a prescription in his hand, and searching four different pharmacies for anyone who could fill it. He was dressed inconspicuously in civilian clothes, and if anyone wondered why a man his age was not in the fleet, the question would have been answered well enough by the prescription for seizure medication he brought up to the pharmacy counters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This last pharmacy he visited did seem to have the medicine in stock, and he waited by the counter, listening to the store music and counting the other customers who came in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pharmacist handed him the bottle of pills, and Kircheis asked, “Do you know if you’re going to have more of these, when I need to pick them up again next month?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pharmacist gave him a pitying expression. “No, I do not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis looked at the bottle. “These aren’t from Phezzan, are they?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If we can get the Phezzani version of them, we might have more later. These are local.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what’s the issue with supply?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” the pharmacist said. “Call when you run out. I’ll tell you if we’ve been able to switch suppliers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Outside, he examined the pills further, and looked up the manufacturer. O-Line Pharmaceuticals was the name, but the subtitle only became obvious when he visited the website: a Vering Industries subsidiary, with its manufacturing center right on Odin. That explained it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The businesses which Count Vering hadn’t been able to relocate off Odin before the Kaiser died had all been shut down— some of the Vering family scion’s own volition, the rest shuttered by… someone. It wasn’t entirely clear to Kircheis who was giving the orders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed a little unlikely that Lichtenlade, who had pronounced the young Erwin Josef to be Kaiser and was ruling as his regent, would have any interest in closing down pharmaceutical plants, since that would only lead to more instability in the capital, which Lichtenlade was desperately trying to avoid. But the force had come from somewhere, and the only other explanation was the part of the military on Odin that was operating as a shadow force for the Littenheim clan— the MPs, and their secretive, uncontrolled hierarchy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It would be simple enough to drag away all the owners and management of a factory, keep them in hidden jails or kill them outright, and lock the factory doors. The military police had plenty of experience doing so even during times when they were directly working for the Imperial government. They wouldn’t need to go as far as bombing the factories— this was just about sending a message and consolidating power.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis slipped the bottle of pills into his messenger bag, and then took the subway to the outskirts of the city, a long train ride. He watched the other passengers get on and off, and mentally compared the number to how many there used to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the last stop on the line, Kircheis got off and found the car in the parking lot that had been left for his use. It belonged to the Mariendorf family, but it was a beat up old pickup truck that was used for hauling landscaping equipment, so it was quite unremarkable, and Kircheis didn’t expect any trouble while driving it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He would have been making the three hour drive south into the countryside to see Hilde anyway, but it was convenient that he could do her a favor by searching the city pharmacies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The medicine wasn’t for Hilde, but for her cousin, Baron Kummel, with whom she was staying, along with the Baroness of Westpfale. (Magdalena had changed her name after getting married, but it was still easier in Kircheis’s mind to think of her as the baroness, rather than Countess von Leigh.) Since Baron Kummel had a second estate far out in the countryside, he had offered to let them both stay there and away from trouble. The trouble must have included Magdalena’s mother, since she had left her own country estate to join the baron, though he probably just enjoyed the company.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Kircheis drove, the city gave way to suburbs, then forest, then interspersed farmland. It was a bright day out. The leaves on the trees were past their peak of color, and were shaking loose to expose bare branches, coating the ground with brown mats of leaf litter. He didn’t mind the long drive. Out in the country, he could almost forget how strange and tense the city felt, and he was looking forward to seeing Hilde again. He had come up to visit before, but things had been so chaotic for the remains of Braunschweig’s staff on the planet in the days right after the Kaiser died that Kircheis hadn’t stayed long. He hoped to get a chance to speak with Hilde seriously— now that the first blows of the war had been exchanged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baron Kummel’s country estate was nearer to one of the forested areas than the farmed ones, and Kircheis had to drive up a long, ill-maintained path to get to it, the pickup truck bumping along over the ruts in the road. The building itself was beautiful, but it looked like it hadn’t been used in many years prior to the civil war. So, while the house wasn’t in ill-repair exactly, the landscaping had gone half-wild, and the roof could use new tiles. It just wasn’t at the level of polish that Kircheis had come to expect from noble houses. Still, it was pretty, nestled in among the autumn leaves, and Kircheis was grateful to the baron for allowing Hilde and Magdalena to stay there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He parked the pickup in the wide circular turn-around in front of the house, and didn’t bother ringing the doorbell, just walked inside. There were a few servants who would have answered the door, but Kircheis always felt odd about them, and he knew the door was likely unlocked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inside, the house was quiet. The lights weren’t on, so all the light in the massive foyer was coming in through the tall windows, filtered a warm red and yellow by the leaves outside. Kircheis headed for the library, where he knew Hilde often spent her days, but she wasn’t there. He happened to glance out the library window, though, and saw her outside, sitting on a lawn chair in the paved courtyard, next to the baron in his electric wheelchair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He made his way outside, and Hilde looked over when she heard the creaking of the door opening, and her face broke into a magnificent smile when she saw Kircheis. “Sieg,” she said. “Welcome back!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The baron rolled his head to look at him, too. “Hello, Herr Kircheis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis inclined his head in greeting. “Baron, Fraulein.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, take a seat,” the baron said. He lifted his arm to gesture at one of the other lawn chairs, but this revealed how frail and weak he was. Although he was not more than a few years older than Hilde, his hair was pure white, and his skin was so paper-thin that the blue of veins was visible even up into his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis sat, and Hilde handed him one of the blankets that she was wrapped in, since it was chilly out. Kircheis put his bag on the floor and accepted it gratefully, pulling the quilt around his shoulders. It was a nice day, but cold enough that he was surprised that someone in as ill health as the baron would want to be out in it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How was the ride up?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was fine,” Kircheis said. “Long, but there wasn’t any trouble on the road.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re staying the night, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’ll have me.” The answer was, of course, yes, so he smiled as he said it. “I was able to find your medicine, by the way, Baron.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you shouldn’t have gone to the trouble,” he said. “I hope it wasn’t too difficult.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No trouble at all.” He pulled the bottle of pills from his messenger bag and set them on the patio table. “Though I think that’s the last of it, unless there are Phezzani imports on the way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde looked at the bottle forlornly. “Will you be alright if you run out, Heinrich?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t answer the question, and just lay back on his chair to look up at the blue sky peeking through the leaves of the trees above. “If it is willed that I have more, then I will have more,” he said. “It isn’t important either way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis glanced at Hilde with some concern, and she gave a sad little smile back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if there is anything else I can get for you in the capital, Baron, please do let me know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Herr Kircheis.” There was a moment of silence. “How has the city been?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not too bad,” Kircheis said. “It feels like everyone is just waiting for the other shoe to drop.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have they evacuated the National Galleries yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re still open. I haven’t gone in to look at what’s on display.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope they put everything in vaults,” Kummel said. “I would like—” Whatever he was about to say was interrupted by a coughing fit that wracked his whole body. Hilde leaned towards him, but there was no comfort or help she could provide, so they all simply waited until it was over, and Kummel lay back, wheezing and catching his shallow breath. He didn’t seem like he wanted to continue his previous thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you heard any news?” Hilde asked, when there seemed to be no more immediate danger from the baron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Geiersburg fortress was captured,” Kircheis said. “That was where Commodore Leigh said he’d go first, so that’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know any of the details?” she asked. She kept her voice steady, though Kircheis knew she was worried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, other than that the Imperial forces lost it, and very few of the Imperial ships there were able to escape. If anything bad had happened to Braunschweig’s ship, I would have heard. So I’m sure the Braunschweig family is alright— and Commodore Leigh and your father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I expect that Kaiserin Elizabeth is going to stay in the fortress, since it’s the most easily defensible place, but Braunschweig and his fleet will head back to Odin as soon as they’re settled and have supply lines in place. I don’t know how long that’s going to take, but the faster the better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is my father still going to coordinate getting supplies?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Count Mariendorf was supposed to interface with minor nobility, and convince them to sell supplies from their home planets’ farms and factories directly to Braunschweig, to keep him supplied. Convincing people to do this would be a difficult task, as would logistically ensuring the supplies that were available actually made it to Braunschweig’s forces. Braunschweig had enough supplies to last him a few months, but he couldn’t count on his home territories to arm and feed his entire army in perpetuity, especially not if those lands came under attack, or if he had the routes between his homelands and his fleet blockaded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He is, unless plans have changed,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded. “Have you heard anything about Littenheim?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, not yet. It’s going to take a while for him to gather his troops, and when he does, he’ll come to Odin. He probably won’t have to engage with the Imperial fleet before then, and news about the Imperial fleet is all I’m able to get right now,” Kircheis said. Littenheim had moved all of his troops to his home territories long before all of this, but his lands were much more spread out and far from the capitol than Braunschweig’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will Braunschweig try to stop him before he gets here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That would be ideal, but there’s no way of knowing what route he’s going to take to get to the capital, so we can’t pick a battlefield to ambush him at.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right. I didn’t know if there would be any way to lure him out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably not,” Kircheis said. “Maybe by attacking his homelands, or the lands of his allies, but Commodore Leigh would never suggest that, and it would take away from getting to Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where is Countess von Leigh?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, please don’t call her that,” Hilde said with a laugh. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Maggie</span>
  </em>
  <span> is out paying social visits. She should be back for dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Her mother?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” the baron said. “Count Landsberg said he would come for dinner if she brought him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, that meant that there would be no serious conversation over dinner. Hilde, understanding this, gave him a smile. They would have to find some other time to discuss anything of importance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It seems like the whole nobility has made their way out to this part of the countryside,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not the whole of it,” the baron said. “But the reason my country house is here is that this has always been the best region for hunting and fishing and the like. My father used to love it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re related to the Mariendorfs how, again?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father was Hilde’s maternal uncle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis wanted to ask a somewhat indiscreet question, but he couched it as a statement to avoid feeling like an ass. “It seems like you became the baron very young. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry about my father?” he asked. “It was a long time ago, and I never really knew him. The Kummels have always been an unfortunate line. I hope the third cousin who is set to inherit from me is luckier than the past few generations have been.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He won’t inherit for fifty years,” Hilde said confidently. “He’ll have proved his luck by then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should be offended that you only think I’ll live to seventy-six,” Kummel said, but it was accompanied by a sad smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At least fifty years,” Hilde corrected.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The baron spoke again after a moment of silence. “I’ve always been very grateful to Count Mariendorf. He made sure that I was taken care of when my father died, so it’s a pleasure for me to be able to return a small portion of the favor these days. No one felt the need to court the alliance of a very sick man, so we won’t be bothered in this part of the woods, no matter what happens.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did Count Mariendorf take care of you, if I might ask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He petitioned the Kaiser to ensure that the barony would pass to me, for one thing. I am a genetically deficient man— I wouldn’t have been able to inherit without his intervention on my behalf.” The baron closed his eyes. “My father, when he was alive, sent me to a school for ill children. I stayed there even after he died, until I reached majority, but Count Mariendorf and Hilde often visited, which was more than most of the other children had. And I always had a place to go, for holidays.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His voice grew much quieter. “There were a few times when I grew so sick that the staff of the school were sure that I was going to die. In some ways— those were the happiest times of my life, because Count Mariendorf brought me to his home to be cared for. It was probably the medical attention I received there that saved me, but there is a part of me which attributes it to something else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis wasn’t really sure what to say to that, so he was silent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The baron opened his eyes. “Shall we go inside?” he asked. “It’s cold.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Magdalena did indeed haul Count Landsberg to the baron’s residence for dinner. The count was a man who gave Kircheis an unpleasant sensation of looking at a warped version of Martin. They were similar in almost every way— skinny frame, hairstyle, mannerisms, penchant for voicing quotations. Only, Count Landsberg was like if Martin had been born a rich man without troubles, and had never had a chance to develop any beliefs whatsoever. Baron Kummel and Magdalena seemed to like him, though, as he was a poet and author.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat down to dinner at the long dining table. The baron took the head seat, but he looked so small in his wheelchair that it was almost comical. The fact that the table was almost empty— having only the baron, Count Landsberg, Magdalena, Hilde, and Kircheis at it when it would easily seat fifteen— made the dwarfed sensation stronger. It could have lent a dire feeling to the dinner, but the conversation was cheerful, thanks mostly to Magdalena and the count.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m telling you, Heinrich,” the count said, “it’s not really the National Galleries that I’m worried about. Those, at least everyone can agree, don’t have any </span>
  <em>
    <span>strategic</span>
  </em>
  <span> value. And everyone who wants to inherit the throne also wants to inherit those. I’m of the opinion that they’ll come out just fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how you can say that,” Magdalena said. “I don’t think you know what’s going to happen as soon as soldiers arrive on the streets.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, I do,” the count said. “They’ll go for the mansions, and the palace. Honestly, that’s where the trouble is going to be. Just think about all the treasures that every noble family has been hoarding— that’s what’s in danger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re making quite the argument for nationalizing art,” Magdalena said. “My husband would agree with you if he was here, and we couldn’t have that.” She turned to Kummel. “Have you met Hank?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Once,” Kummel said. “He and I happened to be visiting Count Mariendorf on the same day, and we had lunch together. This was years ago, though. Do you remember that, Hilde?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes— I had forgotten that you met him.” She smiled. “He talked about his father’s interest in art history, didn’t he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think so, yes. Something about Ming Dynasty vases, if I recall. I liked him. He seemed like a nice man, though I’m surprised you married him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Magdalena said with a sly smile, “who else would I marry, except the most surprising choice?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Count Landsberg laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But that all reminds me,” Magdalena said. “I sent a letter to a friend of mine in the fleet on Odin—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie!” Hilde said, annoyed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mailed it with my mother’s return address, if you must know,” Magdalena said. “But I don’t think we need to be that paranoid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s your friend?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Mecklinger,” Magdalena said. “He works as a staff officer in the Ministry of War.” She waved her hand. “I don’t know what he does, exactly. Nothing of real consequence. We used to run in the same circles.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve met him,” Landsberg said. “He had a painting exhibit in— oh, whose gallery was it?” He snapped his fingers, then gave up trying to remember. “Tolerable landscape painter, but I didn’t think he was doing anything particularly unique.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I recall, Alfred, that same criticism has been levied at you?” Magdalena asked with a raise of her eyebrows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The count sniffed. “I’m not a painter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I quite liked his show,” Kummel said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I didn’t know you had gone to it,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I didn’t get out of the house to see it, unfortunately. But I subscribe to all the gallery mailers, and I like to see all the catalogs.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you liked it?” the count asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did,” Kummel said. “I’m not sure that lack of uniqueness is something he can be criticized for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No?” Landsberg asked. “On what merits should we be judging art, then, if not what it says?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Technical work has merit on its own,” Kummel said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Landsberg let out a huff of breath. “In the history of humanity there have been millions— hundreds of millions— who can paint just as well as Herr Mecklinger. Why should he have my attention?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you one of them?” Kummel asked. And then his voice took a turn for the melancholy. “I’m certainly not, no matter how much I may wish I was.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you, Maggie, what’s your opinion?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want me to critique the man I’ve said is my friend? I’m hardly unbiased.” But she cocked her head anyway. “Perhaps after all of this is over, he’ll have the chance to make more exciting art.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Landsberg said. “You think he’s going to be inspired by scenes of great devastation? By the destruction of the art of the past, when people set fire to the great houses?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Magdalena’s turn to laugh. “I’d say that’s more likely to happen to you, Alfred, since you have more connection to those great houses than he does. He grew up lower class, you know. But such a thing might be moving for you to see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re right,” Kummel said. His eyes took on a glazed look. “I never really thought I would witness something like all of this. I wish I could see it—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heinrich,” Hilde said. “You don’t mean that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t?” he asked. “Well, maybe I don’t. Is it silly to want to be part of history?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Most people would prefer to live peaceful lives,” Kirchies said. “I know that I would, if we lived in a kinder world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In a kinder world!” Kummel said. “In a kinder world, we would all have the choice to participate, not have it taken from us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of awkward silence, through which ran Kummel’s shallow breath. He grimaced and looked down at his plate, ashamed of his outburst.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What makes you say that Captain Mecklinger might be able to make more exciting art in the future, Maggie?” Hilde asked, trying to rescue the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena tossed her head. “Oh, I just meant that maybe under Elizabeth, artists won’t have to worry about being persecuted for ‘interesting’ ideas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think so?” Landsberg asked. “Really?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, my husband has Duke Braunschweig’s ear,” she said. “And he values such things, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Count Landsberg took a sip of his wine. “Won’t it make art altogether less interesting, if everyone can just say anything with no consequence? If there’s no rule to challenge, then it’s all…weightless. Art on Phezzan is dreadfully dull for that reason.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now you’re just being a contrarian,” Magdalena said. “You wouldn’t like challenging art even if you saw it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Landsberg laughed. “Maybe so. But I’ve yet to see it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was it you wrote to Captain Mecklinger about?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Maggie said. “I just meant to reassure you, Heinrich, that the captain is interested in protecting the National Galleries, and the galleries in the palace. He’s asked Littenheim to set aside troops for it, should it be necessary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And has Littenheim agreed?” Heinrich asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Magdalena said. “We’ll have to see, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The conversation turned to other topics, such as Count Landsberg’s latest short story. He pulled out his phone and read a selection from it, which Kircheis didn’t find particularly thrilling, but Kummel seemed to like it. He listened with rapt attention, and when he smiled, his face shone with the force of it. That made inviting Landsberg worth the trouble, Kircheis thought. The baron deserved the pleasure of company.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis stayed mostly silent for the rest of dinner, and Hilde chimed in only when encouraged by Magdalena. This made it easy enough for the two of them to slip away after dinner and go out for a walk. There was a small lake on the baron’s property, and that was where they went, with their breath rising in clouds through the air. Wrapped in jackets, they were warm enough despite the plummeting nighttime temperatures. They brought flashlights, and the beams bounced across the tree roots and glittering water as they walked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you been alright here?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” Hilde said, her voice curt. Kircheis knew she didn’t really mean the harsh tone in her voice, and she realized this herself and sighed. “Really.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you really wanted, you could come back to the capital.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And stay in your apartment?” She chuckled a little. “No, it’s fine, Sieg, really. I don’t think being in the city would make it much different. I’d still rather be in space.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So would I.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you mad at Commodore Leigh for making you stay here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He didn’t make me,” Kircheis said. “And no, I’m not. I can be useful here, and so can you, I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Useful,” she repeated. “I hope.” She was silent for a moment. “Have you spoken to Rear Admiral Reuenthal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Kircheis said. “And Captain Oberstein. I keep in touch with both of them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never spoken to Captain Oberstein,” Hilde said. “I only saw him at Hank’s wedding.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He and the commodore are good friends,” Kircheis said. “He’s trustworthy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde nodded. “And what do they have you doing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Kircheis hesitate momentarily. “Leigh didn’t tell me to follow their orders. It’s not really like that.” Indeed, it was one of the strangest arrangements that Kircheis had ever been in. He found himself coordinating between them, and if Reuenthal didn’t respect him as an equal, at the very least he wasn’t giving Kircheis orders. It was a little uncomfortable for both of them, Kircheis suspected. If Leigh were around, it would be different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Besides, there’s not much I can do. We don’t have resources on the planet. The captain and rear admiral give me what information they can, and we see if there’s anything we need to </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> about it, based on the contingencies that Leigh wrote up. We don’t want to do anything that Leigh isn’t expecting, because we can’t coordinate with him.” He paused and scuffed some of the leaves on the ground. Hilde was waiting for him to continue, so he did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral Reuenthal says he could send Commodore Leigh some surprise reinforcements, if we got word that he needed them, but there hasn’t been anything like that so far. It’s just watching and waiting.” The words spilled out of him. Describing it to Hilde made the frustration seem more real, or she was too easy of a place for him to let out the stress that underpinned every moment in the capital. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He continued. “A lot of Leigh’s plans on the planet presume that there’s going to be ground fighting, or trouble of some sort.” Kircheis shrugged. “But it’s been quiet, except for the MPs going after Braunschweig’s allies. It’s definitely for the best that Countess Leigh is out here— I think she’d be a target if she stayed in the city.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” Hilde understood his anxiety. They trudged along, kicking up leaf litter as they went. “Have you heard anything from Martin recently?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “Not since the Kaiser died.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know what he’s doing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I haven’t heard anything, so I have to assume he’s still doing fine. Maybe he’ll want to see me again, but I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to see him again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Kircheis said. He wanted a lot more than that, but Hilde understood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I hope—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” They walked in silence for a little while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When do you think everyone’s going to get back to Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A few weeks,” Kircheis said. “Don’t ask me what’s going to happen then. I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hank must have said something to you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He said a lot of things. And he says one thing and prepares for the other. He can </span>
  <em>
    <span>say </span>
  </em>
  <span>that he thinks he will defeat Littenheim one-on-one outside Odin, and that the Imperial government will fold to Braunschweig after that. But if he really believed that it would be that simple, he wouldn’t be having your father organize finding supplies when Braunschweig’s stockpiles run out. That will take six months to even start to pay off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, that’s Hank.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” It was Kircheis’s turn to look off into the distance. “I’m glad that he’s thinking ahead, but it makes it all feel that much more uncertain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is uncertain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis changed the topic. “How do you feel about all of Countess Leigh’s guests?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could just feel Hilde rolling her eyes, but it felt too rude to refer to Magdalena as anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re harmless,” Hilde said. “That’s the entire reason they’re all out in the countryside with us. And it makes Heinrich so happy to have guests, and I don’t mind the company either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t like them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just feel like making it known that the countess is hosting her salons might be dangerous, if word makes it back to the city.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think Maggie is that big of a target. But I’ll make sure to mention to Count Landsberg that he should be discreet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you really that worried?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Commodore Leigh would want me to be worried.” He smiled down at her. “I have a responsibility to you all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She frowned, visible even in the dark. “I don’t like it when you think of me as helpless, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think of you as helpless. But if someone came after the countess, Baron Kummel would be an obstacle for them to step through. And I like your cousin— I wouldn’t want him to get hurt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. You don’t have to tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were silent for a minute. “If things do get serious, I would want you with me,” he said. “If that means bringing Rear Admiral Reuenthal and Captain Oberstein here to talk, or you coming back to the city— I want you there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde leaned against his shoulder, and he wrapped his arm around her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you heard anything about Rear Admiral Mittermeyer’s wife?” Hilde asked. “Maggie keeps asking if she’s going to come up here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I went to see her the other day, since Commodore Leigh had left instructions for me to check in on her. She says that as long as her job is still open, she can’t pick her life up and leave to go on a vacation in the country, as much as she appreciates the offer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde laughed. “I’ll let Maggie know the disappointing news.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if she did want to leave the city, she might prefer to go be with her family. They live a few districts away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t tell that to Maggie. It would disappoint her too much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis laughed. “Alright. What she doesn’t know can’t hurt her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kircheis didn’t return to the city until the afternoon of the next day, and when he got back to his apartment, he had the sense that something was off before he even opened the door. He didn’t know what gave him that impression— perhaps it was just the fact that he had been on high alert ever since he had entered the city limits and dropped off his borrowed car in its designated space. After spending so much companionable time out in the countryside, and the silent and lonely drive back, the glances of the other passengers on the subway seemed suspicious and hostile, and none of Kircheis’s small polite smiles assuaged the feeling. Even the people who lived in the apartments next door, whom he had walked past hundreds of times, seemed to shuffle out of his way and skirt their gazes around him when he came up the street.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ominous feeling mounted until Kircheis went to open his door and found it already unlocked, swinging open beneath his hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wished, for the first time in his life, that he was carrying the sidearm that Commodore Leigh had given to him, but that was locked away in his safe inside the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If there was an intruder still inside, they most certainly had heard the clicking of the handle as Kircheis fumbled with his keys and tried the door, so he couldn’t very well try an alternate method of entry— going around to the side of the building and climbing up the fire escape. So, he went in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There, sitting at his kitchen table, was Rear Admiral Bronner. His hands were folded on a binder in front of him, and on the center of the table was the spare key to Kircheis’s apartment, the one that he kept taped inside his mailbox.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lieutenant,” Bronner said, smiling at him with his sickly smile, “it’s such a pleasure to see you again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This probably wasn’t immediately dangerous, though it certainly was dangerous in a more abstract way. Without making any expression, Kirchies silently closed the door behind himself. “What are you doing in my house, Rear Admiral?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should be more careful about where you leave your spare key,” Bronner said. “It’s not very secure to put it in a place associated with yourself. Hardly any better than putting it under the doormat, or above the lintel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you check there, first?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.” Bronner kept smiling. “Please, take a seat. I have something I need to speak with you about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long have you been waiting here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not long,” Bronner said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how did you know I’d be getting back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner’s smile was tight. “Do you really think I’d tell you? Sit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis sat. “I assume it wasn’t Commodore Leigh who sent you here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner laughed. “Of course not. Leigh wouldn’t trust me to do anything for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why are you here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just because Leigh doesn’t trust me doesn’t mean that I’m not still interested in him, and you by extension.” He slid the binder across the scratched kitchen table to Kircheis, who did not open it until Bronner pointedly stared at it. The binder wasn’t plain. The front clear cover had a folded poster tucked inside of it advertising a play— </span>
  <em>
    <span>Frühlings Erwachen.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>With some trepidation, Kircheis flipped open the cover. The first few pages of the binder were taken up by the text of the play shown on the cover, like Bronner was pretending to be a director, but as Kircheis flipped through, he found, to his horror— though not surprise— page after page of information about Martin nestled in among the innocent pages of the play There were marked locations on a map of the nearby areas, and photographs of Martin taken with a zoom lens, and bank records, and logs of people coming and going, and lists of names that Kircheis didn’t recognize.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your friend Martin is extremely lucky that most people who would ordinarily care to stop little would-be revolutionaries are all occupied with factional problems,” Bronner said as Kircheis leafed through the binder. As Kircheis stopped on one page, the one with the map, Bronner pulled the binder back away from him and snapped it shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what you want from me, if you already have all of this information,” Kircheis said. “It seems like if you want to arrest Martin, you could just do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What makes you think I bear your friend any ill-will whatsoever?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you were a republican, Commodore Leigh probably would have told me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner laughed— a thin, unpleasant, nasally sound. “Of course I’m not a republican.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want this country to continue to exist,” Bronner said. “I don’t particularly care how that gets accomplished, but I have no desire to see Neue Sanssouci bombed by little homegrown terrorists when no one’s paying attention to them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The country is not Neue Sanssouci,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nor is the country the Kaiser,” Bronner said with a thin smile. “But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The symbols are important, and if everyone starts to realize that the people in charge are </span>
  <em>
    <span>just </span>
  </em>
  <span>people playing the roles given to them on the stages set up for them, we’ll have more problems on our hands than two noble families at each others’ throats, especially if people happen to realize that right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What, am I giving Herr Bufholtz and his ilk more credit than you would even give them? That’s what they intend to do, isn’t it? Make it clear that all of the people, all across the land, don’t have to bow to some child whose father claims the throne is theirs?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think they’ll succeed?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a good story,” Bronner said. “It would make an excellent scene in a play, if the director was doing a good job. It might stir the audience.” He cocked his head. “Sometimes, a story is what you need.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop telling me riddles,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what are you saying? Are you going to arrest Martin or not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not really in my wheelhouse,” Bronner said with a smile. “I work in the basement of the Ministry of War. Your friend isn’t even remotely on my department’s radar. I only care about members of the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis stared at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner continued to smile. “But my department does care about the Military Police, in that they are part of the fleet, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>they </span>
  </em>
  <span>have some interest in keeping tabs on terrorists— or they did, before they decided to pivot to persecuting their own petty enemies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want?” Kircheis asked again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If the MPs aren’t going to do their jobs properly, that leaves it up to someone else. I have no real desire to see your friend be killed before he’s even done anything—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then leave him alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “—but I also have no desire to allow him to turn the capitol into a pillar of flame.” He steepled his hands over the binder. “This all can be taken care of in a way that would satisfy Commodore Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I doubt it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t say it would satisfy </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you think Commodore Leigh wants?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As little loss of life as possible,” Bronner said, and this time, his tone was severe, and he had lost his thin smile. “That is all he has ever cared about. Beyond republics, beyond kings, beyond games and rules, beyond himself and his friends— </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> is what Leigh wants, and he will do anything to achieve it. He would sacrifice his own life, and he would sacrifice your life, or my life, or Herr Bufholtz’s, if that was what it took to stop a real massacre, which is what your friend wants to provoke. Do you understand that, Lieutenant?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do not always agree with the commodore, but I have always understood him very well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think he’d want you to interfere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going to interfere,” Bronner said, and his voice was back to its usual slimy cadence. “But you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis could hear his own heartbeat. “What are you saying?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You, lieutenant, are going to use all of your skills, which I know you possess, and you are going to act. You are going to play the role of Herr Bufholtz’s friend. You are going to find out the day and the hour that he plans to make his move. And then you will tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No?” Bronner asked. “I don’t think you have a choice, lieutenant.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going to betray him. I don’t know what kind of man you think I am, but I’m not that one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner leaned back in his seat. “I’m not asking you to betray him. I’m asking you to help him. I can make it so that when the day comes, he can be spared.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not.” Perhaps Bronner really was as good of an actor as he claimed to be. There was something in his voice, serious and calm, having lost his usual brittle smile, that made Kircheis almost believe him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it didn’t matter if Kircheis believed him or not. Even if Martin were somehow capable of being saved, that would be the last thing that Martin would want. Though that didn’t stop Kircheis from wanting it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said again. He wondered if there was a little less conviction in his voice this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stared at each other silently across the table for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very well,” Bronner finally said. He picked up his binder and stood. “I’m sure you will go warn your friend that he’s under watch: fine. It won’t make any difference. You’ll come home, and until this is all over, you’ll spend every waking moment thinking if this is the day that someone with the authority has been convinced to waste their time, and go raid the headquarters of a student group. It will be a waste of their time— and to save it, they’ll just shoot everyone there. You probably won’t even hear about it until you go back there, and you don’t find the bodies, but you find the bloodstains. And you’ll wonder if Herr Bufholtz survived, and you’ll look for him, but in your heart, you’ll know he didn’t. And you’ll spend the rest of your life wondering if you could have done anything to stop it. I’m telling you now: you could. But you won’t, because you’re not that kind of man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long did you practice that speech, sir?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner snorted like a bull. “Ten minutes, in the bathroom mirror. Pity it didn’t change your mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner flipped open the binder and neatly extracted one page, the one with the maps. The binder’s rings clacked open and shut. He held the sheet out to Kircheis, who didn’t take it. He wiggled the paper at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m assuming you don’t already know where your friend is hiding, since I haven’t seen you go there. Here. Take it. Meeting him there will prove that your warning about him being watched is sincere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis took the map.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if you change your mind, you know how to contact me,” Bronner said. “I sincerely hope you do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner started to go for the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral—” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to make this offer to anyone else?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To little Lady Mariendorf, you mean?” Bronner asked. “Why, is she more likely to agree with me?” He smirked, and then was gone out the door. Belatedly, Kircheis realized that he had stolen his spare key.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The day that Kircheis went to visit Martin was cold and bright. The trees had lost all of their leaves, and the branches stood out in thin, whip-like lines across the cloudless blue sky. Martin’s hiding place was way off in the suburbs, in a town that was eerily like the one he and Kircheis had grown up in. The house was normal, too— a two story building with sage green siding, near the far end of a dead-end road, sitting on a well kept lawn. Kircheis wondered whose family member had died and left it vacant, since it didn’t seem like the kind of place that a rebel group would choose as a base. The house’s property was woody in the back, and it edged up against a forest that belonged to the town, one with a plethora of walking trails. In the aerial view that Bronner had provided, Kircheis could see one of these slim paths branching off from the main trail and heading towards the back of the house. He suspected that many of the members of the group were instructed to approach from that direction if they were coming, since the neighbors would likely find it odd to have a rotating cast of young people coming and going at odd hours of the day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis, however, approached on the main road. He had borrowed the Mariendorf family’s pickup again, but he left it some half a mile away and walked the rest of the way on foot. He didn’t want to scare Martin by leaving an unfamiliar vehicle parked on the street outside the house, though his presence would probably do enough harm on that front.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He let his hands dangle loosely at his sides as he strode up to the front door. He wanted to jam them into his coat pockets, since it was quite cold out, but he resisted the temptation. Kircheis wasn’t carrying a gun, and he didn’t want Martin to think that he might be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the apprehension of the unknown that made his heart pound strangely as he hopped lightly up the few front steps and rang the doorbell. He craned his neck to look at the sky as he waited, and waited.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was sure that someone was home. He was sure he was being ignored. He rang the doorbell again and got no response. Thinking of Bronner, Kircheis was tempted to kick back the mat on the step and look to see if there was a spare key, but instead he just sighed and sat down. The cold stone of the stairs leeched the heat from his body, and he shivered despite his warm jacket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was over half an hour before anything happened. Kircheis wasn’t sure how long he would have waited, but eventually a car pulled up into the driveway, one with two people sitting inside it. Martin was driving, and he got out, leaving the second person to sit as a vague shadow behind the tinted window. Kircheis didn’t stand up— he thought that would appear too threatening— and he put his hands on either side of his knees, gripping the cold stone of the stairs, in view so that they could see he wasn’t holding a gun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?” Martin asked. His tone was hostile and his whole body was tense. He squinted at Kircheis, though Martin’s back was to the white ball of the sun on its way down the sky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I needed to see you,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you not to look for me. How did you find me?” Kircheis wondered how much of Martin’s harshness was because he suddenly had to put on a show for the person in the car behind him, to prove his own loyalty— that he hadn’t given Kircheis his location.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can we talk about this inside?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Martin said. “You need to leave, right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I came to warn you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Warn me about what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bronner is the one who told me where you were. There’s going to be a raid on this place someday. I don’t know when, but it’s going to happen. You need to—” Kircheis’s voice froze in his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin just looked at him with a cold stare. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin, please,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want?” Martin asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to help you.” And the words cloyed in his mouth, not quite true as they were.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But this alone was what could soften Martin’s expression, if only for a second, his eyes finding Kircheis’s and holding there for just a moment too long. But then his expression hardened again. “Why did Bronner send you here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Kircheis admitted. “I’m probably playing into some trap of his, but I had to warn you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin glanced behind himself at the figure in the car, who made no movements.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You need to leave,” Martin said again. “Now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis didn’t know what he had expected to get out of this conversation. Perhaps if Martin had been alone, they could have spoken more candidly. But he had set out to warn Martin, and he had. So that would have to be enough, at least for now. Kircheis nodded and stood. “Martin—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please let me help you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their eyes met again, and Martin opened his mouth to say something, but changed his mind. “Don’t try to find me,” he said. “If I need you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know where I am,” Kircheis said. He began to walk down the driveway. He resisted the temptation to look into the tinted windows of the car, and just stared straight ahead. He could feel eyes on him. When he reached the bottom of the driveway, he turned his head and saw Martin looking at him. He stopped walking, and they looked at each other steadily. Kircheis raised his hand in a still and solemn wave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay safe!” he called.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin nodded, and Kircheis dropped his hand and walked away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Three days later, in his mailbox, he found an unmarked letter, one that was heavier than usual. He pulled it out with some trepidation, and discovered that it was just a single address. His heart would have soared to think that the letter had been sent by Martin, but to the back of it, he found taped the spare key to his house.</span>

  <em>
    <span>October 488 I.C., Geiersburg Fortress</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Admiral Merkatz and Count Mariendorf had, thankfully, not been present at Braunschweig’s execution of the prisoners, but both of them had heard of it from someone other than Yang, so the mood when they met the next morning was somber. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t want to talk about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They met over breakfast, on Merkatz’s temporary flagship docked in Geiersburg, in his personal dining room. There wasn’t much personal about the place. The dining table and chairs they sat at were expensive real wood, but there was no other decor, just bare walls. The three silently ate for some time, the clinking of dishware the substitute for conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you spoken to the duke?” Merkatz finally asked. It wasn’t clear which of them, Count Mariendorf or Yang, he was addressing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not today,” Yang said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m meeting with him at ten,” the count said. “After that, I expect I’ll be leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Already?” Merkatz asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s no reason for me to stay,” Franz replied. “I have a job to do, and travel isn’t fast.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s no reason to stay around here, anyway,” Yang said. “Though I’m sorry you’re going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a military man,” Franz said. “I wouldn’t be useful to you, even if I was here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Merkatz said, “you might be. The duke is far more likely to take the advice of a peer than he is to take anyone else’s.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m hardly his peer. My estate is small, compared to his. Leigh is equivalent to me, in that respect,” Franz said. It was intended as a joke to lighten the mood, but neither Yang nor Merkatz laughed. “Are you certain he won’t listen to you?” he asked Merkatz.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On military matters, he will defer in part. The duke is aware of his own shortcomings when he wants to be— he wouldn’t have recruited capable advisors if he wasn’t. But this is not going to remain a military matter for long, if everything goes well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you headed directly for the capital?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang and Merkatz glanced at each other. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Merkatz said. “It’s where Littenheim is certainly going to be going, and there’s no reason to give him an advantage of entrenching himself in that system if we can avoid it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you agree?” Franz asked Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang ran his hand through his hair. “There are other things that we could do, but if we can defeat Littenheim quickly, then it will be better for everyone. Doing anything other than confronting him would be delays that wouldn’t win us more than they would cost.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can ask if you think we will be able to beat him,” Yang said. “I’m not offended by the question.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not one my daughter would ask,” Franz said with a bit of a chuckle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She should,” Yang said. “I’d always give her an honest answer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And do you think you’ll win?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Littenheim has far more ground troops than we have— Braunschweig’s ground forces are committed to his estates” —and Cahokia, but Yang didn’t mention that— “so we’ll be at a disadvantage if it becomes a land battle. In space, I think we’re better off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will it become a land battle?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged. “Littenheim knows his weaknesses and strengths better than I do, so if he decides he can’t win in space, he’ll force it to become one. But there’s plenty of good reasons to stay off of Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does Littenheim care about those reasons?” Franz asked. “I know one of them is concern for the people of the planet, but I recall you telling me that the commander he recruited— High Admiral Ovlesser— I think you described him as ‘not gently weighing the scales of human life.’”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll care that he’s opening a second front battle,” Yang said. “If either Littenheim or Braunschweig wins decisively in space, Lichtenlade could probably be convinced to surrender to the victor. But if that doesn’t happen, he’s not going to let Littenheim walk into the capital and do as he pleases.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you agree with this assessment?” Franz asked Merkatz.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Merkatz said in his gruff voice. “It’s vital that we win quickly and decisively before any troops land on Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I almost feel like I should wait to leave, to see the outcome,” Franz said. “If it is decisive, there won’t be a point in making the rounds for supplies.” The silence from Yang and Merkatz told him enough. He wiped his hands on his napkin. “That would be too easy, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Decisive will need to mean complete annihilation,” Merkatz said. “This is a battle for his own future— and he either wins or dies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t say I know much about him personally,” Mariendorf said. “I don’t think I’ve ever spoken more than five words to him. Is that really going to be his stance?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked into his empty teacup. “He’s correct in thinking about it that way. I don’t think the duke would accept his surrender.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, he wouldn’t,” Merkatz said. “If the two of them didn’t hate each other quite so much, maybe it would be less personal for both of them. As it stands, I don’t think there’s anything that could cause them to set aside their differences, and that’s only going to become more true after they meet in battle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Franz said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang leaned back in his seat and looked up to the sky. “You couldn’t have avoided hearing the way Littenheim has tried to set up this fight as a battle for the soul of the country.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I try not to pay attention to gossip.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you and I are in agreement on that,” Merkatz said. “He can’t even make his accusations outright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I see,” Franz said, catching Merkatz’s meaning immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Regardless if the accusations are true,” Yang said, “if Littenheim says that Braunschweig is a petty tyrant who kills anyone who stands in his way, it means that Littenheim’s believes Braunschweig can’t be stopped, compromised, or reasoned with, other than through complete destruction.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m surprised he’s not describing it as wiping out a stain on the Goldenbaum line,” Franz said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think that would come too close to challenging the line itself,” Yang said. “But maybe he’ll get there, if this stretches on long enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think it will?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope not,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz spoke up. “Littenheim will do anything to prolong the fight. Where there’s life, there’s hope, as they say. I don’t know what he’ll do if he ends up desperate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The duke would do the same, wouldn’t he?” Franz asked. “Fight to the last man?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Yang said. “But I think we have a better position than Littenheim overall, so that won’t be our problem.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even without ground troops?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Yang said, and his voice was assured enough that Franz nodded. “We’re in a better position. It’s just a position that will cost time and lives to win from.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s no position that wouldn’t,” Merkatz said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Count Mariendorf put down his coffee. “Is there anything you’d like me to say to the duke before I go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang glanced at Merkatz again, but Merkatz just said, “I’m a soldier. I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to involve myself in the duke’s politics.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think he’d listen to anything you could say,” Yang said. “He didn’t listen to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lucky he values you. He doesn’t usually tolerate anybody trying to get in his way,” Merkatz said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should have tried harder.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. And don’t try at all, next time. Save your efforts for where they can do some good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned. “Even if I agreed with you, I doubt I’d be able to stop myself, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be there, next time. Leave it to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll speak with the duke,” Franz said. “I’ll see if I can make it so that there isn’t a repeat of last night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I might remind him that my daughter is about the same age as Elizabeth, and I think for her own happiness, it would be better if she didn’t have to witness her father behaving like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think that will work?” Yang asked. “He did it deliberately.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like you, I have to say </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” He wiped his hands again and stood. “This will be a difficult alliance to hold together if everyone has to fear Duke Braunschweig’s unreasonable whims. And it will start to look like Littenheim is correct in his insinuations. I’ll remind him of that, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fearing the leader’s whims has been the nature of this dynasty for almost five hundred years,” Yang said as he stood up, which made Merkatz shake his head. He put down his own cup and stood as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Commodore, we should meet again later to talk about what forces we’re leaving at Geiersburg, and what our deployment is going to look like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Yang said. He glanced at his watch. “At twelve?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Merkatz said. “Count Mariendorf, if I don’t see you again before you leave, good luck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Franz said. He shook Merkatz’s hand. “Good luck to you, as well. I suspect you’ll need it more than I will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps,” Merkatz replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang and Count Mariendorf headed out of Merkatz’s flagship together. The count was quiet for a minute, until they were almost off the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re right that this has been the status quo for five hundred years,” he said. “But I was under the impression that you aimed to somehow improve that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did Hilde tell you that? Or is it just that you think I’m a little too much of a republican?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need my daughter to tell me everything.” He smiled at Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I like to think that I’m doing something that will eventually make the universe a better place,” Yang said. “Duke Braunschweig makes that more difficult than I’d like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He does.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t think you’ll have trouble convincing people to join him, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That depends. If you win decisively enough the first time you meet Littenheim, that will go far in convincing people that they should back the ultimate victor.” They crossed the ramp out of Merkatz’s ship into Geiersburg’s bays. Soldiers streamed all around them. “Duke Braunschweig is very lucky that his counterpart is equally charismatic— this would be much more difficult if Littenheim was more beloved than he is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s by design,” Yang pointed out. “Neither of them are great speakers or military men on their own. Back when Prince Ludwig was alive, Friedrich wouldn’t have let someone who could conceivably gather support against him marry one of his daughters.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, only someone who could murder him,” Franz said, rather grimly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think Duke Braunschweig killed Prince Ludwig?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His recent behavior has not demonstrated that it would be unthinkable,” Franz said. He looked over at Yang. “But you must not think he did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you say that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I find it hard to believe that you’d want to support him for the throne, if he was that eager to commit regicide for it. Whoever killed him made civil war unavoidable— and I know you. You wouldn’t have wanted that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned, and scuffed the textured metal of the floor with his toe as they lingered near the exit to the bay. No one was in hearing range now, all the soldiers busy at work and rushing towards and away from the great ships. There was a part of Yang that wondered— if he had told the Kaiser the truth, if war could have been averted, if an heir could have been named immediately. Perhaps millions of lives would have been saved. But Yang hadn’t done that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I wouldn’t have wanted to start a civil war,” Yang said. “You’re right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang cocked his head and looked over the count’s shoulder. “Prince Ludwig’s life wasn’t worth more than that captain yesterday,” Yang said. “Braunschweig </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> eager to kill for the throne— I don’t know if it matters who.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The count put his hand on Yang’s arm. “Hank—” And then he cut himself off. Even if no one was listening, it was far too dangerous to discuss Yang’s loyalties out in the open, and that dangling question was what the count wanted to ask about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I still think that there can be a better future,” Yang said. “This is where I need to be, to make that happen. I think it’s still worth it, even though…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve changed. Ten years ago, you wouldn’t have said that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you think so?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Admiral Merkatz told me about what happened at El Facil.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Yang ran his hand through his hair. “I apologize for lying to you back then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I— I understand why you did. You’re not the only one who’s changed over these years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir.” He smiled. “You’ll have to tell Hilde that you know. She’ll be relieved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She knows?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told her the first time I saw her after getting back to Odin. I’m afraid I’ve been trying to make your daughter a rebel this whole time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “There may be worse things to be in this world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think it’s true that I’ve changed, though, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang splayed his hands. “I’ve had a lot of practice making compromises, in the hope that something good would come of it down the line. El Facil was just the first time that turned out to be true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Franz studied him for a second. “The first time?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang wasn’t sure what to say to that. “Well, I don’t know, sir.” He looked away. “The first time I felt like I was doing good for the world, and not just myself, and making excuses for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Franz squeezed Yang’s arm. “Hank— if you’ll let me say something—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, sir. Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suspect you won’t listen to me, but not only has your presence been invaluable in my life, and in many others, I’m sure— but your life and happiness is worth something for its own sake. I hope you remember that, no matter what else happens.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was uncomfortable to listen to Franz say this, and when Yang tried to take a breath to respond, he realized his throat was thick with emotion. “Please don’t sound like you’re saying goodbye, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to be,” Franz said. “But be careful. Don’t—” And he cut himself off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll try,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Although there was a great rush of activity on Geiersburg before the fleet headed out, the living area where the Braunschweig family was staying was quiet. Yang, though he had no right or official reason, headed there, on an errand of saying one last goodbye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he rang the bell on the Braunschweig family quarters, he was surprised to see Princess Amarie open the door. Perhaps he shouldn’t have been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Commodore Leigh,” she said, “what brings you here?” For once, her hair was down around her shoulders, and she was wrapped in a delicate shawl. It made her look more fragile than usual.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping to get the chance to overstep my bounds once more, before I left.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is the Kaiserin around?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Amarie said. “She’s with her fiancee, in the gardens. Supervised, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was it you wanted to say to her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodbye, mostly,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come in, Commodore. You don’t need to stand in the hallway.” She held the door open, and Yang stepped inside the lavish quarters, his footsteps suddenly quieted by an elaborate rug. “Can I offer you a drink?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, thank you,” Yang said. “I should be getting back soon. We’re not that long from heading out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Amarie nodded, but poured herself a drink from the decanter sitting on the coffee table. She sat down on the green velvet couch, and gestured for Yang to take a seat across from her, with his back to the huge, glass-fronted bookshelves and cabinets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why was it that you wanted to say goodbye? It is overstepping your bounds, as you said.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Princess, against my better judgment, I care about your daughter as a person, rather than just as a head to wear a crown,” Yang said. “I was hoping to make sure she’s doing well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was silent for a second, then she said, “My husband told me about the last meeting you had with my father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about it?” He watched her tip her glass back and forth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you really my father’s friend, in the end, Commodore?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “And I’m sure it’s just as impossible to be your daughter’s friend. But I did care about your father, in the way that I could, and I care about her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see. And you hoped to reassure Elizabeth, and tell her that her father will return victorious?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “I don’t like making overconfident predictions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what would you say to her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d tell her the plan, if she wanted to know it. I know you don’t approve, Princess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Amarie tapped her fingers on her glass. “It’s not that I don’t approve. This isn’t my world, Commodore, and it’s not hers. I wouldn’t be assured by you telling me about how you plan to conquer Iserlohn Fortress, and I doubt she would be, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t know you knew about that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It may not be my world, but I’m not stupid, or blind. From the day my husband tried to petition my father for an outpost in the corridor— there’s only one thing that could possibly be for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you have some sympathy for us,” Amarie said, “though I’m not sure I appreciate the sense of pity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if anyone could pity you.” It was funny— she reminded Yang very strongly of Reuenthal in that moment, though the two of them were as different as people could possibly be. They had some of the same cold grace, though, and the same hatred of being seen as weak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, they could.” Although she hadn’t actually drank anything from her cup, she put it down on the table before her. “You don’t like giving overconfident predictions, but you understand what will happen if my husband loses this war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I give you some advice, Princess?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How could I stop you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If things look like they’re going badly, get to Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed. “Oh, the worst thing anyone could do is prolong the inevitable. I despise false hope.” She looked in his eyes, and Yang wanted to squirm away. “If Littenheim has any sense, he’ll send a few ships to wait just out of range of this fortress— if any little convoy starts fleeing to Phezzan, it will be hunted down. As soon as my husband’s fleet leaves, we’ll be trapped here, with whatever few ships he sees fit to give us. And don’t tell me that this fortress is defensible— we’re sitting in it right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In a situation where there is a fleet that can launch from Geiersburg, it is much easier to defend,” Yang said. “We were able to capture it by preying on the weaknesses of the situation, not the fortress itself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We?” she asked, very pointedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then let me put it bluntly: I don’t know if a different commander would be able to take this place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And when Littenheim has won, and he brings the whole brunt of his forces against me here? Even if I could be a prisoner forever, I have no doubt that everyone else here would rather surrender than be entombed with me.” She pointed behind Yang, to the bookshelves and drawers that he was sitting in front of. “Third drawer, if you please, Commodore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang twisted on the couch and leaned far over the back to pull open the heavy wooden drawer of the cabinet. Inside was a small jewelry box, which he pulled out to sit on his lap. When Amarie said nothing, he lifted the lid, finding small, unmarked bottles of pills.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome to take some with you, if you like. I have more than enough,” she said. “I’m told the pinks are only a sedative, but you take it at the same time as the blues so that you’re peacefully asleep when the poison takes effect.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And did you offer these to anyone else?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who else would I offer them to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Vering, maybe. Or your husband. Or Ansbach, since you’re offering them to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ansbach was the one who got them for me,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You trust him quite a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s been a loyal man for many years. I notice these things— that’s a skill of my world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that why we’re talking now?” Yang closed the jewelry box and put it back in the drawer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You prefer your sidearm?” she asked, watching him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang splayed his hands. “I don’t carry a sidearm. I gave mine to my lieutenant, and he’s back on Odin. I prefer not to die.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head. “You are a strange man, Commodore. I should have given you the same gift for your loyalty that I gave Ansbach a few years ago. Pity I only had one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need any gifts,” Yang said. “I’m a very simple man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t like my father’s gift to you, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was too generous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t think that’s it,” she said. “You don’t like gifts, because they might mean something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what would it mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That you might actually be the loyal man you pretend to be, Commodore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned.  “I should go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good luck to you,” she said. “I hope we see each other again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>November 488 I.C., En route to Valhalla Starzone</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>There were a few routes to Odin from Geiersburg Fortress, all of which were about equal length, but they narrowed down to one trunk as they came towards Valhalla starzone. Odin’s location as the capital planet had been chosen for this reason: this singular entry point made it very defensible, even from enemies within the Empire itself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s fleet’s journey to Odin was safe until they reached this last branching point. Until that point, there was no one chasing them or blocking their path, simply because it would have been too difficult to predict which of the many routes Braunschweig would take. But when they reached the main line on the map, although they kept plowing ahead, their navigators kept their eyes fixed to their instruments, eyes peeled for any kind of deviation in the track that they were following.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The tension rose higher and higher as they approached Odin. Even Braunschweig, a man known for his confidence, took to pacing back and forth on his command dais. Travel was always long and difficult to bear, and things had been tense on their way to Geiersburg, but not knowing where the enemy was going to approach from made it worse by a thousandfold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was lucky to be awake and on the bridge when the first signs of trouble appeared. In a normal battle, this might have been a communications blackout, but here, the alarm was raised by the chief navigator.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sirs, I’m getting a signal of obstructions along the path,” he said. “I don’t know what it is— could be asteroids, or a gas cloud—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But everyone’s mind immediately went to the only place it could: Littenheim had arrived at Odin first, and had blocked the path. It was either ships or mines, but as they approached closer, they could see that the mass wasn’t quite enough for ships. Littenheim had been here, and had filled the path behind him with mines. If their ships tried to fly through them faster than light, they would be torn to shreds, as they would be if they tried to pass their ships through the solid bulk of a planet. But even if they slowed to sublight speeds, they would be vulnerable to the mines, and would have to clear the field before they could head towards the planet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig convened his advisors to discuss what they were going to do about it, though it was clear that he had already made up his mind from the moment they all sat down in his wardroom. Braunschweig sat imposingly at the head of the table with his nephew, Baron Flegel, on one side, and Ansbach at the other. Also in attendance were Yang, Merkatz, and the unfortunate Hans von Vering, who sat next to Flegel uncomfortably.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t have much of a choice,” Braunschweig said. “We need to clear the mines to get to Odin. And as quickly as possible. The question is only of how. Can we get away with a long narrow passage, or do we have to clear the majority? Gentlemen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I say something, sir?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s nose wrinkled. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think we should spend our time clearing the mines,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first, the room was quiet, and then Flegel laughed. “And how do you think we get to Odin, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, sir, look at it this way— do we know where Littenheim is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On the other side of those mines, Leigh,” Braunschweig said. “He wants to wear us down, and have time to entrench himself. That is generally what mines are used for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But what would he get out of that?” Yang asked. “Sir— right now, this is the only path to Odin, right? He’s essentially cut off his own supply lines— and the entire population of Odin with him— if he’s hiding behind there. It’s like he’s invited us to starve him out. It doesn’t make sense as a strategic choice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz spoke up. “Do you think that Littenheim believes we will starve him out? I believe he’s expecting us to clear the mines, and this is just buying him time. He couldn’t have arrived here too long before us. An extra few days would be to his advantage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He does expect us to clear them, sir,” Yang said. “But I don’t think he’s waiting for us on the other side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why not?” Merkatz asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This seems designed to waste our time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think we’re all in agreement there,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang pulled a pad of paper from the center of the wardroom table towards himself and started drawing a diagram on it. “Look,” he said, “the most important thing to understand is that Littenheim’s goal right now is not Odin itself. He doesn’t care about defending the capital from us— he wants to crush us. If we’re too fixated on getting to Odin, we lose sight of the bigger picture.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang sketched a line on the paper: their forces, the mines, Odin. Then he continued. “Look at this: we’re trapped in a narrow little corridor— just like Iserlohn— with, right now, a wall on one side of us. If we start wasting our time clearing the mines, and Littenheim comes up behind us, we will be completely encircled, and won’t be able to retreat either out into space or down towards Odin.” He shook his head. “Littenheim doesn’t need to care about his position in space around Odin— he already has us walking into the perfect trap.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a very interesting story, Commodore,” Flegel said, in his most dismissive tone. “But there’s no evidence for it to be true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baron Flegel is correct,” Braunschweig said. “And, contrary to Commodore Leigh’s assertion, Odin </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> valuable. If Littenheim controls the capital, he controls the perception of this war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang glanced over at Merkatz, hoping for support, but Merkatz said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re friends with Count Mariendorf, aren’t you, Commodore?” Vering asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then you should know how important it is to have something to use to gather support among the lesser nobles, the industrialists like my father— they’re the people who will keep us able to fight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was losing this argument. “Mines and ships aren’t symbolic,” Yang said. “Littenheim needs to defeat us if he wants control. If he’s smart—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig laughed. “He’s not. That’s your problem, Leigh. You’re a little too clever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned and slumped back in his seat. He lifted his eyes just once. Ansbach didn’t look back at him, but was studying Yang’s scribbled diagram.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>After the meeting, which devolved into a long discussion about the best way to clear up the mines, Yang caught Merkatz on his way back to his shuttle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir!” Yang called. Merkatz stopped and waited for him in the hallway, though he waved for his own aide— some young man named Schneider— to go ahead to the shuttle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was out of breath when he caught up to Merkatz.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to try to ask me to change my mind about where Littenheim’s fleet is, Commodore?” Merkatz asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said when he had caught his breath. “But— why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz looked at him sidelong. “For once, I find myself in agreement with the duke’s strategic thinking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Yang said, though he couldn’t keep the disappointment out of his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz never showed much emotion, but he took pity on Yang. “Commodore, if it was you and me in the corridor, and we encountered the rebels doing this, I would believe that there is some kind of trick involved. But the duke knows his opponent far better than I do— and I have to agree that he has never shown much creativity, in the years I’ve heard his name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang frowned. “Even if Littenheim isn’t creative— he’s been recruiting talent.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz raised an eyebrow. “And is he any more likely to listen to that talent than the duke is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know Admiral Ovlesser,” Merkatz said. “He’s a very direct man. If he’s coordinating, there won’t be any tricks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Lieutenant Commander Vering is right, as well. We need a victory at Odin— in Valhalla.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll be with the duke, at least, and in the rear, since he has no interest in clearing mines himself. Does that ease your mind any?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Some,” Yang said. “Just as long as we can react quickly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll admit it eases my mind,” Merkatz said. “But I hope nothing comes of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enjoy your cleanup duty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will, thank you, Commodore,” Merkatz said with his wry voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The procedure to clear out a minefield, especially one as widely spread as the one blocking their path, was a slow one. It involved ships proceeding as carefully as they could through the dangerous area, sending out jets of directional zephyr particles, which they would then ignite with the ship’s guns once the gas was far enough in front of them, creating a ball of flame that would swallow up the nearby mines. Before the invention of directional zephyr particles, the process had been much slower: bomb attracting decoys had needed to be sent to clear a path through. That was costly in terms of resources as well as time, and a fleet the size of Braunschweig’s might not have even carried enough decoys to clear a path. At least zephyr particles could be manufactured on the engineering ships, even if the process was time consuming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t want to leave the bridge, feeling tied to it by the impossible-to-dismiss fear of an ambush, but even he had to sleep sometimes. And Braunschweig, who also spent much of his time in his position of authority, could only tolerate so much of Yang (and Hans von Vering, for that matter), so Yang couldn’t lurk there as much as he might have preferred.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He and Vering ended up in the same place quite often for this reason. Yang got the sense that Ansbach thought that Yang should babysit him (or should be tortured by having to deal with him), so when Yang wandered off the bridge to go take his dinner, or sit in the officers’ lounge, Ansbach would quickly dismiss Vering to go do the same. And when Vering left, Ansbach would give Yang a signal to go follow him and make sure he was not in trouble. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering wasn’t even a troublemaker, so it all seemed quite pointless. In the times Yang watched him, he mainly sat around and drank, and would try to get the other officers to gamble with him. They rarely took him up on the offer, but he never seemed to grow tired of asking. He was a sore winner and a grumbling loser, though he had so much money to throw around that he should hardly have missed it when he did lose. Yang supposed it must be the principle of the thing for him, but it made him quickly run out of willing opponents on board the ship, even when he offered to bet over things other than cards: the outcome of a chess match, or darts. It was almost painful to watch him continue to try to recruit friends in this way, since it never worked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was strange— Yang had always liked people that he felt he could give a helping hand to, and Vering certainly was in this category, but Yang struggled to find much affection or even sympathy for him. It was unfair to the young man, of course. There was plenty about his situation that was deserving of sympathy: he was out of his depth, and, like Elizabeth, was being used as a tool of the older generation. And Yang </span>
  <em>
    <span>often</span>
  </em>
  <span> found himself friends with people whom nobody liked— he could see immediately through Oberstein’s cold and awkward demeanor to a person whom Yang could respect and enjoy the company of— but there seemed to be very little to Vering to like. And he made no effort to like Yang, either. For this reason, Yang, and Yang alone, was spared being asked to play cards. He might even have taken Vering up on the offer out of pity, if he had asked. But he never did, no matter how much time they spent in the same place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was why, when the alarm finally came, as Yang had known it would, he and Vering were alone in the officers’ lounge, sitting as far away from each other as they could get. Yang had arrived first, and had positioned himself near the faux fireplace to read a book in the plush armchair there, which meant that Vering was at the other side of the room, drinking a beer and playing a game of solitaire on one of the tables, pointedly not looking at Yang. When the wail of the alarm pierced the air, he jumped, knocking his beer with his elbow, and it fell to the floor and shattered, foam and glass going everywhere.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stood in a hurry, then clearly didn’t know what to do with himself once he had stood, looking back and forth between the mess on the floor and the door, where the visible alarm flashed red. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s going on?” Vering asked. He might not have been asking Yang specifically, but since Yang was the only person in the room, it was up to him to answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume we’re getting ambushed,” Yang said. He tucked his bookmark into his book, then tossed it on the side table. “Come on. Are you coming to the bridge?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Outside the lounge, they could hear pounding feet in the corridor as soldiers ran past, all headed for their duty stations. Yang’s nonchalance was unfeigned when he walked to the door and held it open for Vering. There was something about the breaking of tension that made him slip into a cool decision-making mode. He would feel the horror of it all later, but for now, he could keep his wits about him. It all broke down into simple, clear steps that he could take: get to the bridge, assess the situation, come up with a plan. Walking through a sequence of events, one following another, no matter where they led, gave Yang a strange clarity and calmness that other people seemed to lack.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang escorted Vering to the bridge. Ansbach was already there, as was Braunschweig, of course. Yang was relieved that Baron Flegel had, with his section of the fleet, been assigned mine-sweeping duty, and was not on the flagship. The bridge was frantically busy, and Yang pulled Vering over to Ansbach to get an update on the situation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How much time do we have before they get here?” was Yang’s first question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They didn’t drop sublight until they were on top of us,” Ansbach said. “Thirty minutes to contact, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that good?” Vering asked, naked fear in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s better than if we were already being shot at,” Yang said. “Has Merkatz started moving the fleet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach pointed towards the front of the bridge, where the display showed the positions of each individual section of Merkatz’s fleet buried among the mines. They had scooped out a cavity in the center of the minefield, but this had been done by spreading the fleet, and now that cleared area looked less like a victory, and more like a death trap. If the fleet did not carefully maneuver back into position, they would obliterate their own flanks by running them into the mines, without Littenheim’s fleet firing a shot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What they needed was time, time to get Merkatz’s fleet out of the minefield, time to organize into a defensive line— but that was what they did not have. They had a small section of the fleet outside the minefield, Braunschweig’s “rear guard”, and with it, they would need to fend off Littenheim for as long as they could. With them were about half of the engineering ships, the ones generating zephyr particles, which rotated in and out of the minefield in shifts as their tanks refilled. It was this little detail that Yang’s mind seized on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does the duke already have a plan he wants to enact?” Yang asked. There was no point in bringing up his idea if the duke was already settled on something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Ansbach said. “What are you thinking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can we retreat right to the mouth of the minefield, and use our FTL, just for a moment, so we move faster than they’re coming at us?” Yang asked. “It buys us a little more time, and gets us closer to our allies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach looked skeptical. “It’s dangerous to do that so close to the mines.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Our formation out here is small enough that I’m not worried about overshooting the mark, and we’re in one of the transit lanes— not in the gravity well of a star. That makes it a lot easier.” Yang said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach nodded slowly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And, while we do that, send all of the zephyr gas we have out in front. It won’t go too far, but if we’re backing up, Littenheim will end up closer to it than we will. It might break up their front line, or at least give us a little more time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach thought about it for half a second, then nodded sharply and turned away to go relay the plan to Braunschweig. Yang was fine with this— it was easier if he did it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is crazy,” Vering muttered under his breath. “This is—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please get a hold of yourself,” Yang said. “Here. Come talk to Merkatz with me. I’m sure he already knows what needs to happen, but let’s make sure we’re on the same page.” He pulled on Vering, who had gone all pale and sweaty already, though a single shot hadn’t even been fired. Yang led him like a puppy over to the communications console, where he asked the radioman to get in contact with Merkatz.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang saluted as Merkatz’s fuzzy image appeared on screen. “Sir,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz squinted into the camera, and saw Vering looming behind Yang. “I assume you have a contingency plan, Commodore?” Merkatz asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now wasn’t the time for apologies— and Yang just nodded, getting to the point. He briefly explained what the rear guard was going to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll need to arrange the fleet behind us while we hold the line,” Yang said. “Will you have enough space to move?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll make it work,” Merkatz said. “And when they arrive?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It will be up to you and your fleet, sir,” Yang said. “All you can do is try to break through. When you’ve formed up, take a spindle formation. We’ll hold them off until then, and when you’re ready, we’ll get out of the way so you can punch through. You might even be able to herd them back into the minefield— or if you can’t, just retreat in the other direction.” He didn’t really need to explain this to Merkatz, but he said it for the sake of the listening Vering, and Merkatz’s aide, standing at his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have any tricks? No secret plan to lead the mines like a pied piper into the enemy fleet?” Merkatz’s voice was tonelessly gruff as always, but he smiled, maybe an attempt to put Yang’s mind at ease.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a magician,” Yang said. “Just a tactician. And if I had anything like that up my sleeve, we wouldn’t have been wasting all our time with zephyr particles.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very true. Do you expect Littenheim has a…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang felt the telltale twitch of gravity as the ship’s engine worked to compensate for movement. As the ship engaged its faster than light engines, the picture of Merkatz warped and shifted and broke apart, leaving nothing but a smear of static and a tuneless buzz, which Yang stared at for a moment before looking up at Vering, who was clutching the back of a chair with white knuckles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How can he joke at a time like this?” Vering asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sit down, Lieutenant Commander,” Yang said. “Calm down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Yang’s words had the effect of making Vering angry, a red face was an improvement from a pale one, so Yang considered it a success. He stalked away from Yang, and went to go haunt the other side of the bridge, though Yang realized that Ansbach was right, and that he did need an eye kept on him. Yang watched him out of the corner of his eye, even when he went to talk to Braunschweig directly about the specifics of their fleet movement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They dropped back to sublight speeds almost immediately, then began the complicated process of turning their ships around. Luckily, there was still a few minutes before Littenheim’s fleet came within firing distance, and in that time, Yang received reports about how Merkatz’s fleet reorganization was going. It was slow, because any too-quick movements within the minefield could set off a chain reaction of destruction, but the fleet was coming together. If Braunschweig’s “rear guard” could hold the line for even forty minutes— thirty minutes— then Merkatz’s fleet could form a spindle, and break through Littenheim’s line. All they had to do was keep the fleet from forming up to pin Merkatz within the minefield.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The enemy ships were visible now, or at least they were on the peak magnification on the screen at the front of the bridge. Tiny swarms of light, almost like stars, but coming closer, faster and faster. The analysis of the data pouring in confirmed what Yang had already guessed about Littenheim’s fleet: it was slightly smaller than Braunschweig’s in number, by a few thousand ships. Surprisingly, there weren’t many bulky transport ships among their number, but perhaps that shouldn’t have been a surprise: Littenheim had arrived here first in time to put up the minefield, so all his many thousands of ground troops might already be on the other side, headed to Odin. If their ships were useless in a fight, there was no reason to keep them involved. He wondered where they would wait to meet up with Littenheim’s main fleet, if they were hiding, how many of them there were, and what kind of defenses they would encounter if they did try to land on Odin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For Yang, it was this logic puzzle which kept him in the ideal state of distraction and focus. If he didn’t have something to think through, his eyes would settle vacantly on the ships ahead, and it would begin to weigh on his heart. Some other people on the bridge were not lucky enough to have this train of thought to chase. Vering stood, staring at the screen, slack jawed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t surprise Yang that he was having this reaction. After all, Geiersburg, for all it had been a victory, had taken the fearless wind out of many people’s sails. And in that battle, they hadn’t fired shots of their own, for the most part. It hadn’t been fleet on fleet like this, and it was completely different to watch the enemy approach than it was to do the approaching.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking at Vering, Yang asked himself if he was afraid. He couldn’t find an answer, or he didn’t want to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ships came closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long until they enter our zephyr cloud?” Braunschweig asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Forty seconds,” the radar operator said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are we in firing range of that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are we out of range of the gas?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Affirmative, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although it felt to the onlookers that Littenheim’s fleet should slow as they approached the invisible danger, they plowed directly into the cloud, unaware of its presence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fire!” Braunschweig ordered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bright beams that lanced out into space felt like the first real shots of the civil war. This was against their true opponent, meeting him in battle for the first time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since the zephyr particles were so dispersed in space, it took an unusually long moment for the chain reaction to ignite the cloud, but then it did, blooming like a rose, consuming the first few rows of Littenheim’s fleet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The chaos, too, took a moment to unfold. Ships still accelerating behind the explosion began to change course as quickly as their hukling masses would allow, pitching and rolling to avoid the debris of the disabled ships that had been caught in the blast. This spoke to poor management of a hodgepodge fleet more than anything— clearly Littenheim’s fleet was not disciplined enough to maintain formation at all cost. The effects of the front lines breaking ranks traveled backwards, until the cameras on the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> could no longer pick out the movements of individual ships in the crowd. The movement of the fleet slowed: a commander must be yelling at them to get back in line.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s trick had done its work at least, bought them a little more time. Every second that they could gather would mean more of a chance for Merkatz to form his own lines.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the disorder among Littenheim’s fleet hadn’t lasted long, and though they had momentarily slowed, they did not stop their advance, even as Braunschweig’s ships fired again and again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wall of ships moving towards them soon overwhelmed the zoom of the cameras. Though the camera backed out further and further, the ships still somehow managed to fill the entire screen, no matter how many times the magnification was reduced.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They couldn’t retreat, but if they didn’t move, they were sitting targets for the enemy’s guns, so it was no surprise that Braunschweig ordered their paltry rear guard forward, focusing their fire and trying to open a weak spot in Littenheim’s line for Merkatz. Yang glanced behind himself at the display that showed Merkatz’s position— painfully slowly, the ships were gathering together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the actual battle began, Yang stopped paying attention to Merkatz’s progress. All he could do was watch what was happening in front of them. The outside world, though seen through cameras, became a confusing jumble, ships coming close to each other, swerving away, fire streaking out, bright flares when ships were hit. The soundscape was disjointed from the image— like watching a silent movie in a theater— the only sounds to accompany the death-scenes of ships in front of them were the inrushed breaths and choked exhales of the onlookers on the bridge of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The flagship was under fire, but the navigator kept them safe from the worst of it, and their shields deflected some, though the power draw of doing so made the whole ship’s gravity shudder underfoot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though he wasn’t in command, and there wasn’t much more he could do in his advisory position, Yang didn’t lose track of the battle situation. Braunschweig, to his credit, wasn’t making mistakes when he directed the focus of fire of his ships, and tried his best to keep them in a position where they wouldn’t be picked down. But even if he didn’t make mistakes, there were no good choices he could make, no orders that would win the day. Their rear guard was two thousand ships against Littenheim’s force five or six times greater than that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the ship directly to the right of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> exploded under concentrated fire, the blinding light of its engines giving way briefly blacked out the flagship’s cameras, leaving the bridge blind to the carnage outside. Most people tensed, waiting for a blow that they wouldn’t be able to see coming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang, able to tear himself away from watching for the first time, scanned the bridge and realized that Hans von Vering was missing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was a problem. There were only so many places it would make sense for a panicked Vering to go, and at least one of them would be a certain death sentence. Though Braunschweig probably wouldn’t mind if Vering did something to get himself killed, it would be a major problem for Count Mariendorf’s efforts to recruit allies. The elder Vering would not take kindly to his son’s death, and would have the power to tear the Braunschweig alliance apart financially.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang left the bridge just as the cameras regained power and a flickering image of the outside world reappeared overhead. The chaos of the fight would continue, regardless of Yang’s presence. He couldn’t affect the battle one way or another at this point, but he could make himself care about Hans von Vering.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hallways of the ship were strangely quiet, now that everyone was at their battle stations. The only evidence that the ship was even under attack was the occasional shudder of the gravity engine, either from moving the ship or deflecting a blow. It was a disconcerting sensation, but it made it very easy for Yang to cross the entire length of the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There in the rear were the shuttles, including the one reserved for Braunschweig’s personal use. They all sat nestled in their launchpads in the small bay, unattended at the moment. Surprisingly, Vering had already managed to break into Braunschweig’s shuttle: Yang could see him through the front window, sitting at the helm and looking completely overwhelmed. His movements were erratic as he poked at the buttons in front of him, presumably trying to get the ship to launch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t notice Yang until he climbed the steps up to the shuttle door, leaned over the handrail sideways, and rapped on the front window. Vering didn’t stop what he was doing, and maybe even redoubled his efforts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It should have been Ansbach here instead, Yang thought. Ansbach almost certainly knew the code that would open the shuttle door. Yang had to resort to yelling, hoping to be heard through the thick glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me in!” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering could hear him. He shook his head wildly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know the launch code!” Yang yelled. “I can help you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering hesitated for a moment, then yelled back, “Why?” His voice was so muffled, Yang only barely understood him, half through the movements of his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to get out of here!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering ignored him again and went back to pushing buttons on the console for a minute, or at least hovering his hand over them. Yang couldn’t see if he was making any progress with launching the shuttle. Yang banged on the window again. “I can help you launch it!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At this moment, the ship’s gravity fluctuated again, and Yang lurched, almost falling over the railing. He clutched it until the ship stabilized, and when he looked back up, Vering had gone even paler. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on,” Yang pleaded. “Open the door.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, miraculously, Vering did. The door of the shuttle slid open, and Yang stumbled inside and closed it behind himself. He took a seat in the copilot’s chair at the front of the shuttle, then leaned back and sighed, draping his arm over his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The launch code!” Vering demanded, then hissed in a breath as the ship was rocked again. “The launch code!” he said again a second later, and Yang lifted his arm off his face to realize that Vering was pointing his sidearm at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Put that away,” Yang said. Vering didn’t lower the gun at all, and his finger itched towards the trigger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell me what the code is!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang dropped his arm back over his face. “I don’t know it. Don’t you think that if I knew it, I’d also know how to open the door myself?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering made a sound that was halfway between a whine and a snarl. Yang was probably closer to death in that moment than he had been in many years— Vering was perfectly capable of shooting him, and possibly willing, too. But Yang didn’t move, didn’t lift his arm to look, and just waited.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Put the gun down,” he said after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not going to shoot me, so I don’t know why you need to keep pointing it at me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stopping you from killing yourself, or getting yourself killed,” Yang said. He held out his other hand blindly. “The gun, please. Well, actually, the energy pack. You can keep the gun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing was placed into Yang’s hand, but he heard Vering slump down into the seat next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re going to die,” Vering said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Yang replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ship rocked again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t get out of here.” Vering’s voice was almost completely overtaken by panic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. And if you did, this is interstellar space. This shuttle can’t get you back to Odin, even if you didn’t get shot down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to die,” he said, choking on the words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good,” Yang said. “Yeah. That’s good. I don’t want to die, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Yang lifted his arm to look at the boy, he found Vering sobbing with his face in his hands, his shoulders shaking as he tried and failed to get enough air with each breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat together in Braunschweig’s shuttle, feeling the ship sway and rock, otherwise oblivious to the world outside. They sat there until Merkatz’s fleet broke through Littenheim’s line, and pushed them back into the minefield, where they used a failsafe to disable their mines, and retreated to Odin. But Yang wouldn’t learn of this until many hours later.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <em>
    <span>November 488 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though Reuenthal was sure that his name was on a secret list somewhere of men who should be given no information, news reached him quickly. His desk job in the Ministry of War still provided him with a host of underlings, all of whom ate in the basement cafeteria and wandered the building on their business, and some of whom could even be trusted to deliver news to Reuenthal when they heard it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of Reuenthal’s closest subordinates was a stocky man with reddish-brown hair named Bergengrun, who had been given to Reuenthal as a way of getting rid of a problem. He was younger than Reuenthal by a few years, and was a captain. One might say he was a captain “already”, because he was young, but that seemed as far as he would get. He had risen to the rank through the usual skill and luck, but it was the combination of a common name and a too-quick temper when drunk that had halted his forward career progress in its tracks. It hadn’t been enough to have him removed from the fleet, but it had been enough to make him enemies, including among his former superiors. Very few nobles in the Imperial fleet appreciated subordinates who spoke whatever disagreements were on their minds. Reuenthal found it useful, for the most part.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bergengrun was friends with another captain in the building. That captain was among the first to receive the report that a fleet was limping into the space around Odin, and that Odin’s own, relatively paltry, defense fleet would be sortieing to meet it. When Bergengrun got his hands on a copy of this information, it ended up on Reuenthal’s desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Several things became immediately clear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>First— it was Littenheim’s fleet that was en route to Odin. Their satellites throughout the system picked up the image of his flagship on their cameras. His fleet looked battered, and was missing a significant part of its number.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Second— Littenheim’s fleet was coming to Odin in a flight of desperation. If it had not been a harried rush to escape a larger threat, if Littenheim had won whatever engagement had scarred his fleet so badly, he would have stopped before approaching the planet and made an announcement that he had defeated Braunschweig and demand that Lichtenlade turn over the Imperial government to him. There was no announcement, so it seemed that Littenheim was planning to use the only remaining resource he had— ground troops, and the foothold he had in the Military Police— to entrench himself on Odin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Third— Littenheim would be successful in getting to Odin. The defense fleet that had been left on the planet was paltry, hardly more than a token fleet of three thousand ships. Because of Odin’s protected nature within the Empire, it had never been a high priority to keep a large standing military force on the planet. In fact, it had been considered dangerous to do so— having a full stationed fleet on Odin, a planet where people could get ideas, increased the danger of a military coup by an order of magnitude. Muckenburger had raised the fleet presence in the system marginally before the civil war, but he had hoped to avoid a major conflict between the remains of the Imperial government and either of the dueling families, so had not done as much as he could have. Even though Littenheim’s fleet was battered, it was still more than a match for Odin’s ships and the relatively junior commander in charge of them, a vice admiral whose name Reuenthal had only ever heard in passing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fourth— once Littenheim arrived on Odin, the planet would be under his control, at least physically. The Military Police had, even before the civil war, functioned as a combination of secret police and the most significant military presence on the planet. Outside of Neue Sanssouci, they were the Kaiser’s personal force on Odin. Since Kaiser Friedrich, to whom they had nominally reported, was dead, Littenheim controlled the military police, and this left Lichtenlade with little military strength—  he only controlled the few small ground units of the Fleet on Odin, the Neue Sanssouci guards, and whatever city police units would obey him when they came under fire. It wasn’t much, and it certainly wasn’t enough to stop Littenheim’s army from occupying the capital.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, that didn’t mean that Lichtenlade was going to surrender. Lichtenlade’s plan was to turn things over to the victor, and even an occupation of Neue Sanssouci was not a sign of victory. Littenheim retreating to Odin gave Braunschweig as much time and space as he needed to gather resources, and a large enough army, to eventually crush his rival. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the end of the day, it seemed like the whole building had heard the news. Every man in the building was either rushing around like he was being drawn forward by invisible high-tension strings— twanging around corners and vibrating with the energy held in the cords— or had withdrawn into himself. When Reuenthal walked out, he passed men huddled in corners speaking in hushed voices, and a man leaning against walls with one arm thrown over his head while their other pressed his phone to his ear and whispered something to his wife. Everyone talking about secrets that everyone knew.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal walked out in the strangely peaceful late November evening, pulling his coat tight around his shoulders to stave off the chill. Looking behind himself as he left the building, he wondered how many times he would return there. Not many, he was sure. Already, there were people packing up every sensitive document in the building, moving them into secure storage far outside the capital city, deep underground, in places Littenheim wouldn’t be able to access even if he took control of the whole planet. Those wouldn’t be unsealed until Muckenburger, or whoever succeeded Muckenburger, gave his blessing to the new order. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rather than going home, Reuenthal drove the opposite direction, through the city. Even now, things seemed normal— a few pedestrians running their errands through the grim and snowy air, at shops that remained resolutely open. For Reuenthal, the last edges of normalcy had fallen away, and everyone now was walking around clinging to an illusion. It couldn’t last much longer, and knowing that was almost a relief. It made things clearer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He drove towards the part of the city where expensive townhouses lined tree-shaded streets. Some of these were the city homes of the nobility who kept country mansions elsewhere, and some were the only homes of the lesser nobility, or the wealthiest echelons of commoners, or Phezzani merchants who had a presence on Odin. The exteriors were, unlike the countryside manor houses, not ostentatious. The location announced the wealth of the owner far better than any facade could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal parked on the street outside one of these houses, braced himself for an unpleasant task, and walked up the tall set of steps to ring the bell. If Elfriede had not been living in his house, he would have insisted that they meet there instead, but she left him with little choice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An old butler answered the door, inclined his head to Reuenthal, and let him in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He is expecting you, sir,” the butler said. “If you’ll come this way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal followed him through the house. It was dark inside— the overhead lights were dim, and the wooden paneling on the walls swallowed what little light there was. What of the house Reuenthal could see was old, tasteful, and well kept. A few paintings and photographs lined the walls, but none of them were people whom Reuenthal recognized.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The butler knocked on, then opened, the door to the office, deep into the house. Reuenthal stepped inside, and the butler swiftly left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come here, Dog,” Oberstein said from his seat at the desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The command was not for Reuenthal— it was for the wobbling old Dalmatian that was standing in front of him, blocking his path forward. Reuenthal wasn’t sure if the dog’s stance was out of curiosity or threat, but it didn’t matter to Reuenthal either way. He didn’t like dogs much, and he waited until the animal registered Oberstein’s command and walked with arthritic legs over to lay its head in his lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was only then that Reuenthal had a chance to look around the office, and realized that the lights were even dimmer here than they were in the hallway. Only a single floor lamp was on, near the door, and probably for the sake of the dog. Oberstein had his eyes closed— or he closed his eyelids over the sunken holes that usually held his eyes. The mechanical replacements were soaking in a cup of water at his elbow. Oberstein had a tablet in front of him, although the screen was completely black. He tapped on it twice, apparently issuing some kind of invisible command, then moved it aside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were expecting me?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew you would come. Please, take a seat, Rear Admiral.” He made no motion to stand or salute, despite their difference in ranks. “I’m sure that the lieutenant will be here presently.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you invite him?” Reuenthal asked, taking a seat in the chair in front of Oberstein’s desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll come. He has his own ways of hearing the news. He may still be delivering it to everyone who needs to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I believe the commodore left him with explicit instructions to watch over a certain list of people. Since time is not of the essence right now, I can’t fault him for obeying. But you and I can talk before he arrives.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t want to wait for him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Oberstein said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very well.” Reuenthal leaned back in his seat and looked around the room some more. There was a large family photograph hanging behind Oberstein’s desk— an older man in uniform (a vice admiral), a slender woman next to him, and a young boy standing in front, the woman’s hands grasping his shoulders. A dog, a black lab, leaned its head against the child’s hips. The child was clearly Oberstein as a youth, though the boy had wide-open brown eyes, not the blue ones in the jar that Reuenthal couldn’t help but glance at with revulsion. The family photograph was easier to look at than Oberstein or anything else, so it was to that which he addressed his comments. “Littenheim will be here in a few days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There won’t be much resistance. Lichtenlade will find somewhere to hide.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But will he be able to? If he or his child-kaiser dies, the rest of the government will surrender to Littenheim, which will make the whole fleet go after Braunschweig. That’s the only way that he can win, with his fleet in the condition it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lichtenlade will be well hidden,” Oberstein said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re very confident. The MPs know where all of the government safehouses are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But not the Lichtenlade family’s personal secrets,” Oberstein said. “I expect that he has been careful for many years preparing for this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Secrets are a hard thing to keep around here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you asking if we should throw our support behind Lichtenlade?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reuenthal said, though he had been wondering if Oberstein would suggest it. “I just wonder how long he can hold out, and how long Leigh’s plan is going to take.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I believe he would have left for Iserlohn immediately after his battle with Littenheim,” Oberstein said. “It won’t take more than a few weeks for him to arrive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did he tell you that’s where he’s going?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s the only place for him to go. Even attacking Littenheim’s lands or allies wouldn’t draw him off of Odin, so there’s nothing he can do without ground troops to fight in the capital. The ones that aren’t keeping Braunschweig’s own lands in order are trapped in the corridor. Attacking Iserlohn is a threefold solution— reuniting with his forces, perhaps convincing Lichtenlade to back Braunschweig after that demonstration of power, and being able to make the threat of an alliance with the rebels to claim the throne.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal was about to respond when the doorbell rang. The Dalmatian immediately lifted its hoary head from Oberstein’s lap and limped over to the door of the office, waiting to investigate the visitor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The lieutenant,” Oberstein said, though that was obvious. It would take a long minute for the butler to retrieve the intruder and escort him to the office. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Reuenthal said, then waited in silence, staring up at the picture of Oberstein’s family. The silence pressed on him far too much, and so he asked, “Is that a photo of your family behind you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Myself, my father Alfred, and my mother Emmeline.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Out of a morbid curiosity, he commented, “You changed the color of your prosthetic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Oberstein said. “I still had my eyes then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh told me you were born blind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was, but not without eyes. Since the risk of complications was great for the brain implant, my mother insisted that the procedure not be performed until I was older.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How thoughtful of her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A clever blind child was easier to tolerate than a sighted idiot,” Oberstein said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you chose blue eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She chose them. There was no reason to pick a less desirable color, and there has been no reason for me to change since.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal was grateful for the sound of footsteps in the hallway, the butler and Lieutenant Kircheis. The dog let out a soft woof as the door swung open. Kircheis saluted at the entrance, though he held out his other hand for the dog to sniff, not bothered by it at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral Reuenthal— I didn’t know you were going to be here,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have things to talk about, don’t we?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take a seat, Lieutenant,” Oberstein said. Kircheis did, taking the seat next to Reuenthal. His eyes, too, lingered on the eyeballs in a cup at Oberstein’s elbow, though the dog followed him to his seat, and Kircheis scratched its head absently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve heard the news, I assume,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“From whom? You don’t work in the Ministry of War, and Leigh can’t contact the planet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral Bronner told me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s unclear who he’s working for,” Reuenthal commented.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think he’s working for anyone. But he tells me what’s going on, and he doesn’t have any reason to lie about things I can confirm myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Be careful that when you confirm things you aren’t also giving him information about what you know,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did Leigh leave you with any instructions for this eventuality?” Oberstein asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Some,” Kircheis said. “He wrote a lot about what he thought would happen to the civilian government, but he understood that there isn’t much that he can do on Odin without agents on the ground. Even the resources he has— I don’t think anybody on the planet can access money from the Braunschweigs or Count Vering.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if we could access money, it isn’t worth much, or it won’t be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Commodore Leigh knows that. But he couldn’t keep a standing force on the planet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So he wrote that we should sit on our hands,” Reuenthal said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir,” Kircheis said, but didn’t elaborate on what Yang had written. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are very few things that we can do,” Oberstein said. “At best, with our limited number of allies, if it came to be that we needed to join forces with Lichtenlade, we might be able to shelter him. Or perform small guerrilla actions against Littenheim’s forces.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“None of that is necessary now,” Reuenthal pointed out. “Though we should prepare for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I agree,” Oberstein said. He tipped his blind face towards Kircheis. “I understand that the commodore has already had some resources laid away?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis nodded, then said, “Yes, sir,” for Oberstein’s sake. “There’s caches in some of the Braunschweig family’s safehouses. I know where they are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s hope we don’t need to use them,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I agree.” Oberstein turned his face back towards Reuenthal. “The only other thing we can do for the commodore now is coordinate. We on Odin can still speak with most other places in the galaxy, at least for now. Is there anything that Leigh needs to capture Iserlohn that we could send him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence. Reuenthal turned to Kircheis. “His plan is a pincer attack on Iserlohn? Bait out the fleet on one side, and rush the fortress from the other?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And he has enough ships in the corridor already?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir. He believes it’s enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And who is the commander of the forces on that side of the corridor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence, and Kircheis said, “Uh— it’s one of Duke Braunschweig’s— I can find his name—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A nobody,” Reuenthal said. “Is this someone that Leigh trusts for a reason?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again, for a moment, Kircheis was silent. “I don’t believe so, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But Leigh is confident in this plan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wanted a different commander there, sir,” Kircheis admitted. “But Duke Braunschweig wouldn’t send one before the Kaiser died.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So Leigh is going to try a two pronged assault without the second prong assisting. Is that what he intends?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He— well. I think he intended to bait the rebel forces in the corridor into providing a distraction— he had some system of feigned distress calls left on Cahokia for that—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He needs a commander there who can execute this,” Reuenthal said. “The rebels can’t be relied on.” Already, a plan was ticking forward in his mind, though it began with a slight sting of jealousy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And who do you suggest?” Oberstein asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral Mittermeyer,” Reuenthal said. “He has ships under his command, and Leigh would vouch for his skill. We could send him a message, and he could provide the other half of Leigh’s pincer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How would he get there?” Kircheis asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are two corridors through space, aren’t there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is a difficult and long journey,” Oberstein said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mittermeyer is capable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But waiting for him to arrive will cause Littenheim to fully entrench himself on Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let him,” Reuenthal said. “It’s Muckenburger in Iserlohn who really wields the power to surrender the Imperial forces to Braunschweig, no matter what ruling power Lichtenlade claims to hold. Once he’s hidden away in whatever hole he has prepared, he won’t be able to issue commands any longer, or won’t be able to enforce them, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how will we communicate to the commodore that we’re putting this idea in motion for him?” Oberstein asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Mariendorf has ways of contacting Duke Braunschweig,” Kircheis said. “He’s trying to gather support for Braunschweig with the frontier nobles. We can send a message through him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And the rear admiral himself?” Oberstein asked. “How will he be told?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal’s lip curled in distaste. “His wife,” he said. “She can send him a letter any time she chooses. That’s not out of the ordinary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll give her a message to send,” Kircheis volunteered. “Commodore Leigh told me to make sure she’s out of the city, so I’ll be seeing her anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal made no comment on that.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was pitch dark outside when Reuenthal left Oberstein’s house, and snowing, though the flakes that hit the windshield of his car melted and disappeared immediately. When he arrived at his house, he was unpleasantly surprised to find another car parked in the driveway: a nondescript black vehicle which bore an official fleet plate. Reuenthal drove past his house, hoping he was unnoticed, parked his car on the street some distance away, then crept up around the back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The light was on in the kitchen, but Reuenthal entered through the basement staircase, lifting the metal bunker-like door from the ground as quietly as he could, then leaving it open on the snow. He descended the steps quickly, then entered the wine cellar. He didn’t bother turning on the light— he knew the place by instinct. Before he reached the front stairs up to the kitchen, he took off his shoes and pulled his sidearm from its holster, flicking off the safety.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silently, he crept up the stairs and listened at the top.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A man’s voice, someone he didn’t recognize. “Fraulein Kohlrausch, I can assure you that your grand-uncle and the rest of your family are only concerned for your safety.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede. “And that’s why they sent an armed man here to drag me back. To keep me in whatever prison they’ve devised.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It seems as though you’re the one threatening me with a weapon, Fraulein.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you don’t have a gun under your coat?” A moment of silence. “Don’t move! Don’t move at all!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here,” the man said,.  A thump of something heavy hitting the table, and then Elfriede’s light footsteps as she walked forward. “I hope you’ll give that back to me when I leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you had been ordered to drag me out of here. You’d get it back then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t do that to a friend of a friend,” the man said. “That is why I volunteered to come, rather than someone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And whose friend are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Countess von Leigh’s.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede made a dismissive sound. “She’s not my friend. And she didn’t tell me you were coming. I don’t really believe you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you won’t come back with me, I’ll tell your grand-uncle that I couldn’t find you. But I’m afraid that I’ll be signing your death sentence by doing so. You are aware that Rear Admiral Reuenthal is known to be an agent of Duke Braunschweig’s? This place won’t be safe, when his enemies arrive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede’s voice rose in pitch. “You’re very stupid if you think that my grand-uncle has a better chance of surviving than I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s going to be well protected.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know where he’s going,” Elfriede said. “I’m not as confident as he is. And I’m not the kind of animal to walk into a cage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what is this house?” the man asked. “I’m told you don’t ever go out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal was tempted to emerge from the staircase into the kitchen, but he waited. He wanted to hear what she would say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m the kind of animal that will chew her leg off to get out of a trap,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you think you could leave here, if you needed to, or wanted to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed. “You misunderstand me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I apologize.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is me using my teeth,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man seemed at a loss for words for a moment. “You could be a poet, Fraulein.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was the sound of something hitting the table again, though thrown from a few feet away this time. “You should leave now. He’ll be home soon, and you don’t want to be here when he is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like to meet the Rear Admiral. I have a message for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I have the energy pack?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Footsteps. “Your grand-uncle does care about you, and so does the rest of your family,” the man said. “If you change your mind, you know where you can go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t,” she said. “And don’t come looking for me again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Other people won’t be quite so willing to let you slip out of their hands,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t like threats, Captain. You should leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight, Fraulein.” He walked to the front door. Reuenthal heard it creak open. “I hope you’re correct.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The cages,” he said. The front door shut, and Elfriede’s footsteps crossed the kitchen floor once again. A chair creaked as she sat down at the table, and then there was silence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal waited for some time before creeping back down the stairs, climbing out of the basement, and retrieving his car. He parked it in the driveway and entered the house through the kitchen door, as was his usual route. He found Elfriede sitting at the table in her diaphanous white nightgown, the one that had once belonged to his mother, which she had found somewhere in the house. One of the large kitchen knives was on the table in front of her, and she seemed to be staring down at her reflection in the blade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Planning to stab me?” Reuenthal asked. The words snapped her out of whatever trance she was in, and she grabbed the knife. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Castrate you,” she said. There wasn’t enough venom in it, so he answered in kind as he took off his coat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re about twenty years too late to make me sing like a castrati, and I have no interest in children anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed, but there was a wild edge to the sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal went to stand over by the sink, looking out the window at the darkness. “Leigh beat Littenheim in space.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really?” She knew this already. She was planning to lie to him. He wondered what the best time to reveal that he knew about her visitor would be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Littenheim’s retreating to Odin. He’ll be here in a few days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you afraid?” she taunted. This, too, came out wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He walked up behind her, and slid his hands down her arms until he reached her hands, still holding the knife upright in front of herself, the butt of the handle resting on the table. His chest pressed against her back, and he could feel her breathing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Littenheim is walking himself into a trap. He’s not going to get out alive,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tensed beneath him. “He doesn’t think that way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nobody ever does.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” His hands tightened on her wrists. “Are you a counterexample?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. But you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In what way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?” she asked. “In this house?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“With you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell me what I’m doing, if you have something to say about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t think there’s a world outside the trap, so you pretend you’re strong to stay alive inside it.” She laughed again. “I’m not as stupid as you are, Oskar.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And are you going to say you’re stronger than me, too?” He crushed her wrists with his hands, but she didn’t loosen her grip on the knife. He wasn’t sure that he wanted her to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a weakness that runs in your family,” she said. “Your mother—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nevermind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With surprising strength, Elfriede lifted her arms off the table, swinging the tip of the knife abruptly towards Reuenthal’s face. The sight of the blade coming towards his eye horrified him, and he let go of her and stumbled back. She let her hands fall back down to the table, and dropped the knife with a clatter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You said she almost killed you,” Elfriede said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal tried to compose himself, walked around in front of Elfriede, and picked up the knife. She didn’t try to stop him, though she watched him. Testing himself, Reuenthal brought the blade to the corner of his brown eye. “She almost cut it out,” he said. “She wasn’t trying to kill me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She would have been free if she had.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal pressed the knife to the skin at the corner of his eye, still over the bone. The blade was dull— it would take real effort to cut, unless his hand slipped, but his hand was very steady. “Getting rid of the evidence wouldn’t free her from her sin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede’s face twisted in disgust, and she stood. “That’s not what I’m talking about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she started to walk away, Reuenthal grabbed her. She didn’t struggle, but she did tense, genuinely afraid this time. Reuenthal held the knife to her chin, the point pressing into her skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you not going to tell me about your visitor?” Reuenthal asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She breathed heavily in his arms for a moment before she said anything. “Did he wait on the street for you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Reuenthal held the knife steady, talking made it prick her skin. A drop of blood slipped down the edge of the blade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Reuenthal said. “I saw there was someone in the house, so I came in through the basement.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wanted to catch me in the act.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The idea that Elfriede might be cheating on him hadn’t crossed his mind, and was almost laughable. “Yes,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With his other hand, he pulled up her nightgown, slipped his hand underneath it, and trailed his hand across the smooth expanse of her stomach until he reached her breast, which he squeezed roughly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How much of the conversation did you hear?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then you know I wasn’t planning to leave you.” She struggled against him, but it wasn’t with real force, and Reuenthal kept the knife to her chin until she pushed his arm down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dropped the knife back to the kitchen table. “Whatever captain that was is right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She made a noise of disagreement and pushed against him, trying again to get out of his arms. “I don’t care,” she said. “You’re not going to send me back to my family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” he said. “But you shouldn’t stay in the city. We’re both enemies of Littenheim.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She snarled. “I’m not going to be locked up in some hole.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” he said, and he let her go. She stumbled forward a few steps, and turned back towards him, but he was already walking away. She didn’t follow him all the way to his office, where he spent the remainder of the evening, poring over the information that Kircheis and Bergengrun had provided. Although he looked at it carefully, he couldn’t keep other thoughts from drifting through his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he got ready for bed, he leaned on the counter in the bathroom, nude, staring into his own reflection. He pulled down the lower lid of his eye with one finger, looking at the veiny underside of his eyeball, the red flesh, imagining it replaced with an empty hollow— or a blue replacement. The thought sickened him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door to the bathroom was ajar, and Elfriede walked past, then stopped as she saw him performing this strange little ritual. She entered the bathroom and sat on the counter next to where he leaned. Delicately, she replaced her finger with his on his face. He kept looking straight ahead, into his reflection. She kept the lid of his eye pulled down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You told that captain that you’d bite off your leg to get out of a trap,” Reuenthal said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your station for your freedom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or something like it,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you say I’m keeping myself in a trap.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What would I have to give up to get out of it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing as easy as cutting out your eye,” she said. She shifted her hand so that she was covering his eye with her palm. He closed his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t answer the question. Her other hand found his hair and stroked it, oddly tender. “Where would you say that I should hide, when Littenheim arrives?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The country house where Leigh’s wife is,” Reuenthal said. “Leigh thinks it’s safe enough there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And will you come?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” he said.</span>

  <em>
    <span>December 488 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The apartment Evangeline Mittermeyer shared with her husband was not large or ostentatious— in fact, it was smaller and cheaper than the lodgings of probably any other rear admiral in the Imperial fleet— but it was home. The walls held photographs of friends and family, interspersed with paintings that Eva herself had made, or that she found particularly pleasing. The wooden floors were warmed by colorful woven rugs, and every afternoon she would make her rounds watering the flowering plants that hung in macrame bowls near the windows. Even though her husband was often away, she tried to make the place a haven, one where she never felt </span>
  <em>
    <span>lonely</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Her home was cheerful and warm, and if she ever needed, she could call on any number of friends to visit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Most of the time, this worked. Or she pretended it worked, which would have to be enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But now, as December closed in on Odin, that last comfort seemed to have fallen away. It had been ebbing ever since her husband had been sent off on his most recent duty— out to an experimental starship construction facility. It was somewhere that she couldn’t locate on a map no matter how many times Wolf pointed out to her the star in the night sky that it orbited. Her sense of peace had throbbed keenly when the Kaiser died, and Hank had left the planet with only a text message of warning. Maggie departed the capital city not long after, headed for a countryside retreat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But now none of that sense of calm remained. Eva had clung to normalcy as much as she could, but it had slipped out of her grip at last.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stood at the window and anxiously pulled back the curtains with one hand, looking up into the night. Flakes of snow were drifting down, but even through the thin cloud cover, bright flashes of light illuminated the horizon and sky above— a battle that was raging right up to the edge of the planet’s atmosphere. Odin’s surface defensive guns were shooting at Marquis Littenheim’s ships as they descended towards the city. Even at this great distance, even through the thick glass of her window, Eva could smell the harsh ozone created by the guns blasting through the air. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her other hand clutched at her tablet, and she kept waking up the screen with her thumb every time it went dim. It was open to her messages, and one long message from her husband in particular.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The beginning half of the letter was a response to Lieutenant Kircheis, telling Eva to reassure him that the coded message she had helped pass was understood, and that he was going to act on it. The second half of the letter was personal. Although Eva tended to read his letters many times in general, this one had not left her hand since she received it, and she kept looking at it over and over, trying to divine its meaning.</span>
</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Eva, I know I’ve said it a hundred million times before, but I can’t tell you how much you mean to me. If I had a way with words like Leigh does, I’d figure some way out to write it down. Maybe you’re like the stars in the sky, or I need you like I need to breathe, or something like that. I’m not a poet, and maybe that’s why I’m a soldier. Even when I’m trapped out here tinkering with machines, pretending not to be a soldier for a while, I don’t have to think too much about the heart and the things it does. That’s good, because if I think about it too much, I start missing you more than I can bear.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I know I can bear it, but I don’t want to have to. It’s hard not to know when I’ll get to see you again. I hope this little war is over quickly, and Leigh does too, but there’s no way for me to say for sure if it will be. That’s what makes it difficult— not knowing when we’ll get out the other side.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I keep thinking about this conversation I had with Reuenthal before Leigh’s wedding. We were talking about what things would be like after all of this. Back then, I told him that I didn’t know what life would look like. I couldn’t picture it, and I just wanted to be happy. But I think I’ve figured it out, what I want. It’s the kind of thing I always dream of when I’m out in space, but I think it’s worse this time because I’m by myself— it makes me see things differently.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I know if Leigh was reading this letter he’d be sighing and giving me that funny little smile he has— I’ve had this conversation with him more times than I can really count, and I don’t know how he stays patient with me. It’s what I talked about with him when I ran away to stay at his house after proposing to you— do you remember that? It felt like the right thing to do at the time, but in hindsight I know it must have made me look stupid. Mom later said it must have just been that I stomped all my nerves down so that I could go through with asking, and then as soon as the pressure stopped holding them in, they exploded, regardless of you saying yes. That wasn’t it, but it makes more sense than what it was that made me run away.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I think I need to stop doing this. I’ve tried— gods know I’ve tried— before, but I’ve never managed to do it. Maybe that’s because I’m always having this conversation with Leigh instead of with you. When I get home, when all this is over, I should talk about it with you. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I don’t think it will be too long until then. This war can’t last very long, and Leigh is going to win, and then— it can be a different world we live in. Leigh’s dreaming of something too— he wants to sue for peace with the rebels. Maybe then us soldiers will be out of a job. That might be a good thing.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Please stay safe on Odin. If Leigh’s little lieutenant tells you to do something— do it. Or Reuenthal. I know he can be difficult, but he would help you if you needed help. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I love you so much, forever and always,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Your Wolf</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>The letter felt like the direst possible portent. It had always seemed like bad luck, as a soldier’s wife, to ever discuss anything but the most mundane things that would happen “after” a deployment. She never wanted to make a promise that could be broken by fate, and it seemed unbelievably cruel to make her wait for whatever he wanted to talk about, to bring up the subject and leave her with the responsibility of holding its weight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t that she didn’t know. She knew.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least, she knew the shape of it, off in the distance, like a shadow on the wall. She couldn’t see what was casting it, but she knew it was there. When she had become aware of it, she couldn’t quite say. Had it been since before she had been married? Yes, probably.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had read it in his eyes the day he proposed to her. That warm, bright May day, five years ago, standing in the garden behind the house. He had been so afraid— not afraid of her, but afraid of himself. His hands shook when he held out the flowers to her, and he asked to marry her like he was asking for forgiveness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the night of Maggie and Hank’s wedding, having been reminded of the subject by the events of the day, she had felt bold enough to ask him about that. They had come home exhausted and a little drunk, falling onto the couch in a tangle of limbs, still in their party clothes. The rain had been beating down at the window that night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you enjoy the wedding?” Wolf asked her as she lay on his lap, looking up into his eyes. He should have tried to get her dress off, but both of them were too tired to move, yet too awake to make their way to bed. It was a strange mood that gripped her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did,” she said. “I’m so happy for them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wolf smiled— funny— the melancholy coming out when tiredness allowed it. “They’re a good match. It took them long enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe they were right to wait until now, and you were in a rush,” she said with an answering smile. She reached up one lazy hand and brushed her fingers through his hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would have waited for you, you know,” she said. “You were so nervous that day you asked me. You didn’t have to be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I hadn’t gotten my courage up then, I’m not sure I ever would have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmm.” She let her arm fall back down, and picked up his hand, heavy and warm. She kissed his knuckles, then held it to her chest. “I don’t understand why you were so afraid. Didn’t you know I would say yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was quiet for a long time, which was unusual for him. Only the movement of his thumb on her hand made it clear that he hadn’t fallen asleep right where he sat. “I was afraid because I knew that,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s very silly, Wolf.” She kissed his hand again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No— I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She waited, squeezing his fingers gently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It seemed like I wasn’t giving you a real choice,” he said. “I knew you would say yes— that made me feel bad for asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She splayed out his fingers and pressed his hand to her cheek. “I said yes because I love you, and wanted to marry you,” she said. “I had already made my choice, and I was glad to do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That had been the end of the conversation, but it had stuck with her since, and came back to her now as she stared out at Littenheim’s ships descending through the sky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wolf’s secrets— she loved him enough that she was willing to ignore that lurking </span>
  <em>
    <span>it</span>
  </em>
  <span> in the corner of her life. It sometimes seemed like he was taking refuge in her arms from </span>
  <em>
    <span>it</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and there was a part of her that was pleased to feel like she could provide that, some shelter from whatever storm was chasing him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried not to think about what it was, though she had her suspicions. Hank clearly knew, and so did Wolf’s friend Reuenthal. She couldn’t blame them for keeping his confidence— though Hank, especially, was apologetic whenever the subject slid sideways into their conversations. Even Reuenthal was frustrated with whatever Wolf’s secret shame was. She recalled his annoyance when they had spoken at the Solstice party the previous December: “You should tell your husband to stop keeping secrets.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva had this fantasy, or nightmare, about what the secret was— trying to fit all the clues together in her mind, or perhaps just dreaming of the thing that lived exactly on the edge of desire and misery. Maybe, she thought, he didn’t tell her the secret because it would make her too sad— the one thing she desperately wanted but could not give. Perhaps Wolf, as a boy in school, had fathered a child with some other woman, one that his friends knew about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sometimes pictured this child in her mind— always imagining a little girl. She might be ten now, looking just like her father— blonde hair pulled by the wind’s fingers when she ran, laughing, into some woman’s arms. The image made her weep, when it came to her strongly. Not so much out of jealousy, for this piece of her husband that some other woman had, but for the ten years she, too, might have known that child and loved her. She would have loved her as her own, Eva thought. She could have. There was no vindictive bone in her body; she felt entirely suffused with love, so much so that it wounded her, having nowhere to put it and no one to give it to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva was not a very religious woman, but on holidays when she might go to the temple, she’d sometimes look up at the statue of the goddess Freyja and think a silent prayer for the health of the child. That was all she did— she never mentioned it to Wolf.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She said one of those prayers now, watching the ships come down. They were through the clouds now— the first dark underbellies sinking through the sky, looking for any patch of open ground to land on. They weren’t headed towards the airfield— she could see them descending over the great park in the center of the capital city, and anywhere else that one of their bulks could fit. In hours, if not minutes, there would be soldiers in the streets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hours before, she had seen tanks trundle down the road, setting up blockades to protect important buildings, traps on the bridges, and barriers on the streets. Watching all this happen, Eva knew that she should have taken Lieutenant Kircheis’s advice and left the city days ago, but something had stopped her. She had told him that she would wait. She was hoping that Wolf would send her another message, but he didn’t, and now it was too late. There would likely be no more communication with anyone for a while, and Wolf was probably already on his way to Iserlohn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had, at least, packed her bag, so she was ready when she heard the quiet knock on her door, though it still made her jump. She reluctantly dropped the curtain back down and went to open the door. There was Lieutenant Kircheis, smiling wanly down at her— he really was so tall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good evening, Frau Mittermeyer,” he said. “May I come in?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’re here to tell me it’s time to leave, I packed my bag,” she said, but she held out the door so that he could step inside her apartment. Although he had been here before, checking up on her for Hank and her husband, he still moved himself very delicately, as if aware of his size and not wanting to break anything in her space. Eva wished she could see the apartment with his eyes instead of her own— a stranger’s place, rather than a home that she did not want to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid that we can’t leave the capital today,” Kircheis said. “The roads are all blocked.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She half pretended not to hear him. “Can I offer you some tea?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, thank you, Frau Mittermeyer. We should get moving. This won’t be easier if we wait.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are you taking me, if we can’t leave the city?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can’t leave by road, but we should be able to get out on foot in a few days. I arranged for Fraulein Mariendorf to meet us with a car outside the city,” Kircheis said. “Until then, we’ll wait in one of the safehouses that the Braunschweig family had prepared— it has a basement, in case there are bombings.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can drive there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Partway,” Kircheis said. “We’ll probably have to leave the car somewhere when we get close to the city limits— I saw that the traffic from people trying to leave on the highways has blocked up into the main streets. Nobody can get out, but nobody can turn around either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright.” She said that as if it was somehow alright. It wasn’t at all. Kircheis seemed calm, and she tried to be calm as well, but she wasn’t used to this. She wanted Wolf with her, not this boy, even if the boy was someone that Hank trusted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She disappeared into her bedroom for a minute, leaving Kircheis standing in the middle of her living room with his hands behind his back. Distantly, from far off in the city, there was a bone-groaning deep boom, one that made the windows rattle in their frames. When she came back into the living room, bag in hand, she found Kircheis looking out the window, in the same posture that she had been in earlier. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was that?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A ship went down,” Kirchesis said. He pointed to the horizon, where there was the glow of a fire burning in unnatural greens and purples, and the beginnings of a pillar of black smoke beginning to form. She looked at it, and Kircheis must have seen her tremble, or give some other sign of fear, because he said, “It’s alright, Frau Mittermeyer. I’ve got you. But we should go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, right.” She pulled on her coat. “Is there anything—” She looked around the apartment in despair, turning in a circle and looking at it all like she would never see it again. Her hands twitched out towards things, as if to grab them, but there was nothing else she could bring. The plants in their macrame bowls would wilt and die when she left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you need something later, I can get it for you,” Kircheis said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” she said. “Alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took her keys from the side of the fridge, and shut off all the lights and locked the doors. When they were in the hallway, there was another boom, louder, closer, but they couldn’t see it. Kircheis took her elbow and steered her out of the apartment, down towards the parking garage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They took her car, but Kircheis drove. He seemed to have knowledge of what streets were blocked and which were passable, because he took a circuitous route, weaving down side streets and moving in a great circle around the edge of the city. As they passed beneath the highway overpass which headed towards the river bridge, Eva could see above them the stalled line of car headlights, tracing the line of the bridge even though the decorative lights it usually bore were off. Some dark shadows walked along the edge of the bridge, both directions, fleeing for safety or changing their minds. In the center of the city, the roads had been almost deserted, and no lights were on in the windows, but as they got further towards the edge, Kircheis was right that the roads filled more and more, people disobeying any traffic laws and going wherever their cars would take them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was headed in a northerly direction. North— there were smaller bridge crossings many kilometers away, ones that might not be blocked with cars. But the highway there was inaccessible, and eventually Kircheis gave up on driving. He pulled her car to a park— a little place Eva had never been before, with the children’s swingset off in the distance, and the bare trees huddled against the snow. He hopped the curb, which made her yelp, and parked her car in a drift of snow beneath an old barren oak. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe no one will hit it, if it’s not on the street,” he said, and then handed her the keys.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright.” It seemed like the only thing that she could say. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s about four kilometers from here. Can you make it that far?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” She had put on boots, at least, and that made the going on the slick road easier. She walked pressed to the buildings, and Kircheis stood between her and the road, where the barely illuminated forms of car drivers menaced the few pedestrians who hurried through the line of barely moving cars. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Behind them, the sounds of the fighting had grown fiercer, and now a fine ash was mingling in with the snow that fell. Kircheis gave her his scarf, to pull over her nose when he noticed it accumulating as a crust on the freshly fallen snow on railings and the tops of garbage cans. She thought of protesting, and saying that he should have it, but she knew he wouldn’t allow her to do so.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You aren’t afraid,” she said as they walked. Maybe conversation would keep her mind off the terror at the back of her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve done this before, Frau Mittermeyer,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When Commodore Leigh rescued Count Mariendorf from Lord Castrop. When the Imperial fleet landed on Castrop’s planet, it was—” He cut himself off and said nothing more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Above them, a ship that had been hit by planetary fire and was half destroyed but still somehow fighting for a place in the air, came close enough to them that if the buildings around them had been any taller, it would have knocked their tips off. Its engines lit the scene with a devil’s furnace glow, casting wild shadows in its bright orange light for the moment that it was overhead, before it disappeared over the buildings. They could still hear it after it was out of sight, a creaking and keening sound of its structure fighting the wind and gravity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does your family live in the capital?” Eva asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Kircheis said. “A couple districts away.They’ll be safe. Littenheim doesn’t have enough of an army to occupy much other than this city.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They kept walking. The ship that had flown above them crashed in the distance, though the tearing of metal as it hit the ground was audible from kilometers away. Any screaming that might have accompanied it was swallowed by the distance. Cars around them tried to turn and head the other direction, but none could go anywhere, and one by one they began to open their doors, disgorging panicked pedestrians onto the streets. Kircheis grabbed Eva’s arm, and they picked up the pace, moving quickly enough that Eva didn’t have breath for conversation, or focus for anything other than keeping her feet in front of herself. She had no idea where she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis held her arm gently with his right hand, but produced a gun and held it with his left. Eva almost didn’t notice— he kept his arm at his side— but when they turned a corner she saw him move his arm just enough for it to catch the light, and recognized the gleam of the metal. Was he left handed?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They came to a nondescript looking warehouse in between two different car repair places. It could have belonged to either business, but it seemed to belong to neither. Kircheis looked all around, pulled her through an alley, then opened the back door with a combination on a pad. The door buzzed open, and they entered. It smelled industrial, like old greasy metal, and all the lights were off— only what light came in through the skylights illuminated the scene. There were crates and boxes, all closed, and some vehicles— cars, though some motorbikes, too, and a truck without a trailer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis didn’t relax, even though they had made it to their destination. He led her down a set of stairs into a basement area, which was well lit, and had people in it. There were a few that Evangeline didn’t recognize, all men with the look of soldiers, though none were in uniform. They stood around or sat on the couch against the wall. Only one face was familiar to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Evangeline never thought she would be happy to see Rear Admiral Reuenthal, but she couldn’t deny that the relief she felt was real. He was sitting at a table in the corner, a military radio at his elbow spitting out garbled and incomprehensible updates, while he looked at a paper map of the city. A sheet of plastic was laid on top of it, and he drew lines on that with a marker. He didn’t acknowledge her and Kircheis at all, except to look up at them briefly and then back down at the map.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Make yourself at home,” Kircheis said. “There’s food over there, and the bathrooms, and—” He pointed over to the back corner of the basement, where there were some cots set up. Flimsy privacy curtains stood against the walls, and would need to be moved into place. “These are some of the rest of Duke Braunschweig’s staff who stayed on the planet, and some of Rear Admiral Reuenthal’s men. I’ll introduce you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva nodded mutely and let Kircheis show her around so that she could say hello. Most of the men didn’t care about her one way or the other, and they went back to their own business as soon as she took a seat on one of the cots in the back of the room. She clutched her single bag of possessions to her chest and watched the men as they talked in quiet voices and listened to the radio. Occasionally the ground rumbled as something happened outside, making her flinch each time. Kircheis occasionally glanced over at her with some concern, but she busied herself with looking at her tablet, reading the letter from Wolf over again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Over the course of the evening, the men who had been in the place trickled out, either sent out by Reuenthal or going on their own errands and business. She didn’t know if they’d be back— none of them announced their departure. A silence interrupted only by the radio fell over their little hideout. Kircheis kept trying to make a phone call, but either the reception was too bad in the basement, or the lines were dead. He gave a short explanation that he was going out to see if he could get through, and then left. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was then just Eva and Reuenthal. The space suddenly felt like a set on a stage— it was the lighting that did it, she thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is Fraulein Kohlraush with her family?” Eva asked, breaking the silence. Reuenthal’s marker squeaked across the map in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” he said. “She’s in the same safe house you’re going to, with Countess Leigh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. I didn’t know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal said nothing else, but after a minute got up and poured some coffee from the pot on the counter. He poured two mugs and brought one to her. She had to put down her tablet to take it, and he saw what she was looking at— the long message from Wolf. He couldn’t possibly have read any of the words, standing above her as he was, but he could guess at the sender.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lieutenant Kircheis told me that Mittermeyer is on his way to Iserlohn,” Reuenthal said. “You understood that from whatever letter he sent?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did,” she said. “It was your plan for him to go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal gave a half nod— confirmation, but not asking for too much credit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you write to him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I broke myself of the bad habit of putting important information in my letters years ago,” Reuenthal said. “Anything I wrote would be read far more closely than a letter from his wife.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” she said. “I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words seemed hard for him to get out. “I appreciate your assistance in sending the message.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m—” She wasn’t exactly happy to help send her husband into danger. “He’s glad to have some way to help Hank.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal turned and took a few steps away, though he didn’t leave. He held his coffee with two hands and surveyed the large basement, with its warm yellow light.  “Any of us would be glad for the opportunity to do the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you planning something here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal made a dismissive noise. “Not at the moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were both quiet for a second. Eva looked over at her tablet again, at the stark black and white text of Wolf’s letter. “May I ask you a personal question, Herr Reuenthal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you must.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked down into her cup of coffee. “Has Wolf ever talked to you about children?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Overhead, the roar of some ship flying past. “Once,” Reuenthal said. “When we were students.” His voice was painfully cold— it almost made Eva lose her courage entirely. “You aren’t pregnant, are you? This is a bad time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—” Her voice broke at how desperately she wished she was. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you ask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to pry into— he said in his letter that he needed to talk to me about something when he gets back— and I just wanted to know—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I see what he said?” Reuenthal’s voice was still very cold, but she didn’t see much reason to refuse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here,” she said, and held out the tablet towards him. He turned around to take it, and his face was completely still and expressionless as he read it over. He handed it back to her when he was done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think he wants to talk to you about children? He wants that now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s always wanted to have children with me,” she said. “But I—” Her free hand touched her stomach; Reuenthal watched her dispassionately. When she had gathered herself, she said, “But you know his secret.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal turned away again. “Do you hate me for that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No— of course not. How could I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He laughed. ”It would be very easy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t hate him for having a secret. And I value the friendship that he has with you. I wouldn’t want to…” She trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And will you ask me to tell you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” She wondered if he would— it seemed like he might.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why are you asking me about any of this? What do you think his secret is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought he might have a child somewhere, from before he married me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal laughed— a hard and miserable sound. “No. There’s no child. No other woman.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had been foolish. She had always known that she was, of course. But Reuenthal’s cold voice broke apart the image she had held in her heart for years— the happy, dancing girl with Wolf’s eyes. “Oh,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was that all, Frau Mittermeyer?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you hate me?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were both spared the pain of him answering— Kircheis opened the basement door and came back down. “I let Fraulein Mariendorf know you’re safe,” he said to Eva. “We’ll go to her cousin’s estate in a few days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Lieutenant Kircheis,” Eva said, trying to keep the tears out of her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The little blonde girl still felt real in her dreams.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eva stayed in the underground room for several days. She heard reports come in from the soldiers that snuck in and out, and from what crackly things sounded over the radio. She occasionally looked at the careful map that Reuenthal was keeping of the movements of troops within the city, watching as Littenheim’s forces progressed inexorably towards Neue Sanssouci. She didn’t know how Reuenthal could look at them so dispassionately— every street they passed through seemed to her to be someone’s home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But they were nowhere near this part of the city; Neue Sanssouci was in the other direction completely. No soldiers stomped down their streets, and when Eva emerged to get some air, the sounds of fighting were so far away, only the loudest canon-blasts made it through the air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They waited until it seemed like the majority of the flight out of the city was done, and then Kircheis and Eva took one of the little electric scooters from the upstairs warehouse area, and drove it through the streets. Some of them were blocked with abandoned cars, some with hastily constructed barricades that Eva thought couldn’t stop a tank. Once on the drive, Kircheis made a rare miscalculation, and brought them right up to the side of a downed ship— its center half cratered out, that had crashed through four or five buildings on its way down. It towered above them, like a dead giant, and Eva looked up at it as Kircheis hastily reversed their bike and drove away. The air was heavy with acrid smoke that seemed to come from all directions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The highway, once they had made it out of the city proper, was in no better state. Cars that had been stuck in traffic and then abandoned littered the sides of the highway in droves, and there were places where it seemed like the road had been fired upon by ships passing overhead. Several of the bridges had been destroyed, and to cross to the other side, they had to drive many kilometers north, so far that Eva was surprised that the battery on their scooter took them that far. The roads got clearer and clearer as they went, and Eva was almost ashamed at the relief she felt about that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It turned out that Hildegarde von Mariendorf herself was the one who came to pick Eva up— she had expected it would only be a driver. But it was the cheerful young woman in men’s clothes, whom Eva had met several times in the past, trailing after Hank at some function or another, who waited near a pickup truck in a pulloff on the highway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva sat in the truck’s cab for a while as Hilde and Kircheis had a long conversation. Eva couldn’t really hear it. When Hilde climbed back in and started the truck, she looked out the rearview mirror at Kircheis driving away on the scooter, back the way he had come. Seeing him alone, he looked comically oversized on it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you talking to Lieutenant Kircheis about?” Eva asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, nothing,” Hilde said. She sounded almost embarrassed. “I was just wondering if I could come stay with him in the capital— I hate being out in the country.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to be helpful,” she said. Then she heaved a sigh as she pulled the truck out onto the road. “But Sieg says there’s nothing to do anyway, so I should wait until there is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He seems like a good man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, of course,” Hilde said, seemingly baffled by the comment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a long drive, and they spoke for much of it, even if it wasn’t about anything important. Hilde talked about how, despite the interruption to her studies the civil war represented, she was trying to continue to educate herself about law, and every other subject in the universe, so that she could be helpful to Kaiserin Elizabeth. Eva was quite happy to just listen to Hilde describe the world— she had a matter-of-fact way of putting things that Eva found endearing, and it kept Eva’s mind off of her own life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The countryside estate that they came to was shrouded in snow, and the truck had to struggle up a narrow packed-snow path to get up to the front. It was a beautiful, rich house, and it sparkled in the snow. Although at this point Eva had visited the homes of several noble families, it still seemed strange to think of herself living in such a place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde brought her inside and introduced her to her cousin— a very frail young man who rarely left his bed. The baron seemed tired, so their greetings were quite perfunctory, but there would be plenty of time to get to know each other later. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Eva could be shown her room, a force of nature descended upon her. Magdalena had been waiting outside Baron Kummel’s bedroom, and she pounced on Eva as soon as she stepped back out into the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eva! Darling!” Magdalena cried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde seemed quite used to Maggie’s fits of passion, and scooted out of the way, vanishing down the hallway as Magdalena draped herself across Eva in a hug. She kissed both Eva’s cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi, Maggie,” Eva said. “You seem well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, as well as I can be without you, or even my husband to distract me.” She laughed, and, without taking her hands off Eva, looked her up and down. “Forgive me for being honestly sentimental, but I’m so glad you’re here. I was under the impression that you would go and stay with Wolf’s parents.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I— well— I would rather be here. I wouldn’t get news of how Wolf is doing if I’m not in contact with—” She wiggled her head to encompass this whole circle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And here I thought it might be because you missed me! How silly I am.” But Maggie was smiling, all sins forgiven.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course I missed you,” Eva said. “I don’t know why you left the capital so soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darling, the whole court has moved to the countryside, and I, sadly, am a slave to trends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, let’s sit down. You have to tell me everything that’s been going on. I’m afraid I don’t get as much news out here as I’d like. Nothing gets to me unless it goes through little Hilde, and before that, it has to go through little Siegfried, and before that, who knows where it comes from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Eva said. The torrent of words from Maggie, after so long without being exposed to her vivaciousness, left Eva slightly overwhelmed. Maggie dragged her down the hallway and sat her on a couch in some roomy parlor. The huge windows let in the wan wintery light, though it sparkled off the snow and cheered the scene.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maggie listened with rapt attention to Eva describing her flight from the capital city, and the little basement room where Reuenthal and Kircheis had their headquarters. They sat side by side on the couch, knees together, Eva squinting into the outside light to see Maggie’s face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how is Oskar?” Maggie asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Eva said. “His, er, Fraulein Kohlrausch is here, isn’t she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>here,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Maggie said, somewhat evasively. “She’ll be around. She’s avoiding me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, don’t worry about it,” Maggie said. “Ancient history. We used to be friends, of a sort.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you’re not anymore?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darling, it’s been a long time since I was a </span>
  <em>
    <span>schoolgirl</span>
  </em>
  <span>! Things have changed!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Eva said, though the question didn’t exactly leave her mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And is Neue Sansoucci holding out?” Maggie asked, switching the topic, though Eva thought the edge in her voice was more than just evasiveness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For now,” Eva said. “But Herr Reuenthal said that it was only a matter of time, and that the prime minister is already somewhere else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena’s face twitched, but she covered it up. “Oh, is he? And Erwin Josef?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know— I assume he’d be with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, of course you wouldn’t have any way of knowing.” Magdalena gave her a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you hoping Lichtenlade will win?” Eva asked. “Even though Hank works for Duke Braunschweig?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no, of course not! He’s an odious old man— I’ll be pleased to never see him again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seem upset.” When Maggie’s face lost its composure momentarily, Eva hastily tacked on, “I don’t want to upset you, or pry, or—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you’re not. Darling, when have I ever been anything other than honest with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maggie laughed. “You’re very kind to pretend to have forgotten my scandal,” she said. Almost hesitantly, Maggie reached across their laps and picked up Eva’s hand. Eva let her do it— even though she perhaps shouldn’t. She could continue to pretend that this was just Maggie and her usual exuberance. After all— that was a wedding ring on her finger. “We never did talk about it, you and I, did we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to bring up things that upset you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t upset me.” She pressed Eva’s hand to her chin, not her lips. “Erwin Josef’s mother was my lover— you know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Eva said, somewhat faintly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I still think about her.” She tipped her head, pressing her cheek to Eva’s hand, clasped in her own. Her face was warm and soft. “I’m told she’s safe, on the other side of the galaxy somewhere. That she even knows I still think of her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Eva said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When Hank was on that stupid planet—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Castrop’s planet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Cahokia.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had forgotten about that one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He sent a message to her.” Maggie laughed a little. “One of the soldiers there passed it along— he told me the story of how that all happened, but I’ve forgotten it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva nodded, and Maggie was silent for a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ingrid— I wish I could do something for her son,” Maggie said. “That’s all. He’s probably—” She couldn’t bring herself to say that he was going to die; Eva could hear it in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, that’s the court, darling,” Maggie said. She abruptly released Eva’s hand and sat up straight. “But there’s nothing I can do.” Maggie craned her neck behind herself to look out the window. Her hands played with the fabric of her skirt, twisting it up. Eva looked at her and felt a rush of warmth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tentatively, she put her hand on Maggie’s. “It’s kind of you,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is?” Maggie asked. Her voice was strained, and she didn’t look away from the window.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To feel compassion for another woman’s son,” she said.</span>

  <em>
    <span>December 488 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer’s outpost, a shipbuilding facility, was in a starsystem that even the most astute students of Imperial geography probably couldn’t pinpoint on a map. Though the system was on a major trading route within the Empire, it was barely populated— fewer than fifty thousand people lived in the bases scattered throughout the system, and more than ten thousand of those were under Mittermeyer’s command. Once, this star had supported rocky, terrestrial planets— some of which might have even been suitable for life— but the actions of some rogue object flying through the system had torn them apart eons ago. At least, that was what Mittermeyer had been told about the scattered asteroid field that surrounded the star, which was picked through for bountiful exposed ore of many different varieties. The bulk of the mining was done with great machines of Phezzani design. Mittermeyer could sometimes see them, on the scopes, departing or returning to the processing bases off in the distance. His outpost had little to do with that industry, aside from making use of the refined metals produced.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Mittermeyer had cared at all about engineering, he might have been proud to be in charge of his docks. While this was not the largest shipbuilding port in the Empire (it was the fourth largest), it was by far the most technically advanced, and was focused on producing the first round of ships for each class, and some ships that would be the sole members of their class. The vessels that left here were the finest that the Empire could produce.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The docks stretched out in great spokes from a central asteroid, and each line of ships went so far that the individual details of the vessels were indistinguishable. The facility could comfortably berth about two thousand ships— an entire small fleet, if it was needed to bring that many in for a complete overhaul— but right now the docks held about three quarters of that. Of those, five hundred were ships already in service that were undergoing minor refit work— paused due to the civil war. The remaining thousand were new construction in varying stages. Perhaps a quarter of those were completely finished and either undergoing testing or ready to be shipped out— delivery was another thing that had been paused. The rest were still fully under construction, and ranged from being nothing but the empty skeletal frames of the ships, to having their internal wiring and computers installed, to simply waiting on furniture to be delivered. Most of the work had ground to a standstill since the Kaiser’s death— Mittermeyer kept the production running as long as he could, but there was a limit to what could be accomplished without a constant delivery of material. So the majority of the ships sat quiescent in the docks, waiting out the end of the civil war.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The proudest pair of these ships were the new experimental designs, still nameless, which were fully operational, and— before the outbreak of madness— had been sitting in port as beautiful showpieces, waiting for a chance to demonstrate their operational capacities to the fleet admirals and the Kaiser, so that entire production runs of their classes could be started up. As display pieces, they were painted extraordinary colors, and if it weren’t for their visible gunports, they could be mistaken for a noble’s oversized pleasure vessels to an untrained eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Mittermeyer would have said he had no interest in the workings of these ships, and (before the civil war) would sigh heavily at the technical and administrative work it would take to transition these experimental builds into a program of record, he couldn’t deny that the pair of ships was a sight to behold. They sat next to each other in the very first docking spaces outside the station, so that they could be seen from the observational windows. They glowed under the station’s lights. When he had arrived to take command of the base, the first had already been painted a gleaming white, but he had been given a chance to pick the color of the second. He was tempted to pair white with black, but since these were meant to be seen against the darkness of space, he chose an incredible crimson.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although the colors of the ships gave them an air of excitement that the standard classes of battleships in the Imperial fleet lacked, even if they had been the same gunmetal grey as all the rest, they still would have appeared sleek and new. Spacefaring vessels had little need for aerodynamics, but still the hulls of these two ships curved gracefully, like ancient boats, or the wings of birds. The two ships were, quite possibly, the fastest ships in the Imperial fleet— though the red one was faster by a fraction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer leaned against the railing of the observation deck, looked past his reflection in the huge windows, and thought about how he was about to steal them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The trouble was this: Mittermeyer needed to urgently get to the other side of Iserlohn Fortress.His wife had told him this in code in her most recent letter— it spoke plainly about the last time he had been in battle, and where he had met Yang after that. Reuenthal or Lieutenant Kircheis must have told her what to write.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Receiving that letter from his wife, even if she hadn’t known exactly what she had been talking about, stirred up a terrible feeling of guilt. His reunion with Yang, and later Reuenthal, at Cahokia and Iserlohn had been a blissful dream for Mittermeyer. One in which he had kept his wife firmly from his mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The anticipation of going to help Yang now had somehow broken through Mittermeyer’s malaise of indecision. He penned a reply letter to Eva without stopping to think about what he was writing in it. He made two promises: to help Yang, and to tell her the truth. Saying that he would do something led him to believe that it was all possible, that he would do it, no matter what it took.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, it was an insane proposition to get to the other side of Iserlohn. The rebels, with thousands and thousands of ships, had never managed it, no matter how many times they tried. And while Mittermeyer might have a tiny fleet’s worth of ships, he did not have loyal crew to run them. He was sure that he had been given this position solely because Fleet Admiral Muckenburger considered it harmless— even if every man on the base was loyal to him, he  wouldn’t have crew enough to staff the empty ships in port.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The subordinates he trusted had already gone throughout the base and selected people who might be suitable crews. He had been assured that they could staff two ships, at least— though they would be as understaffed as a ship could get. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No one was going to stop Mittermeyer from leaving— while most of the crew of the station weren’t loyal to him personally, he doubted that any of them cared enough about the outcome of the civil war to stage any kind of real resistance. Even still, Mittermeyer’s plans had the pretext of taking the two ships out for routine testing. Since construction had been paused on most things, testing had become the only work of the day for weeks. Most people in the station knew it was approaching make-work, but they didn’t complain much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lights flickered in the little docking tunnels that connected the two ships to the station: people loading supplies. This wasn’t even covert.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer wasn’t taking much with him. The clothes on his back, and anything he could carry in a day bag was all. He checked the time again. They would leave in less than five hours.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The only decision that remained to be made was a simple one: which ship would he travel on? The red ship was faster, but the white ship was better armored. He gravitated towards the faster ship, but after thinking it over, he rejected it. He was moving on Yang’s plan, and Yang would tell him to take the safer ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could picture exactly what Yang would say: “The thing about relying on speed is that if you slow down for even a second, you’ve lost your advantage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I won’t slow down,” he might say as a rejoinder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Yang would sigh and look at him with concern— and so Mittermeyer chose the white ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stood at the window and looked at the pair for a while more— it was the last he would see of the outside of the white one until he was back in port— and then straightened his back and marched away.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Since Mittermeyer thought that there was absolutely no chance of getting through the Iserlohn corridor alive, this left only one route as an option. Phezzan, and sneaking around through the Alliance the long way, would have to do. Although there were many problems with this plan, as they grew closer to the entrance to the Phezzan corridor, the most pressing of them was that they did not have navigation information to get through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phezzan made all ships passing through the corridor pay to receive up-to-date routes, and even if the Imperial government had some way of obtaining these, it was a secret that was not casually shared with the guidance computers of Mittermeyer’s stolen ships.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kept turning the question over in his head on their journey. Ideally, he would contact Yang’s spy on Phezzan, and hope that he would be able to provide a route to Mittermeyer without being detected by the Alliance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If the whole plan had been thought out ahead of time, this might have worked. If Yang had been the one coordinating it, if he had left real instructions with his spy, and a secret way that they could communicate. But he hadn’t. There was no way for Mittermeyer to contact the spy alone, no way to know that the spy was actually loyal, and no way to keep their communications secret. So, even if that was the option he would have preferred in a perfect universe, he rejected it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That left a waiting game. Merchant ships contacted Phezzan and received their routes. If Mittermeyer lay in wait for a merchant ship, or a ship full of refugees headed for Phezzan (and eventually the Alliance), he could then either capture and board the ship, and use it to travel freely through the corridor, or he would follow it in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since this was the only real option, when they reached the mouth of the Phezzan corridor, they stationed themselves outside of it, and waited. They swept the area with their active radar, hoping to catch any unlucky vessel that might stray into their net. But although they sat there for nearly a week none came.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps it was just bad luck, or bad timing. As the civil war dragged on, merchant traffic through the corridor probably had grown less and less frequent. Who knew how long he might have to wait for a ship to wander through. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And a grim thought crossed Mittermeyer’s mind as he grew more and more impatient: there was no guarantee that he would even </span>
  <em>
    <span>see</span>
  </em>
  <span> any ship that passed. Military hardware, especially that on his advanced ships, was very good, but detecting a single ship in space, unless it was broadcasting wildly (which no sane ship would be doing now), was like finding a needle in a haystack. The idea that he had been sitting and letting time and opportunity slip through his fingers made him anxious and jumpy. He wanted to get moving, and he went over his options again and again, trying to find some way to get through the corridor unnoticed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he could see it, there was only one thing that remained for him to do. He didn’t like it, though it felt like what Yang would do, which made Mittermeyer linger over it, and come back to it— and even think about it in the first place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer had brought two ships with him— two of the finest ships in the Imperial fleet. Even one of them would be a prize, something that a defector might be quite happy to steal to turn over to the Alliance, in exchange for safety, or a position, or any kind of reward on the opposite side of the galaxy. It was the kind of defection that a low-ranked officer might try, in an attempt to get ahead in life— even if it was ahead in a foreign country. If Mittermeyer had the crew of the red ship pretend to defect, send a message to Phezzan asking for a route through to the Alliance, they would surely say yes to that. It was their policy, to let people through. And in a time of turmoil in the Empire, they were hardly likely to think that it was a trap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, one ship would go ahead, follow the given route through the corridor, and be met with some Alliance ships waiting to pick them up. The other ship would follow at a safe distance, using the same route, and would therefore be able to safely sneak into Alliance territory unnoticed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer brought the captain of the red ship over and discussed the plan with him. Captain Cauer was an older man and, like Mittermeyer, trained as an engineer. He had been working in the shipyards his entire career, and, unlike Mittermeyer, loved it. Mittermeyer had asked him to come in the first place because he knew the two experimental ships better than most others— he had been intimately involved in their construction and testing. It didn’t hurt that they had gotten along well, though Mittermeyer suspected that half the reason Cauer had agreed to come was to make sure nothing happened to his precious ships.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He saluted Mittermeyer when he came in, then went pale as a sheet when Mittermeyer described what he wanted him to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Give her up to the rebels?” he asked. “They’ll take her apart, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you judge it’s safe, you can make a break for it, back through the corridor. You’re fast enough that I don’t think they’d be able to catch you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If they even send three ships to pick us up, they’d be able to shoot us down before we got out of range. There’s only so much concentrated fire the shields can take. I don’t think it’s feasible to say we’ll be able to run away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if you do see the chance, please take it. I’m not exactly thrilled to be delivering the rebels the best we have. But I don’t have much other choice. We can’t keep waiting around here— I need to get to the other side of Iserlohn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think you can do this, Captain Cauer?” Mittermeyer asked. He leaned forward, elbows on his desk, and stared at the man’s watery blue eyes. “You can refuse— I can send someone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll do it, sir,” he said, though it was with an air of resignation. “I should scuttle her, once you’re through.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No point in that,” Mittermeyer said. “It would be a shame to destroy a ship like that. If you can’t get away— take the rewards the rebels give you. When all this is over, come back through Phezzan. I’ll vouch for you, and any of your men.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You presume a lot, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That I’ll be alive, after all of this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never been in real battle, sir— I’ve been very lucky working where I have. I don’t know if I could believe that I’ll come out of anything safely. At least not enough to make promises that I intend to keep.” Unspoken was the shared knowledge that no one had fought Iserlohn Fortress and won yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope my intent to keep it is enough for you,” Mittermeyer said. “It’s unfortunately all I have to give.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer nodded. “I’m sorry to have taken you from a post you enjoy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Most people do not have the luxury of choosing their posts.” He smiled for the first time. “You didn’t— I should point out that you’re glad to be out in the universe, instead of safe at a desk job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer smiled ruefully. “I hoped it wasn’t so obvious.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid you are a fairly direct man, sir. It’s not a bad thing, but it’s not hard to see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take your word for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I request that you try not to destroy this ship too, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer laughed. “I’ll certainly do my best.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Out of curiosity— if you do win, what will you do with her?” Cauer asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well—” Mittermeyer hadn’t thought that far in the future. “If we win, it might be nice for the Kaiserin to reward the conqueror of Iserlohn with a flagship. Commodore von Leigh— the one who wrote this plan— has never had a ship of his own.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t try to keep her, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no,” Mittermeyer said. “I don’t think I’d like a flagship that stands out too much. And besides, Duke Braunschweig personally dislikes me— there wouldn’t be any hope of me getting her, even if I begged, which I have no interest in doing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why in Odin’s name are you working for him then, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I— well— it’s a long story, Captain. I’m not really doing it for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see I’m not making a very compelling case for why you should give your life’s work over to the rebels for me,” Mittermeyer said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I understand,” Cauer replied. “I’ll do it. At the very least, it means that one of the two won’t be shot down, by the Thor Hammer or anything else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer and the crew of the white ship waited outside the Phezzan corridor, waiting for the red ship to pass through. Once the route had been transmitted from Phezzan to the red ship, and from there to Mittermeyer, it was a matter of patience. It was not a short journey from one end of the corridor to the other, and Mittermeyer wanted to be very sure that by the time he passed through, all the rebel ships on the other end were long gone. Of course, once the red ship left, there was no communication between them, so Mittermeyer had to hope that they made it safely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After several days of waiting, they set off. The only difficulty with the route was that it took them very close to Phezzan itself, and Mittermeyer did not want to be detected passing through the starsystem. In the hopes of avoiding being seen, before they entered the starsystem, they dropped to sub-luminal speeds. Then Mittermeyer ordered the ship to accelerate, still sub-light, until they were going as fast as the ship could take. Once at that speed, he ordered power to be cut to the engines, and they drifted through the Phezzani system, hoping that their cool, unused engines would not make them show up on even advanced detectors within the system, and if they did, to look like a passing piece of rock. It was a risky maneuver, but the only one that they had at their disposal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was a long and tense trip— it took days of sub-light travel to get out of the system, and the crew’s eyes were fixed on their instruments the whole time, straining to see if they were being lit up by some Phezzani radar, searching them out. Mittermeyer hardly slept, hardly left his command chair. He would only leave the bridge when he felt his eyes slipping involuntarily shut, and he would go spent some fraction of an hour in a tank bed, just until he was awake enough to resume his watch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least it was an interesting trip through Phezzan’s starsystem. The planet was constantly broadcasting radio signals of all types out into space. Since Mittermeyer was traveling below light speed, they could pick all this up. Most of it was boring traffic chatter, but a lot of it was news, and Mittermeyer listened during his every waking second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phezzan’s economy seemed to be in dire straits from the Empire’s civil war. This shouldn’t have been surprising, considering how they hadn’t seen a single ship pass between Phezzan and the Empire while they were waiting, when in normal times Mittermeyer supposed there were maybe hundreds of ships a day that made the trip. Much of the chatter was in the Alliance language, and Mittermeyer found one of his crew who had studied the tongue enough to tell him what they were talking about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed that if Phezzan’s economy quivered, the Alliance’s came down like a house of cards. The Alliance merchants coming into the system to do business with Phezzan were complaining to each other about the shockwaves that were tearing their businesses apart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was strange to think that the Alliance was somehow intimately tied to the Empire, since it proclaimed its independence as much as at could. It was funny to think that, although the Empire was certainly suffering during the civil war, all its feudal lands, operating independently and with only a tenuous connection to the galactic economy, were continuing life much as they had been before. The Alliance, all its planets deeply tied in with Phezzani accounting, was in a much worse shape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phezzan was the bridge between them— and it certainly benefited Phezzan to be that way. He almost wondered if Phezzan was putting the Alliance at a disadvantage deliberately, to stop them from being able to bring all their resources to bear against Iserlohn Fortress while the Empire was weak. After all, if the Alliance was able to take advantage of this situation, Phezzan would lose its role in the galaxy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer had never known much about the way that trade flowed through the galaxy, and less about the Alliance’s mysterious economy, but he was fascinated to listen to the chatter. It kept the many hours he stayed awake on the bridge interesting. Listening to this news absorbed all of his attention, and most of his restless energy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew this wasn’t the way he should be operating— he should be saving his energy for everything ahead— but he couldn’t tear himself away. The strangeness of the trip invigorated him, and knowing what lay ahead even more so. The idea of fighting side by side with Yang, for the first time, made him twitchy with anticipation. If anyone else had been the one to claim they would conquer Iserlohn, Mittermeyer would have laughed at them, but he had complete trust in Yang— and was anxious to contribute to the victory. It was dangerous to think of victory before he had even arrived at the battlefield, but it was all Mittermeyer could think about</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once out of Phezzan’s starsystem itself, the journey became more perilous. Alliance military ships would not be allowed within the Phezzan corridor, so the exit to the corridor was the first place that they could expect to meet resistance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both ends of the corridor had wide mouths, openings light-minutes wide, that made it theoretically possible for a ship to sneak through without being detected. But, of course, the Alliance did not want traffic passing into their borders that they couldn’t control or didn’t know about— Phezzanis were one thing, smugglers were another— so there were detection arrays stationed throughout the wide mouth, and surely ships that were stationed not far away, that would stay around to respond to any intrusion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer consulted with his crew to see if there was a chance that they could use the same trick they had flown through the Phezzani system with. The answer was no, or at least it seemed too dangerous to attempt. A starsystem like Phezzan had an abundance of natural debris that was tossed around by the star’s gravity, making a chunk of rock about the size of a Mittermeyer’s ship not an unusual thing to detect. Additionally, although Phezzani technology was very good, they had no standing space fleet that they could send out against any ships they detected— it was forbidden by their Imperial charter. So there was less incentive for them to monitor every inch of space. The Alliance, on the other hand, had a detection net that they put to good use. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed likely that they would be caught, passing through. So the only thing that they could do was to try to direct attention away from themselves. As part of the supplies that Mittermeyer had ordered loaded onto the white ship, he had taken the entire base’s store of decoys— both those that had still been stocked on ships that were in base for repair, and those that were used for testing targeting systems on their new built ships. It seemed like they might come in handy, since a single ship traveling alone might want to appear less solitary.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer ordered the decoys to be sent out of the mouth of the corridor with them. It was a false trail of several hundred ghost ships, each spewing in a different direction into the Alliance. The white ship slipped among them, heading on its own course.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was obvious to anyone looking that the decoys were decoys— they couldn’t move except in a straight line, and could not go to super-luminal speeds. But even so, with one ship among hundreds of ghosts, pretending to be one of them, Mittermeyer hoped that it would take some time for the Alliance to realize exactly which ship was his. Some of the decoys could obviously be disregarded— those that shot off in meaningless directions— and Mittermeyer tried to make it look like his ship was among their number, not heading into the Alliance at all, simply skirting along the edge of navigable territory towards the Iserlohn corridor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even with all this deception, Mittermeyer knew they would be found. The only question was when.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take long, three days, until their instruments picked up the telltale sign of ships approaching. As soon as they knew that the Alliance was on their tail, Mittermeyer abandoned all subtlety, and instead pushed the ship as fast as it could go. They had a headstart on the trailing Alliance ships, though it was a narrow one. Mittermeyer wished that he was in the red ship instead of the white one, so that they could increase their lead as much as possible, but there was no sense in wasting time on wishing. He just insisted that the white ship be sent to its absolute limit, straining the engines, using any amount of fuel and not caring about saving it in the least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They ran through the edge of the galaxy’s arm, at every moment wondering when they would encounter ships ahead of them, as well as those chasing behind. The Iserlohn corridor was always full of Alliance ships— Mittermeyer knew that very well from his time on patrol. He could use that to his advantage, too. He knew their usual routes fairly well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since it was no longer a game of being undetected, Mittermeyer ran the white ship directly into one of these well traveled routes, joining one of the lanes where the Alliance usually approached Iserlohn, rather than their tracks returning to their own territory. It was a risk— he didn’t want to run headfirst into an Alliance patrol, but he did want to bait one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After all, now that he was on this side of Iserlohn, he had no way of coordinating with Yang on the other end. He needed some way to signal to Yang that he could proceed with his plan. Getting Iserlohn Fortress to send out their fleet to counteract Alliance activity in the corridor would be about the best signal Mittermeyer could engineer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they raced through the corridor, the number of ships behind them swelled. Although the operator manning the detection system was panicked when he gave his news, Mittermeyer was glad. A whole patrol fleet behind them was significantly better than one ahead of them— it was exactly what he had hoped to achieve. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they grew closer to Iserlohn, he still had a little bit of a lead on the Alliance ships, at least enough of one that he could cash it out in one last move. Mittermeyer redirected his ship off to the side of the corridor, then turned off his engines. Dropping out of faster-than-light travel killed his momentum entirely. He was dead in space, not moving at all. Although it was almost suicidal, losing his positional advantage like that, he needed to in order to contact the fortress. He couldn’t signal them when moving faster than light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sent out a distress call, on the same frequencies that he had used when he had been patrolling the corridor. He spoofed his own ship’s identification, using the callsign of a ship that had formerly been in his own patrol fleet, and was still attached to Iserlohn somewhere. There was a greater than even chance that that ship, and whatever fleet it was in now, was out on patrol elsewhere in the corridor. Iserlohn’s security when it came to checking the actual identification of ships’ messages tended to be far too lax— he doubted anyone would notice the signal was falsified. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His false distress message to the fortress indicated that the patrol had run into a full rebel invasion fleet, and had been nearly wiped out, except for his ship, running back towards the fortress to warn them. Mittermeyer ended the message with a last cry for help, then sent out a single remaining decoy ahead of himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hoped that the Alliance ships behind him would continue to chase the single decoy, which looked like it stayed moving sub-light in order to receive messages from Iserlohn itself. His message to the fortress had at least been encrypted so that the Alliance ships couldn’t understand it, and they probably thought he was communicating with Iserlohn about whatever his “real” business in the corridor was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hoped that his ship, completely dead in space, not moving, not broadcasting, would be invisible. The singular decoy swapped out for his own ship was a good trick— the Alliance fleet passed by Mittermeyer without noticing him at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as they had passed, Mittermeyer engaged his engines again. They were right near the splitting point, where the main trunk of the Iserlohn corridor diverged. One slender arm reached back, in the direction of the Alliance, towards Cahokia. Mittermeyer ran there, as fast as he could go. There would be a fleet waiting for him to take command in that starsystem, while behind him, Iserlohn Fortress sent out her fleet to deal with an Alliance invasion.</span>

  <em>
    <span>January 489 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The journey to Iserlohn Fortress was one fraught with tension for several reasons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang warned Braunschweig that Fleet Admiral Muckenburger knew that they were coming, so it would not be out of the question for him to send out the Iserlohn Fortress fleet in advance, to stop Braunschweig’s fleet before they even arrived in the corridor. Waiting to encounter an enemy ahead was never a pleasant feeling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was made worse by not knowing the status of events on Odin. If Littenheim had, by occupying the capital, gotten Lichtenlade to surrender, there would be other Imperial fleets chasing them from behind, too. Hunting them down on Littenheim’s orders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had only been the fact that Braunschweig had no ground troops in his current fleet— nothing he could use to mount any attack on an enemy on the ground— that had stopped him from chasing Littenheim all the way down to Odin. Braunschweig’s fleet needed to reunite with their own ground troops, many of whom were stationed on Cahokia, on the other side of the corridor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even if they didn’t encounter enemies en route, what lay ahead was not really pleasant to contemplate. Despite the confidence Braunschweig projected to his men, and their past successes with Geiersburg, everyone in the fleet had spent their entire career thinking of Iserlohn Fortress as an impenetrable wall. For some, the idea of being the ones to finally break it was exhilarating— but for others, the idea of losing their lives under the Thor Hammer filled them with despair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang felt reasonably confident that he could take the fortress if all went to plan, but it seemed unlikely that everything would.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But even if he was having doubts about their ability to carry out the attack, it wasn’t a plan that could be changed, since they had no way of contacting their forces on Cahokia. So Yang tried not to think about it during the trip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unlike their time in the minefield, where he had spent as much of his waking hours as possible on the bridge, Yang tried to make himself invisible. Although he got the sense that Braunschweig’s men knew, in an abstract sense, that he had been the one to formulate the plan of attack, he wasn’t a confidence-inspiring figure, nor did he want to be one. Let Braunschweig take the initiative to talk about their assured success.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He slunk through the Berlin at odd hours, and no one seemed to miss him much. No one aside from Ansbach, who hunted him down one night while he was eating alone— a cold leftover dinner— in the officers’ mess. Yang was the only one in the room, a sole figure in the sea of clean white tablecloths with no place settings on them. He had his plate shoved idly to the side, and he picked at the wilted salad with his fork while he scrolled through his tablet with his left hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked up when the door opened, then looked back down at his dinner when Ansbach came in. Ansbach disappeared into the industrial kitchen without even saying hello, emerged a minute later with a hot mug of coffee, and sat down across from Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked at Yang’s tablet. It was displaying text in the Alliance language— Yang was reading sections of Reinhard von Musel’s economics newsletter, the one that Muller had sent him. It was the distraction that Yang needed, being quite removed from his own current troubles. He had never gone back all the way to the beginning of Musel’s archive, and it was amusing to picture a boy hardly older than the one in Kircheis’s photo writing these treatises.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach skimmed the text with a displeased twitch of his lips. Yang assumed he couldn’t read it at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you reading?” Ansbach asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An essay on the effects of Phezzan’s financial-responsibility inheritance law on the structure of Alliance firms that do business in that territory,” Yang replied. He turned off the tablet and looked up at Ansbach. “But I assume that’s not what you’re here to talk to me about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Alliance?” he asked, stressing the foreign word, though Yang had delivered it in an accented enough Imperial tone that it fit naturally into his sentence. “It’s a close enough topic, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang said nothing, but gave Ansbach a questioning look as he drank his tea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m here to warn you about what’s going to happen after we take Iserlohn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Warn me? I was the one who wrote the plan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach didn’t appreciate Yang’s tone. His expression remained stony. “You may think that certain people are stupid, but that won’t save you from their paranoia.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And who among the illustrious Braunschweig clan are you accusing of stupidity, Ansbach?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not in the mood, Leigh. You know what I’m talking about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid that I don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll put it bluntly, then: your plan to turn Iserlohn Fortress over to the rebels.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang laughed. “You think I’ve been planning this since I was sixteen? You must think a lot more highly of me than I do of myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach frowned, and drank his coffee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t really think I’m about to do that,” Yang said. “You would have gotten rid of me a long time ago if you did. I don’t doubt you’re capable.” Ansbach was harmless now— Yang couldn’t help but twitch his lips in an almost-smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t tell me it’s not a little in the back of your mind. You’ve put yourself in the perfect position for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Reuenthal tells me that I’ve put myself in the perfect position to kill everyone here and crown myself Kaiser. Everyone who wants me to be a traitor is going to have to get in line.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang had bet that honesty would startle Ansbach enough to disarm him, and he was right. He opened his mouth like a fish for a moment, then closed it again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s right,” Ansbach said after a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The last thing I want is to be the Kaiser. Besides— you’re in just as good of a position as I am. I could accuse you of scheming, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Ansbach bark out a laugh. “No, I’m not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But would that really matter to Baron Flegel, the paranoiac you’ve come to warn me about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not planning to turn Iserlohn over to the rebels, if you need me to reassure you,” Yang said with some finality. “I don’t even want to use our last resort, of asking them to back us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not? You’re a republican, aren’t you? Wouldn’t it get what you want?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who did you hear that from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Princess Amarie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I am guilty of that,” Yang said. “But I’m other things, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like a count? Has owning property gone to your head at last?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On another day, Ansbach’s tone would have been far more cutting. Despite the harshness of his initial overtures, Ansbach had come to mildly antagonize Yang because he was as apprehensive about the invasion of Iserlohn as anyone else, rather than any malice or forethought. Yang was possibly the only person on board that Ansbach could talk to with any degree of freedom, and with whom the subject could be something other than the fast-approaching battle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “I don’t believe so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what is the other thing that’s turned you away from republican ideals? Being a married man?” He looked pointedly at Yang’s wedding ring.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t turned away,” Yang said. He leaned back in his seat, looked over Ansbach’s shoulder at the Braunschweig crest on the wall of the mess. “I trust you won’t go around telling everyone that I hope that this nation can become a democracy someday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyone who looks at you is already sure you think that— or whatever they think about the rebels and their politics.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe so,” Yang said. “Anyway, it is my hope, but I don’t think being invaded by the rebels is the best way to achieve it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No? It’s probably the fastest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it?” Yang shook his head. “Even if on paper every planet they conquered was given equal rights immediately, if everyone was made a citizen right then and there, I would think it would take quite some time— a hundred years, maybe— for that to actually be represented in their government. And in the meantime, every planet is a conquered territory, with all that entails.” He smiled, that wry, half-secretive but genuine smile. “If the Empire can come to democracy on her own terms, that would be better for everyone. I keep saying that I’m a servant to all the Empire’s people. It’s a shame that no one has ever once believed me, even if it’s the complete truth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you’re capable of telling the truth,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t we having a truthful conversation right now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want to happen, once we get Iserlohn?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know. If we can, make the government surrender. If not—” He let out a breath. “It was what I initially proposed to Braunschweig when he took me on, but that was a different time— like I said, I won’t suggest we make overtures to the rebels right away. First, we should try Odin for ourselves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you understand that making that suggestion would be suicide.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone might still need to, if we end up on the back foot with Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Lichtenlade surrenders to Littenheim, you mean.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang nodded. “We can’t fight the entire Imperial government, and Braunschweig certainly won’t give up. But I hope that doesn’t happen— this war is already terrible. Inviting the rebels in would make it cost...” He trailed off. Millions more lives— soldiers on both sides, and civilians throughout the Empire.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is your calculus really just to minimize death?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What other calculus is there?” Yang shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Don’t tell me. I know there are others.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach didn’t press— strange. “I seem to remember that was a class you failed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Almost failed,” Yang said. “I’ve always just squeaked by.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how you manage it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Yang said. “It would almost be easier if I had failed, really failed, somewhere along the way. I wouldn’t have to worry about it anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’d be dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged, though his eyes skirted away from Ansbach’s gaze— he knew that better than most others. “Yeah, probably.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that what keeps you from failing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang tried to smile, but it was maybe more of a grimace. “What do you think?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach shook his head, drained his coffee, then stood. When he was putting his empty mug on the cart of dirty dishes in the corner, he spoke. “I believe you, unfortunately.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Believe me about what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who you’re working for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So don’t die,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach’s unintentional echoing of Oberstein’s sentiments made Yang uncomfortable. He tried to joke: “I didn’t know I could convince you to be a republican.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t, My Lord,” Ansbach said with a scowl, which made Yang shake his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>As they came closer to the Iserlohn corridor, the discussion about how they were going to begin the attack grew more and more serious. In order to signal to their other forces on Cahokia that they were ready to begin the two pronged battle, Yang’s forces would have to attack Iserlohn first, in a dramatic enough way to force them to send out their fleet, or use the Thor Hammer. Either of those two things would be visible to the watchers near Cahokia.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was, of course, the chance that the outpost on Cahokia had already been destroyed. Muckenburger knew it was there, and knew what Yang planned to use it for. Yang had made a bet that Muckenburger also had no desire to waste lives, or make himself an enemy of Braunschweig when he didn’t need to— he would wait until they attacked Iserlohn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a bet that relied on Muckenburger’s pride, as well. He had to believe that he could defend the fortress as it was, without a preemptive strike. That seemed to Yang like the type of man he was, but this civil war was so different from fighting the Alliance— the only kind of battle Muckenburger had lived for— that it was hard to know for sure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s plan was to bombard Iserlohn from just outside the range of the Thor Hammer. They would send in missiles, hoping to disrupt the liquid metal shell of the fortress. The fortress’ floating gun turrets would be able to take care of it, at least initially— this was one of the lessons that Yang knew the fortress had learned after Admiral Sitolet in the Alliance had attacked— but the turrets could still be overwhelmed. Muckenburger would be forced to launch his fleet, and do it early, to stop them from becoming trapped beneath the liquid metal shell. If that was too disrupted, it would make it very difficult for the fleet to launch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since missiles were a finite resource, and Muckenburger could try to wait out the attack and hope that Yang ran out before Iserlohn was too damaged, Yang had stressed to Braunschweig that they should take as many missiles as they could physically load into their ships. They had, and in the belly of each vessel were hundreds of powerful bombs. Most were conventional high explosives, but they also brought the Braunschweig family’s personal cache of atomics. Yang hoped that those would not be necessary.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the mouth of the corridor, they reduced their speed, hoping to avoid detection. If the Iserlohn fleet had not yet launched to meet them, which it seemed like they hadn’t, they wanted to remain undetected as long as possible, which meant slowing down to take a circuitous route through the corridor, avoiding the observation stations and communications outposts that littered the space.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It felt strangely easy, going up against the Imperial government, since they had maps of where everything in the corridor was. Muckenburger could have stationed additional watchers, but they didn’t meet any en route.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was asleep, dozing off in a chair in the officer’s lounge with a book forgotten across his knees, when he was shaken awake by an urgent hand. He pried his eyes open and found himself staring into Hans von Vering’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was told to get you,” Vering said, adopting an air of indifference as soon as Yang was conscious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who?” Yang mumbled, trying to regain his senses. They weren’t anywhere near Iserlohn proper yet, so he hadn’t been expecting a summons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Commodore Ansbach.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there trouble?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering narrowed his eyes and said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There had to be trouble. There were no alarms sounding, so they couldn’t be in battle, but anything Ansbach needed Yang for couldn’t be good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang hauled himself out of his plush armchair with regret, and followed shufflingly after Vering.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the middle of the night, and though the bridge was fully occupied— this was war, no skeleton crew would suffice— it was eerily quiet, with just the soft beeping of computers and the sounds of men breathing in the dimness. The overhead display showed the field of stars outside, making it feel like Yang was walking through some metal-floored plain on an empty planet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach sat in the central chair, but he stood up as soon as Yang came in. Ansbach seemed to never really sleep, these days. He took an hour in the tank bed once every shift, and called that good enough. These short rests were not enough to clear up the sallow look of his face, or the dark shadows of his eyes. Without speaking, he passed Yang a tablet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The tablet displayed a readout from the communications station, which was monitoring for any broadcasts within the corridor. Thus far through their trip, things had been unnaturally silent— no communications between Iserlohn and Odin, or any chatter between the fortress and her fleet that might be on the Empire side of the corridor. But now, it seemed like they had picked up a message, coming from behind them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a wide broadcast— and short, because of that— it repeated over and over as it swept across space, tossed into the wind. To do so, it was using a ship’s highest power transmitters— the ones used for emergency distress calls. The message wasn’t even long enough to be tagged with any identifying information: it was simply one word. It was a miracle that they had even picked up the signal at all, since it was coming from very far away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All it said was WAIT.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this for us?” Ansbach asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked at the crisp black text on the screen for a long minute, as though the four characters there could reveal some additional meaning. “Who else would it be for?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. Someone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not for the fortress— if someone were transmitting to them, its location is known, so they’d be able to speak to them directly. I don’t know who else would be in the corridor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you’re not about to suggest we reply to find out,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not.” He handed back the tablet, then ran his hand through his hair. “But we should obey.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering, who had been listening from a couple feet away, and was peering at the tablet in Ansbach’s hand, looked up, startled. “What? Weren’t you the one who was paranoid about traps before?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Yang said. “I don’t think this is one, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know?” Ansbach asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a gut feeling, more than anything else, but he couldn’t say that. He closed his eyes and tipped his face towards the sky-ceiling above, feeling the stretch in his throat as he spoke. “I thought something like this would happen,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what is ‘this’?” Vering asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Reinforcements,” Yang said. “Coming through Phezzan, heading towards Cahokia.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re summoning ships out of thin air, now?” Vering asked. Ansbach gave him a glare, and he shut up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I know who it is, and how it happened.” Yang couldn’t keep the strain out of his voice— the mixing of relief that he would have an ally, and fear. There was a reason he had intentionally avoided asking his friends for help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who?” Ansbach asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mittermeyer,” Yang said. Ansbach nodded, without comment, which surprised Yang. He continued. “This wouldn’t be happening unless the situation on Odin is desperate. We need to take Iserlohn quickly, in that case. We can’t let this turn into a siege.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wasn’t that the plan?” Ansbach asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang took the tablet back, looked at the singular, enigmatic message again. “It was, but it’s not anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If time is of the essence, how long are we supposed to wait?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Until we get another signal,” Yang said. “I’m sure we’ll see it soon enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And until then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We wait,” Yang said. “We hide in the corridor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You explain this to Admiral Merkatz,” Ansbach said. “If he takes your word for it, then I’ll present it to the duke.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Yang said. He could already see exactly what was happening— Mittermeyer’s fleet of ships racing across space. He could paint that picture for Merkatz.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lieutenant Commander Vering—” Ansbach said, clearing his expression to something totally blank. “You— you know how navigation charts work, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Vering said, affronted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go find a place for us to hide in the corridor, if we’re going to wait.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All three of them understood that this was a request to dismiss Vering, without saying as much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duke Braunschweig will be happy to hear you’re giving me so much responsibility, sir,” Vering said with a scowl. He narrowed his eyes at the two of them, but left the command dais, watching over his shoulder as Ansbach sat back down in the command chair and activated the silence barrier. Yang stood at his shoulder, and Ansbach didn’t look at him, instead staring out at the stars on the screen ahead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you plan this, Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Plan? No,” Yang said. “I explicitly planned to not have this happen. If I wanted Mittermeyer to participate, I would have had him meet us at Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you’re not surprised.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two of the most talented and willing men I know are being intentionally sidelined in this war, to deprive me of allies,” Yang said. “No, I’m not surprised that they decided to take the initiative.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Reuenthal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he coming as well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how he could,” Yang said. “Mittermeyer has ships— he was assigned to be the commander of a shipbuilding facility. Reuenthal is still on Odin, with no way to get off, as far as I know. But I’m sure he’s the one coordinating this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t need to get rid of Vering to ask me that,” Yang pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mittermeyer has no reason to be loyal to the duke.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, he doesn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But he’s loyal to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang was silent for a second. “I already told you, I’m not trying to take the crown for myself. I thought you believed me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me believing you when you say that is not the problem,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of the things the duke suspects me of, I don’t think that kind of treason is one of them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I believe you,” Ansbach continued, as though Yang hadn’t said anything. “Your friends, on the other hand—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang thought about the look on Mittermeyer’s face when Reuenthal had placed the crown of leaves on his head. Shock-wide eyes, cheeks shiny and flushed with alcohol and something else. It was for the best that Ansbach wasn’t looking at him at the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mittermeyer isn’t a man with that kind of ambition,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So he’s just here out of friendship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes— that’s the reason.”</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>They waited.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang assured everyone that they would see a sign, and soon. He felt a little too much like a prophet making his pleas to Merkatz and the duke. But he was sure of what was going on. If they began their attack on Iserlohn without waiting for the signal that Mittermeyer’s forces were in place, they would end up in an uncoordinated, and therefore lost, battle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat in the darkness of the corridor, in interstellar space light-hours away from the fortress, with all their listening arrays and telescopes turned towards Iserlohn. There was no way to get closer without risking detection, so they had to accept the several hour information delay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the sign came, Yang was on the bridge. He wasn’t the first to see it, though the image of Iserlohn was projected in odd radio-signal false-color on the forward screen of the bridge. The telescope operator noticed it first, and shouted, “Sir! The Thor Hammer!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t have time to feel vindication. If that emotion passed through his consciousness, it was quickly drowned out by the sinking feeling of battle approaching.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig stood from his command chair and immediately gave the order for the fleet to move. Yang wasn’t paying much attention to that— the sound of Braunschweig’s voice occupied a tiny corner of his awareness. His eyes were fixed on the display in front of them. The telescope operator had seen the ripples beneath the skin of Iserlohn’s perfect liquid metal shell, signaling the movement of the Thor Hammer, but it took merely seconds after that for the beam to lance out into space, heading towards an enemy that they couldn’t see on their scopes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The beam itself was only visible when it hit something, but the space around Iserlohn was cluttered with the microscopic— atomic— debris of past battles, and those absorbed some infinitesimal fraction of the Thor Hammer’s energy, and glowed like the sun in their instruments’ views.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a little concerning to Yang that Muckenburger had chosen to use the Thor Hammer rather than deploying the Iserlohn Fortress Fleet against the attackers on the other side. It might not matter, but it did mean that Muckenburger was holding the fleet in reserve, presumably waiting for Yang to make his appearance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t know what forces Mittermeyer had brought with him, but the force on Cahokia had always been a way to split Iserlohn’s attention. It consisted of just enough ships and resources to form a viable threat if nothing was done about it, but Braunschweig’s main fleet was intended to be greater. The real strength of the Cahokia fleet was in ground troops, which would need to enter Iserlohn and take it from the inside, if there wasn’t a surrender.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As their fleet accelerated to faster than light speeds, they lost sight of what was happening at Iserlohn. The screens above displayed their position relative to the fortress, and nothing else. It felt like they were crawling forward, but they would be within the Thor Hammer’s range in less than half an hour.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whenever anyone opened the door to the bridge, the air was flooded with the wailing alarms that summoned everyone to their stations. The atmosphere was chaotic: people performing last minute checks on their weapons controls and yelling out fleet positioning instructions to transmit to their other ships as soon as they dropped back down to sub-light speeds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Merkatz, in his own ship ahead, was to be the true commander of the battle, within minutes, Braunschweig had his usual cadre gathered around him. Flegel was at his right hand, Ansbach right behind him, and Vering lingered at edge of the command dais, always not sure where he was supposed to be. Yang, who had been leaning against the back wall and looking up at what was going on, walked over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We won’t go into the Thor Hammer’s range,” Yang said to Vering, quietly. “At least not until—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did I ask?” Vering snapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang shrugged, then stepped forward to join Braunschweig. Despite his verbal annoyance, Vering stayed on Yang’s heels.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long will it take for Muckenburger to deploy his fleet?” Braunschweig was asking Ansbach. Ansbach glanced at Yang when he arrived, so Yang offered an answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think he’ll do it as soon as he sees us,” Yang said. “He’s clearly holding it back for us to arrive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will we still use our bombardment strategy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll start that way,”  Yang said. “We have to make the first move— sitting outside the Thor Hammer’s range without firing a shot would just lead to our allies exhausting themselves for no reason.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merkatz is plenty of a match for the fortress fleet,” Braunschweig declared. This was likely true. Since Muckenburger himself was on Iserlohn, and the command structure of the fortress had been rearranged prior to the civil war to root out any potentially dangerous elements, the commander of the fleet was a less experienced man than Muckenburger himself, who Yang expected would remain within the fortress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, Braunschweig’s confidence had the opposite of the intended effect in Yang. He felt strangely helpless, perhaps even moreso than he had felt when they had fought outside of Odin. He had written the plan, had gone over it extensively with Merkatz, but it was entirely out of his control now. He would stay at Braunschweig’s side and advise, but he felt the limits of his usefulness quite keenly. To plan the attack, he had leaned on the feeling of playing his old games with Reuenthal and Mittermeyer, but now he felt far less like a player, and more like a puppet, lurching across a stage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They dropped out of faster than light travel a hairsbreadth out of the Thor Hammer’s effective range. With the fortress’s giant laser occupied with keeping the attack on the other side of the corridor at bay, they could advance in relative safety, but not too close.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When their instruments could take stock of the scene, they discovered it was far more chaotic than they had expected. Their radios were suddenly awash in communications, most of them using the new garbled encryption that Iserlohn Fortress had employed, but some that made it through were able to be deciphered— the ships on the opposite side of Iserlohn were broadcasting in an Alliance cipher which had been cracked prior to the outbreak of the civil war. The Alliance had not yet realized that their communications in that particular mode had been compromised, and so the radio chatter of Spartinian pilots barking out their kills was clear as day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did we come in early?” Ansbach asked. For the first time, Yang heard a touch of real fear in the crisp edge of his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “Listen to what they’re saying—” He realized belatedly that only he spoke the Alliance language.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence between everyone standing at the command dais as the radio operator honed in to one of the clearest signals, though even that was garbled with static.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fucking new strategy— don’t see the fucking point. Corner us in here? Augh.” The pilot’s open mic captured the hup-hup-hup of him forcing his breath into his lungs as he executed a too-tight turn in his dogfighter. “Foxtrot— on your six. I hate this, man. Feels unnatural to sortie out behind our fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are they saying?” Braunschweig demanded, looking at Yang, narrowing his eyes. The other Spartinian pilot on the channel responded as Braunschweig talked over him, but then the transmission faded into static as the pilots moved where their instruments could no longer pick up the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang gesticulated, trying to illustrate the situation as he saw it. “They’ve lured an All— a rebel patrol fleet in there,” he said. “The rebels haven’t realized what’s going on, yet— that the Imperial fleet they’re seeing is at cross purposes with the fortress. Our allies are trying to push them towards the fortress, but it’s a bit of a standstill, it looks like. They have their Spartinians out to protect their backs so that the main fleet can turn around before they’re forced into Iserlohn’s range.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that... good?” Vering asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang ran his hand through his hair. “I’ll trust that they know what they’re doing on the other side,” Yang said. “Our fleet on Cahokia is a match for a little corridor patrol fleet, certainly. I’m sure at first it was just a way to keep the fortress from seeing what was really happening— distract them with the threat of a rebel attack— but they must know now what’s going on, since we can see it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does this change anything about our plans?” Braunschweig asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Yang said. “I think as soon as Mittermeyer sees that we’ve arrived, he’ll let the rebels retreat. There’s no sense in wasting lives fighting them, now that they’ve served their purposes of keeping the Thor Hammer occupied while we approach. The rebels don’t want to attack Iserlohn— they’ll retreat as soon as they see an opportunity. It would have been nice if the fleet had been lured out and away from the fortress— I’m sure that was the goal— but Muckenburger is too conservative for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig stopped listening to Yang long before Yang stopped talking. He gave his orders— for the bombardment of the fortress to begin. Already, Merkatz had spread out their line of ships, preparing their barrage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first wave of missiles went out, a coordinated push. Since the missiles had so far to travel— the entire effective range of the Thor Hammer— the floating gun turrets of Iserlohn would have plenty of time to shoot them down one by one. But there was always the chance that some of them would make it, and the more that were sent out together, the harder the gun turrets would have to work to get them all. The second wave followed not long after.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite the launch of the missiles, the Iserlohn Fortress fleet didn’t emerge immediately. The fortress continued to fire the Thor Hammer in the direction of the Alliance fleet behind it, Mittermeyer continuing to try to press the Alliance ships towards the fortress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first of their missiles came within range of the fortress’s floating gun turrets. They fired rapidly, changing targets as quickly as they could, and before the missiles could approach Iserlohn, most of them were destroyed. Only a few made it, and they exploded near-harmlessly against the gleaming surface, causing barely a ripple.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This had been expected, of course. Already, another wave of missiles was approaching, and another behind that. Each time, more and more of the explosions took place on the surface of Iserlohn itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>These preliminary blows were making Braunschweig impatient.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why aren’t they sending out the fleet?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s baiting us into approaching, sir,” Yang said. He illustrated with his hands. “If he makes us think that the Thor Hammer is occupied, we might be tempted to creep in towards the fortress, and get in too deep to escape in time, when he turns it around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s lip curled— it was clear he was already thinking of ordering their fleet to go further in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang couldn’t stop talking. “A worse plan would be like this— if we had enough forces on either side to be able to sacrifice them, we could just walk in. Advance on this side, bait out the blow, our forces on the other side come that much closer, just running forward as soon as the fortress looks away and taking the hit—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t have that kind of manpower,” Ansbach said, cutting in before Braunschweig could get any ideas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not,” Yang said. “We can’t go forward yet. We need the fleet to come out, like we planned.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if they don’t?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They have to,” Yang said. “If we destroy the fortress’s shell with missiles, we’d be able to destroy the Thor Hammer itself— and then walk right up to the fortress. Muckenburger knows that. As soon as we’ve done enough damage to the floating turrets, he’ll have to launch the fleet. We just have to be patient.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Patience was not one of Braunschweig’s virtues. He paced back and forth, watching the action in front of them. The surface of Iserlohn shimmered, like a pond disrupted by rain, as their missiles struck home again and again. After each wave, they took out several more of the floating turrets, making each further launch of missiles more effective.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had stopped picking up radio signals from the Alliance forces on the other side of the corridor. This was because of communications jamming from Iserlohn itself— someone had realized that the last thing they wanted was for the two halves of Braunschweig’s forces to be able to communicate and coordinate their attack. It left Yang blind to what was happening over there, except for the very regular firings of the Thor Hammer. He expected that Mittermeyer had let the Alliance fleet retreat by now, and was dancing back and forth just outside of the Thor Hammer’s range and sending small contingents of his fleet forward, or missiles or other bombardments that were small enough that they wouldn’t be tempting targets for the giant laser itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the plan had originally come to Yang, so many months ago that it now felt like a different lifetime, he had been sitting at his desk in his old boarding house, looking out at the garden. A hawk had been swooped by a whole host of sparrows, each one tiny in comparison to the large black bird, but they dived and pecked and harried it until it gathered enough speed to escape. At the time, Yang couldn’t help but root for the victim, and was glad to see it get away. If it hadn’t been fast enough, it would have fallen to the ground and been picked apart— no matter how large and wicked its claws and beak were, they couldn’t be in ten places at once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, Iserlohn Fortress was completely immobile, and Yang had plenty of sparrows at his disposal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The surface of the fortress rippled again. But this time, it wasn’t from their missile strikes. Ships emerged: the Iserlohn Fortress Fleet, coming out to fight at last. To not waste ammunition, Merkatz immediately ordered the bombardment with missiles to stop. They began firing at the oncoming fleet with their main guns. This wouldn’t have much effect until the two fleets were much closer. Merkatz allowed the Imperial fleet to advance much more quickly than they moved forward— still wary of the Thor Hammer even with the promise of the enemy fleet as a shield.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz advanced their fleet, moving into the Thor Hammer’s range. As they crossed the invisible demarcation of safety, Yang glanced over at Vering, who was studying the map on the large display, pale but not looking like he was about to run.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re using the fleet to buy us space,” Yang said. “Muckenburger doesn’t want to fire on his own men. We can push them back towards the fortress and get closer that way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But even as he said this, Yang felt suddenly unsure. He had made this plan by studying Muckenburger’s battle record, and remembering the fateful meeting where he had been dragged in front of the fleet high command at gunpoint, to explain how Iserlohn had almost fallen, once. The commander of Iserlohn at the time had fired on his own men to stop the Alliance. Yang thought Muckenburger wouldn’t do the same.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger was a career soldier, a conservative one, not known for snap decisions or grudges that overwhelmed reason. Yang’s impression, during their last conversation, had been that he was well aware of the fortress’s weaknesses, and knew that it could fall, but he would stretch the battle out. Any siege of Iserlohn was winnable— the question was how much Yang was willing to pay. Muckenburger was betting that there was some cost that was too high, and that he could force Yang to pay it quickly, without weakening the fortress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz concentrated his fire from their fleet on the foremost portion of the advancing Iserlohn fleet. Under normal circumstances, the oncoming fleet would have slightly shifted their posture, tried to return fire enough to prevent any one area of their line from becoming too weak, but the Imperial fleet was slow to respond. Even as the tip of their line visibly frayed, it took far too long for the command to be issued to change their firing pattern or reorganize their front line. This could have been the result of a truly inexperienced commander being sent out, but Yang didn’t think so.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sweat on Yang’s back turned to ice. “Sir,” he said to Braunschweig. “Order Merkatz to send out Valkyries ahead of us,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A hunch,” Yang said. “We shouldn’t get too close. Pull back. Bait them out of the Thor Hammer’s range.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s your hunch?” Ansbach asked. Every second that they stood discussing it was another fraction of the way closer to the fortress, the more devastating a blow from the Thor Hammer would be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think those ships have anyone in them,” Yang said. “I think we’re being lured in. If they’re unmanned, the Valkyries will be able to pick them off— they won’t have their own Valkyries to launch— no pilots.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if you’re wrong, we won’t have a Valkyrie contingent left,” Braunschweig said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just hold here, then—” Yang said. “Let them get closer. See how they react.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig thought about it for a second, then gave the order, though it was in a grudging tone. The Iserlohn fleet continued its advance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Over their radios, Yang could hear Merkatz begin to test the advancing fleet, giving orders to switch up their own fleet movement to see how the ghost ships would react. He was a masterful commander, and had picked up the nuances of the situation immediately: if they did not let anyone in the fortress know that they were aware that the ships were unmanned, they had an advantage of knowledge. What they could do with that advantage, Yang hadn’t yet determined. But Merkatz moved the fleet in such a way that the testing wasn’t obvious— these were standard fleet maneuvers, pushing one side of the line forwards, trying to poke at the enemy flank, rushing and baiting. To an observer, it would look like Merkatz testing the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy in a normal way before they started really pressing the line forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It became clearer and clearer that the ships were inhumanly sluggish. They didn’t react to changes in Merkatz’s posture in any complicated ways, and the way they moved as a fleet was mechanically coordinated. In a normal fleet advance, each individual ship would have the ability to choose its own targets, and move to a better position to fire. Here, the fleet moved as one solid mass, leaving many of its ships at dead angles to the targets they might want to hit. They fired anyway, but their guns blasted off into the emptiness of space, missing the Braunschweig fleet completely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was enough to convince Braunschweig. Unfortunately, it meant that their plan to approach Iserlohn using the fleet as a shield was dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz continued to push the fake fleet around. There was only so much time he could waste with this maneuver before Iserlohn figured out that they knew the trick— they would have to change their plans soon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang closed his eyes, not looking at the faux battle taking place outside. Behind him, he could hear Braunschweig speaking in an annoyed, low voice to Ansbach, asking him if Merkatz should simply destroy the ships ahead of them. If Yang didn’t think of a way to use the information to their advantage quickly, they would lose it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ghost ships. It was annoying that the ghost ships could see what they were doing. They couldn’t simply make ghost ships of their own to sacrifice to the Thor Hammer— the empty ships had cameras trained on them, and would see any evacuation happening. ‘</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were being controlled by people in the fortress— there certainly hadn’t been enough time for the ships to be given any kind of mechanical autonomy in this situation. That was why they moved so slowly and clumsily, because humans in the fortress had to control the ghost fleet as one block.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was the real advantage Yang had. They couldn’t react very fast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The plan was settling into Yang’s brain. He didn’t like it, but it was the only thing he could think of that might work. It was all a question of timing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach noticed when Yang finally opened his eyes and looked over at Braunschweig.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have an idea?” Ansbach asked. Braunschweig, with narrowed eyes, turned to look at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Yang said. “I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a question of timing.” And then he explained, the pieces clicking firmly into place as he spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Although it clearly burned Braunschweig, the Berlin had to remain outside of the Thor Hammer’s range. This plan was far too dangerous for Braunschweig himself to lead the charge. They pulled back, along with about a third of the fleet, and lingered outside of Iserlohn’s striking distance, watching the battle from afar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ahead of them, with the other two-thirds of the fleet, Merkatz began pushing the ghost ships back into Iserlohn’s controlled space. As expected, it was very easy to push them back. They continued to fight, just to keep up the pretense, but it was the goal of the ghost ships to lure Merkatz as close to the fortress as possible. They played along, inching forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inside the middle section of those ships, all of their crews were preparing to evacuate. They couldn’t create their own ghost ships, but they could do the next best thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The difficulty, as Yang had told Braunschweig, was that the timing had to be clockwork perfect. That was difficult.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An escape pod traveled at a known speed. The beam width of the Thor Hammer at various distances from the fortress was also a known quantity. It was relatively simple math, on paper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang watched the action as it played out. They had lost radio contact with Merkatz and his section of the fleet as soon as they had gotten any distance away— the ghost ships were employing severe radio jamming— but they could still see it all on their telescopes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ships had started pushing forward at a perfectly timed moment, such that they would hit a point in space where the Thor Hammer’s beam width was exactly the distance that the escape pods could travel in ten minutes, which was exactly the time between Iserlohn’s very regular firings of the Thor Hammer on the other side. It wasn’t as close to the fortress as Yang would have preferred, but that also meant that Iserlohn was unlikely to fire on them early, which would have killed everyone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Thor Hammer fired another warning shot at Mittermeyer’s fleet on the other side of the fortress. At exactly that moment, Merkatz gave the command to move his fleet in the way Yang had described.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz’s fleet took on a spindle formation and abruptly accelerated. There were deceptively few ships that stood between them and the fortress, and it was easy to break through their line. Merkatz had been slowly picking a central hole in the ghost fleet the entire time it was being pushed back, and it had been spread thinly to begin with, making it look bigger than it really was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as Merkatz’s fleet broke through, the fleet split into different sections. Two peeled off on either side, trying to keep the perfect distance between themselves and the fortress, while the central column charged ahead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The escape pods that had flown out from the central column of ships were too small to see on their telescopes, but Yang knew they were headed out. With any luck, they were too small for Iserlohn to detect, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Behind them, the ghost fleet struggled to turn around, but they were irrelevant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With ships charging at Iserlohn, there was no choice but to use the Thor Hammer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even if Muckenburger knew that the central column of ships was now equally ghost-like to his own fleet, it still needed to be dealt with before he could attack the wings of the fleet. Some of the Braunschweig family atomics were armed and on board the rushing ships: if they reached the surface of Iserlohn, the fortress would be breached.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Thor Hammer began to move, the surface of the fortress rippling as it swung into a new position, turning to point towards Merkatz’s charge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that it was facing towards them, Yang shuddered. The central eye of it glowed a menacing yellow as it regained its strength to fire again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang couldn’t tell what was happening on the other side of Iserlohn, but he suspected two things: Mittermeyer would be trying to take advantage of this opening as much as he could, and Muckenburger would be sending out what remained of the Iserlohn Fleet to stop him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t stop himself from thinking about that, picturing it in vivid detail, even as the battle continued in front of him. Mittermeyer surely had the situation well in hand, Yang told himself. Despite feeling frustrated at himself for thinking about Mittermeyer alone, rather than the thousands of men in danger on this side of the fortress, it was where his mind stayed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The giant laser fired, arcing out across space and melting both ghost fleets into indistinguishable slag. This did manage to shock Yang’s thoughts away from Mittermeyer, and he held his breath as the beam’s glow faded to embers, hoping that all the escape pods had made it out of the path.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that the Thor Hammer was exposed on the side of the fortress, it displaced many of the floating gun turrets that had previously been fending off the worst of the missile strikes. The final element of Yang’s timing plan went into play. The two remaining wings of the Braunschweig fleet continued to approach Iserlohn from either side, spiraling in. Ahead of them, they sent out a wave of their fastest missiles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With the Thor Hammer still recharging, the floating turrets displaced, and the fleet occupied on the other side of the fortress with Mittermeyer, the missiles struck home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Many of them impacted the area around the Thor Hammer’s great eye. A glittering wave of the liquid metal shell swelled around its raised edges, rippling in towards the lip of the eye, then out again in a wave around the fortress. They traveled at the wave propagation speed of the liquid metal. Although these waves were as tall and wide as a destroyer, they still appeared tiny and slow as they crawled across Iserlohn’s surface. Yang followed them with his eyes on the magnified view of Iserlohn overhead, involuntarily focusing on something else as the last wave of missiles struck true home— the exposed center of the Thor Hammer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was still glowing, recharging for its next strike— it was already painfully bright to look at on the telescope view, an overexposed pure camera white in the center. It was nearly ready to fire again, which made the impacts of the missiles that much more deadly. All that energy had to go somewhere, and since it couldn’t be sent out, it remained to boil the fortress itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The explosions of the missiles striking the center of the Thor Hammer were even brighter. They briefly washed out the entire view, and when the cameras adjusted their light-sensitivity to get the view in focus, they were left with a scene of slowly unfolding destruction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The central column that made up the Thor Hammer’s firing chamber began to collapse in on itself. It glowed an odd shade of fire blue: the liquid metal waves crashed over the hole in the fortress’s side, then caught fire as they fell. The complicated molecule that formed the liquid metal shell broke apart into its raw components, oxygen and iron and some other elements Yang couldn’t remember or name. It melted into parts of Iserlohn’s structure, further widening the gyre, spreading the exothermic reaction outwards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The opening grew wider as more and more of the liquid metal was pulled inside, looking like a gaping wound, or a giant maw swallowing the fortress from inside out. It would stabilize when someone within the fortress turned off the gravity engine, but that would take some time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For now, Braunschweig ordered his section of the fleet forward, towards the fortress. Yang didn’t hear him. Their cameras trained on the popped soap bubble kept it the same size on the large screen overhead, only sharpening in detail as they grew closer, revealing the gory extent of the damage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were a million people in Iserlohn, Yang knew. The damage he had conspired to do would kill an untold number of them. He still didn’t know what had become of the soldiers who had escaped the ships that charged the fortress— if the timing had been right, if they had escaped the Thor Hammer’s fury. He didn’t know how Mittermeyer was faring on the other side of the corridor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Behind Yang, Braunschweig and Flegel were celebrating their victory. It was a victory— as clean of a victory over Iserlohn fortress as Yang could picture. The Alliance would have killed an untold number of people to accomplish what Yang had done. This would likely win the civil war for Braunschweig.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang should have felt pleased. But looking at the hole in Iserlohn’s side, he felt only an echo of that yawning horror within himself.</span>

  <p>
  <em>
    <span>February 489 I.C., Inside the Iserlohn Corridor</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach advised Braunschweig not to bring the flagship directly towards Iserlohn, to instead wait outside, perhaps even take a contingent of the fleet further away, to wait until all the fighting stopped. Braunschweig had no patience for arguments about safety, however, and the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin </span>
  </em>
  <span>sailed directly towards the gaping hole in the fortress’s side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig considered the battle won, despite the fact that the fortress had in no way surrendered. Perhaps he was right, but that didn’t mean that making their way to the control room would be easy. Landing the ship within the fortress’s walls would make it vulnerable to boarding, and lingering near the outside would leave them open to attacks by the remaining fortress fleet, or any floating gun turrets that the fortress managed to reactivate. They would have to fight their way through the corridors to take real control, in any case.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang stood by the radio, several times trying to hail Iserlohn and ask for a surrender, but there was no response. Braunschweig had only given him permission to do this because he knew that there wouldn’t be an answer to any of Yang’s radio calls. Still, Yang felt an obligation to try. If he could prevent any further loss of life, he would call as many times as it took.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fortress was still jamming communications between their fleet and Mittermeyer’s, but now that they approached closer, they could see flashes of light from the other side— the signs of a fierce battle raging between the remaining ships of the fortress fleet and Mittermeyer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger knew that the bulk of the landing forces were in Mittermeyer’s camp— he was well aware of the composition of the troops that Braunschweig had sent to Cahokia. His only viable path to victory was to prevent Mittermeyer’s forces from landing in the fortress. If Braunschweig’s fleet failed to take direct control of the fortress’s interior, and Mittermeyer’s fleet was prevented from landing, then the fortress wouldn’t have fallen completely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang kept up his useless attempts at radioing the fortress for long after it became clear that his effort was being wasted. With each call, though he kept his voice calm, he felt something calcify further in his heart. As the hole in the fortress’s side loomed larger and larger on the screen at the front of the bridge, Yang finally made a decision.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the chaos of the bridge, no one noticed him slip out. No one except Hans von Vering, anyway. Yang didn’t realize he was being followed until he was in the middle of keying in his access code to one of the equipment storerooms: he heard Vering’s characteristically heavy footsteps behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang turned his head to look at Vering, and finished punching in his PIN blindly. The lock clicked, and he held the door open as he spoke. “Did Ansbach tell you to follow me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering scowled. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then is there a reason you’re following me?” Yang stepped into the storeroom, and Vering followed on his heels. The shelves of equipment and hangers for the exosuits were nearly empty, but there were a few things left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing?” Vering demanded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does it look like I’m doing?” Yang ran his hand across the few remaining exosuits and picked out one in his size. He struggled to shake it off its hanger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Something stupid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not illegal,” Yang said. “Even the illustrious Goldenbaum Dynasty hasn’t figured out how to forbid that completely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering wasn’t sure how to respond to that. Yang sat down on one of the scuffed plastic benches and began pulling the suit on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to tell Commodore Ansbach.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go ahead.” He cocked his head at Vering. “It’s not like this is a secret. I’m going to march back up to the bridge in a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This, Yang couldn’t argue with. He nodded and continued wrestling with the legs of the suit. When was the last time he had worn one of these? Cahokia— when he had very briefly been Annerose von Müsel’s prisoner. The memory was almost funny.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering watched Yang. “I don’t know what you’re doing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Muckenburger won’t surrender to Braunschweig as things stand,” Yang said. “And I don’t think the duke or the baron will be particularly convincing on that front.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang focused on securing the breastplate of the exosuit. “Someone has to try, make a real effort, and not just blindly demand an unconditional surrender,” he said. “I know the fleet admiral, anyway. And I don’t want this to lead to any more death than it has to. I’d like to at least be in the room, if there’s anything I can do. Maybe there isn’t, but—” Yang realized he was rambling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vering was silent, and this caused Yang to look up and watch the strange tumble of emotions passing across his face. They ended in a sneer when Vering realized that Yang was looking at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone’s going to kill you,” Vering said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope not.” Yang stood, and tucked the helmet of the exosuit under his arm: the grim death’s head. He took a few steps towards the door of the supply room, unfamiliar with the weight of his steps in the suit’s shoes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here,” Vering said. He took a rifle out of one of the wall cabinets and held it out to Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what would I do with that? I couldn’t hit the broadside of a destroyer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, the faux detachment in Vering’s voice cracked— at least enough that Yang could hear what was beneath it. “I thought you didn’t want to die.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang took the rifle, though he gently nudged Vering aside and hung it back up on the wall. “You’re right. But I don’t want this to end with the entire Iserlohn fleet being wiped out. The faster we can get a surrender from Muckenburger, the fewer people need to die in general.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what about me?” Vering asked. He blurted it out without thinking— the words came out with an involuntary whine, and his cheeks reddened. “Sir,” he tacked on, as if that made any difference.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang held open the door to the stockroom to let Vering out. They walked together towards the bridge, without Yang saying anything for a little while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll make sure that the duke doesn’t do anything that would make all of this worse than worthless,” Yang said. “I’d really appreciate if you at least stopped him from stepping a foot outside this ship until the coast is clear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Vering said. His voice was tight, like he was speaking past a lump in his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is something the matter?” Yang asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were approaching the bridge again. The men who rushed past ignored them entirely. Yang stopped before they reached the doors to the bridge, lingering with Vering for a moment in the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you ever tell anyone that I was a coward?” Vering asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were far too many things Yang could have said in answer to that question, and Vering would hate most of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It hadn’t even been pragmatism— trying to curry favor with the man who was the would-be king consort. It might have been easier if it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked around the busy hallway, and rubbed the back of his head with his free hand. He didn’t meet Vering’s eyes. “I don’t value heroism all that much,” Yang said. “It’s good to want to live.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was clearly an unsatisfactory answer for Vering, who didn’t say anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang sighed and offered a reluctant smile. “I sometimes think that if everyone had the strength to be a coward, to refuse to be pushed into the desire to be great, we’d live in a much better universe— or at least one with far less death and war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I understand you, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s alright. It doesn’t matter.” He smiled again and shoved open the door to the bridge. Vering didn’t follow Yang in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was even more chaotic in there than it was in the hallway. While Yang had been gone, Baron Flegel, who had appointed himself in charge of the landing team to take the fortress from the inside, had also gotten dressed in an exosuit, and was talking with Braunschweig and gesturing to the image of Iserlohn on the screen overhead. Ansbach, who was also over by Braunschweig, looked up when Yang came in. He broke off from that group and came over to Yang, not even trying to hide the foul expression on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you think you’re doing?” he asked. The answer was obvious, and Ansbach didn’t even wait for Yang to answer. “You don’t have your little red dog to protect you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like to be the one to speak with Muckenburger,” Yang said. “That’s worth the risk to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It shouldn’t be,” Ansbach said. “And do me the favor of not saying that to Flegel, since he’s very excited to be the one to make Muckenburger surrender.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what should I say? I think I’ll have an easier time talking to Muckenburger than Flegel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing,” Ansbach said. “Let me do the talking, if there has to be any.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang looked over Ansbach’s shoulder at Flegel, who was looking up at the image of Iserlohn on the big screen with a slick smile. “Will there even be a chance for talking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach frowned. “I’ll do my best to convince him to take the Fleet Admiral prisoner,” Ansbach said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rather than killing him outright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want a repeat of Geiersburg either,” Ansbach snapped. “I’ll do what I can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what can I do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing. If Muckenburger becomes a prisoner, you can talk to him yourself after— maybe prevent him from going to a firing squad. But that’s later— I’d prefer if you didn’t come now. You’re dead weight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There wasn’t much Yang could say to contradict that, so he shrugged. “I’d like to at least be there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s—” There wasn’t any way to put it that didn’t sound stupid, even to him. “Muckenburger is only doing this because of me,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never thought one of your flaws was self-absorption, My Lord,” Ansbach said with a sneer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to insist I stay behind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach looked back at Braunschweig, and Braunschweig beckoned him back over. “If someone asks you why you need to tag along, say you have some suspicion about a plan, or it will be easier for you to coordinate with the Cahokia forces if you’re in the fortress and can use their radios to communicate,” Ansbach said over his shoulder as he walked away. It was a fine excuse, so Yang nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang leaned on the wall— there would be plenty of time before they made it into Iserlohn. Even Flegel wasn’t stupid enough to go in at the head of the attack, so they would have to wait for the first wave of boarders from other ships to clear the way to the fortress’s nerve center, and then Flegel’s team would enter to take real control of the situation. Flegel was pacing the bridge smugly. Yang remembered Flegel had never really liked Muckenburger— it seemed that this was a personal moment for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There still hadn’t been any communications from Mittermeyer, despite the radio operator’s repeated attempts to hail them through Iserlohn’s jamming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach finished speaking with Braunschweig, then left the bridge. He returned just a few minutes later dressed in his own exosuit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they had gotten word that their vanguard forces had cleared a significant path through Iserlohn, Flegel’s group all gathered up and headed for the rear of the ship. No one commented on Yang’s presence, perhaps because as soon as he slipped on the heavy helmet, he looked indistinguishable from all the rest of the soldiers in the group. He stayed close to Ansbach, who kept his visor flipped up to more easily speak to Flegel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin </span>
  </em>
  <span>descended through the liquid metal shell that surrounded Iserlohn, the walls of the ship rumbled and groaned disconcertingly, causing the members of their boarding party, standing in the back loading bay, to look around with concern. From the outside, the waves in Iserlohn’s shell had looked like they were diminished, but that had been an illusion. Parts of the metal were still superheated, and all of it was still moving. The ships of Braunschweig’s fleet descending through the outer layer created even more ripples, like sticks held in the path of a flowing stream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From the back of the ship, they couldn’t see much— nothing other than the string of numbers that the bridge reported to them, their position relative to Iserlohn’s beacons updating on the tablet clutched in an NCO’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They knew that to stave off further damage from the liquid metal shell collapsing into the fortress, Iserlohn had modulated the force coming out of its great gravity engine. If it was still turned on at all, it was only minimally, to stop the liquid metal from escaping off into space. But that meant that there would be no walking normally inside Iserlohn— they would be weightless. Every member of the landing party was given a fuel pack to help them move, at least until they got into the tight corridors of Iserlohn and could kick off the walls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang strapped it onto his back unhappily, and when he struggled to tighten the chest straps, Ansbach reached over and fastened them without speaking. Through the hard shell of the exosuit, Yang couldn’t feel the touch at all, except in the way that Ansbach pulled him forward and then shoved him away, testing the strength of the straps up near his shoulders with a sharp jerk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Most of the men were armed with rifles and axes. The rifles would likely be useless, but that didn’t stop men from carrying them. Iserlohn had procedures for flooding every corridor with Zephyr particles, to make life harder for invaders trying to cut their way through sealed doorways.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin </span>
  </em>
  <span>didn’t so much land in Iserlohn’s bays as knock into them. Even the engine’s inertial dampeners couldn’t stop everyone from feeling the jolt, accompanied by a scream of metal, as they came to a stop. The normal docking clamps, rather than welcoming the ship in, had barred their way, and the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>’s pilot had brought them as close as he could. They were aiming for the doors closest to the bridge— fighting their way through Iserlohn’s entire sixty kilometer diameter would be an impossible task.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the bay doors opened, and their team began to rush out, the scale of chaos was revealed. The docking area was full of ships, most not even latched onto anything. Those that were still unloading men simply floated in the docking space and opened their back bay doors, letting out a stream of soldiers into the air— some distinguishable as men, others mere fly-like specks off in the great distance. They moved in swarms, heading for the holes where doors had already been cut in Iserlohn’s interior walls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their group left the shelter of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, jumping off the edge of its open bay door and feeling the lack of gravity catch them. On normal occasions, it was difficult to notice how large ships were, but emerging from beneath it was like coming out of the shadow of a mountain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although he was clumsy with the controls of his propulsion pack, being weightless was a strangely nostalgic feeling for Yang— reminiscent of his very early childhood on his father’s ship. The sudden sense of memory, and its associated melancholy, washed over him, crowding out most of the fear. Looking at the ruins of Iserlohn that surrounded him, he felt more sadness than anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All told, he had never spent much time in the fortress, but he had always liked it, despite what it was. Even if some of his fondest memories had not taken place inside its walls, he still would have felt the same. Iserlohn was a machine of war, but she was beautiful, in her own way. And Yang had dealt her a fatal blow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The way had already been cleared for them, and their group stuck to the open passageways. Although he had spent so much time mapping out the ideal routes through the labyrinthine corridors, it was nevertheless very disorienting to see Iserlohn invaded. When Yang had written his plans, he had pictured the hallways empty and serene, with ghostly hands opening doors in front of him. When he compared the hard reality to the memory of his plan, to see how well things were progressing, he felt like he was seeing double: the whole and unharmed Iserlohn seen through one eye, while the other bore witness to doors torn off hinges, walls pulled apart, and mangled bodies drifting through the corridors without the influence of gravity to hold them down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some of the bodies left trails of blood in the air when people knocked them out of the way, bunting them down the hallway so that the passage was clear for everyone to get through. The blood collected in droplets, some the size of a fingernail, and hovered red-black in the air. When Braunschweig’s soldiers charged through the hall, the drops spattered against their pure white exosuit armor, sometimes streaking in lines, other times exploding into a fine mist. Because Iserlohn’s usual air filtration system had been disabled— probably to keep the Zephyr particles in the air as long as possible— the drops remained where they were, until the passing of a person stirred up the air and sent them moving like motes of dust.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The process of getting through each closed door was painstaking. The Zephyr gas prevented the use of plasma cutters, as they would explode violently upon contact with the heat. The walls were drilled through with hand tools, cooled with a stream of water to avoid sparking, and then a small explosive charge was set in the resulting hole. The nearby areas were cleared, and then the charge was released, exploding the gas and causing massive damage to the sealed room. The door could then be opened either normally or with plasma cutters, as the Zephyr particles had been depleted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was during this process that their boarding teams tended to be cornered and attacked, the Iserlohn garrison rushing in from other directions when the boarding team couldn’t move forward. This, repeated over and over, had left a trail of bodies in the hallways— breadcrumbs of suffering marking a trail through towards the bridge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was impossible to tell at a glance which of the bodies that scattered the hallways were Imperial forces and which were Braunschweig’s men— the uniforms were the same, except for the small engraved Braunschweig crest on the breastplates. Yang ran his hand over the matching engraving on his own chest. The hard fingers of his exosuit gloves caught on the indentation, but he couldn’t feel it as anything other than the slipping of slick ceramics against each other. When he looked at his gloved hand, he noticed it was smeared with someone else’s blood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With his helmet on, Yang couldn’t hear the sounds of any fighting off in the distance, but he kept track of its position relative to their party by listening to the radio updates of those ahead. They weren’t very near to the danger right now, but they were moving rapidly through the already-cleared corridors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Beneath the suits, it was hard to tell what everyone else in the group was feeling: the nuance of body language was stifled by the heavy clothing, and confused by the way that everyone was forced to move without gravity. He glanced over at Ansbach several times, though Ansbach didn’t look at him. He was holding his axe tightly in his hands, his rifle slung across his back, forgotten.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Along the way, at most hallway intersections, they passed contingents of Braunschweig’s men, holding the path clear for them. The Iserlohn garrison forces could approach from almost any direction, but there were reinforcements everywhere along the route.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel had muscled his way to the front of their group, despite the protests from the squad that was there for his protection. He had eschewed an axe— Yang doubted he was much good with one— but he kept an elaborate blade in his hand, the same shape and size as the standard kit knife, but the flat of the blade was engraved, and gold wire crisscrossed the hilt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They reached an elevator shaft, one where the doors had been pried open to reveal the long channel that stretched impossibly far up and down, crossing kilometers of Iserlohn’s interior. Yang couldn’t help but wonder what the fall would feel like if someone turned Iserlohn’s gravity engines back on. Even though he had been floating through just as much of a shaft in the hallway, it was still much more disconcerting to pull himself into that chasm, and try to mentally reorient himself so that he was again swimming forward through the air above the ground, rather than ascending endlessly. When Yang hesitated, Ansbach pulled him forward by his elbow, and Yang got out of the way of the rest of the soldiers trying to swarm into the shaft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he looked down, he could see another group of their allies waiting a few floors down— another guard checkpoint, ready to provide support against any ambush. When he looked up, he couldn’t see much. They had several hundred floors to go, and the elevator shaft was unlit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This elevator would take them all the way towards Iserlohn’s bridge. Yang had no doubt that was where Muckenburger was. It might have been prudent for him to escape, for his own safety, but he wouldn’t do that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The group of soldiers moved together, Yang and Ansbach nearer to the rear of the pack. There was a sea of white-booted feet and legs kicking in front of him. People saved their fuel by dragging themselves along the walls with their hands, leaving their lower bodies to dangle in the air behind them. Even in those trained in zero gravity, there was a natural inclination to twitch and readjust, like they were in water rather than air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their helmets all had night vision mode, and they switched that on as soon as the light spilling in from the hallway became too dim to see by. Everything took on a red cast, and motions lagged dizzyingly in the helmet’s vision.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They climbed endlessly, moving more slowly than they had in the hallways. This wasn’t on any order of Flegel’s— the unshakeable subconscious feeling of climbing slowed them down. They were about halfway up the shaft, and the lookouts below had long vanished out of sight. But even if the lookouts had been in range, they wouldn’t have been able to stop a door in the middle of the shaft from opening, and the small explosive charge from being thrown “up” towards their group. No one in Flegel’s contingent saw it until it was far too late. Those at the rear of the group who had been watching their backs shot at it with their rifles— the shaft had been cleared of Zephyr particles already— but missed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was enough warning for everyone to scramble. Along with the rest of the soldiers, Yang pushed the throttle of his propulsion pack as hard as it would go, shooting “upwards” so quickly that his vision blacked out for a moment. He felt something heavy crash into him and force him sideways into the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach shoved Yang into a recess in the shaft— the slight indentation where the doors would open into the hallway. Yang didn’t have time to process what was going on, and his thumb stayed pressed to the acceleration button for his propulsion pack— the gas sprayed out uselessly behind him as his body remained jammed in the tiny indentation in the wall. Yang curled in on himself, knees tucked to his chest, and Ansbach was forced against him as the blast hit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even through his suit, Yang could feel the heat of the explosion, and the pressure was so great that it cracked the glass on the goggles of his helmet. His eyes were squeezed shut, but he could still see the bright flash of fire through his eyelids— the night vision on his helmet went pure, blinding white, then fried out, useless. The sound was so loud that it was immediately incomprehensible: his ears simply rang with a high buzzing tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the wave of fire passed over them, the walls and his suit stayed hot, and Yang’s first instinct was to try to claw his way out, shoving away Ansbach, who was in a similar useless state of momentary stupor. He pulled up his helmet so that he could at least see, which gave him back enough wherewithal to stop flailing uselessly, though the air burned his throat and dried his skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The elevator shaft was hopelessly dark, but Yang knew Iserlohn’s defenders were emerging from the doors below and beginning to ascend towards them. It was Yang’s turn to grab Ansbach’s arm and pull him into the center of the shaft. He was more dazed than Yang was, and didn’t resist. Yang engaged the propulsion pack on his back and dragged him upwards, through the crowd of soldiers— some living, some dead. The bomb had exploded “above” Yang, right in the center of the crowd. He pulled Ansbach through a cloud of gore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel, who had been at the very top of the column of soldiers, leading the charge, was also relatively unscathed. He had taken off his helmet, which revealed his wild expression, not helped by his stringy brown hair floating in every direction. His mouth moved, asking something, but Yang’s ears were still ringing, and the words were jumbled into nothing. Yang pointed with his free hand, up. That was the only direction they could go. He checked the number on the wall of the elevator shaft indicating their floor. Forty floors to go until they reached the level of Iserlohn’s command center. Without gravity, that was practically nothing at all. Less than two hundred meters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel yelled to the rest of the living contingent of soldiers, about half their original number, and those who could move did, pulling themselves upwards to escape the pursuers below. They had allies on the upper floors, those who had previously cleared the elevator shaft and were holding open the way to the bridge. They would have heard the explosion and would come to their aid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach came to his senses, and he pulled his arm out of Yang’s grip. From below, they were fired on with rifles, but the cloud of dead men in the corridor blocked most of the shots. The garrison force was still many floors below where Yang was, though they were ascending rapidly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door at the top of the shaft had been cut open, and light poured in. Yang could now hear the sounds of a fierce battle— his ears were recovering, though the rifle shots sounded farther away than they really were, echoey and distorted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang scrambled out of the elevator shaft with relief, though there was little of it to be had. Their allies were further down the hallway, a whole mass of them, shooting at what looked to be the last defenders of the bridge. Yang had never once been to this part of Iserlohn before: even to enter this floor had required authorization he had never had. Now, all of the doors were blown open, except for the ornate but solid ones that guarded the control room. The Zephyr particles had already been dispersed here, evidenced by the scorch marks all over the walls, as well as the use of rifles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There wasn’t much cover in the hallway, aside from that which was provided by the soldiers ahead of Yang. The fortress garrison was shooting at them from around a corner, but the door to the bridge was just before the hallway intersection, which meant that if they could withstand the fire long enough to open it, they would win.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since the shooting here was already in such close quarters, deploying a Zephyr particle canister in the hallway would be deadly for both sides. Yang didn’t doubt that someone would try it if they got too close to the door— soldiers could easily talk themselves into that kind of suicide. He hoped they wouldn’t: a second explosion would be deadly for him, as he had lost his helmet somewhere in the elevator shaft without thinking about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang pulled himself to the floor, trying to present as small a profile as he could. Rifle shots flashed above his head and hit the back wall of the elevator shaft, sparks pinging out where they landed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach took command of their rear line, and ordered several men to help him deal with the forces coming up the elevator shaft. He grabbed one of the dead soldiers who littered the hallway, one with a belt with canisters of Zephyr gas on it. Ansbach removed the belt, set the timed-release knob on one of the canisters, wedged it in the dead soldier’s rifle sling, and then pushed the body down the elevator shaft. The other soldiers pushed several more after it, orienting them so that it would look like they were a squad charging down. Everyone got out of the way of the brief pillar of fire that filled the elevator shaft a moment later as the soldiers below shot at the false charge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With the elevator shaft clear, Yang and his allies had a place to retreat to, so that they weren’t quite as exposed in the hallway. Once they took cover in the elevator shaft, it allowed them to throw a Zephyr particle canister down the hallway, towards the bridge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because the men near the bridge saw it coming, they stopped shooting, which meant that it became a battle of axes. The Iserlohn garrison forces rushed towards the elevator shaft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach shoved Yang out of the way again, forcing him to the rear of the line, and he could only watch and stay out of the way of the ensuing slaughter. It was impossible to tell who was winning at first, though at least it was possible to tell which side was which: Braunschweig’s forces who had been in the elevator shaft were blackened with scorch marks from previous explosions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>People tumbled over each other, an axe fight difficult on solid footing made even more confused without gravity. Each man seemed to find a counterpart to fight, occupying their own space in the elevator shaft and then hallway as they pushed the fight back towards the doors. It would have been like a ballet, if the air was not punctuated with the screech of metal-on-metal, and wounded men crying out in pain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s forces slowly gained the upper hand, aided by reinforcements coming up the elevator shaft from below. They pressed towards the doors to the bridge. When Yang’s group had arrived, their allies had already been in the process of opening the door, but had been ambushed while doing so— that was the firefight that Yang had stumbled into.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unlike all the others, this door needed to be opened with the computer control, since they had no desire to kill the men behind it who might surrender. They had cut open the wall and stuck an electronic lockpick into the mess of wires and circuits that controlled the heavy door. It fired commands into the lock, and sooner or later it would allow them to open the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>More and more of their invasion force rushed in to reinforce their position, and it gave Ansbach a chance to take stock of their situation, getting on the radio with the ships in the docking bays. The fight outside Iserlohn was still going on, and everywhere their soldiers were in the fortress, they were being resisted by the fortress garrison. It seemed that a majority of the garrison were now protecting the engines and computers in the fortress’s center, and that was where the fiercest battles were taking place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The electronic lockpick beeped success, and the heavy doors of Iserlohn’s bridge began to open. Yang was worried that there would be an immediate torrent of flame— someone in the bridge deciding they would rather be dead of Zephyr gas than captured— but nothing like that came. Instead, the invaders just charged in, axes in hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang couldn’t see what was going on from outside, but he did see Flegel enter into the melee, rushing through the door with the rest. Yang had no choice but to follow after him, wedging himself through the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time that Yang entered the control center of Iserlohn, the battle was almost over. Although the people in the control room had armed themselves with axes, these were not ground troops used to fighting— they were specialists manning Iserlohn’s many operational systems. Only a few of them had put on armor from the emergency caches under the floors, and most of them were holding their hands up in surrender, pushed against the walls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Yang saw this, he was hopeful that Muckenburger had already surrendered, but as Yang scanned the room, his eyes finally moving up towards the ceiling, it was clear that this was not the case.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel had claimed Muckenburger as his own prize.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger was being held in place in the air by two of Braunschweig’s soldiers. They had been careful not to injure him, as he wasn’t bleeding. Despite the fact that his arms were wrenched behind his back, Muckenburger still held himself with a stoic grace, watching Flegel as he jetted back and forth in front of him, flitting around with his propulsion pack. Muckenburger wasn’t wearing armor, and so his cape, where it wasn’t pinned by the soldiers holding him, drifted in the air behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone scattered throughout the room watched the scene.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s good to see you again, Fleet Admiral,” Flegel said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe so,” Muckenburger replied. His voice was calm, and even lacked any tone of resignation. It carried clearly through the bridge— the habit of projection from a lifetime in command.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The circumstances could be better.” Flegel’s voice was needling, and Yang could barely hear him. “But that doesn’t mean this can’t be a happy moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger said nothing. Yang started to push off the floor, to go up to join Flegel and try to negotiate, but Ansbach grabbed him by the scruff of his armor and held him down. Muckenburger saw the motion out of the corner of his eye and looked down at Yang. Their eyes met. Muckenburger’s expression didn’t change, and then he looked away, back up at Flegel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you tell your men to unhand me?” Muckenburger asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Flegel said. “We can have this conversation like civilized men.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two soldiers holding Muckenburger let him go, and moved back. Yang shivered— already, a feeling of doom was settling on his shoulders, creeping down his back. Ansbach let Yang go, then silently pushed off the floor to go join Flegel, drifting near him in the air. Flegel didn’t acknowledge him at all, aside from a glance. Yang had gotten the hint and didn’t approach, but did move a little closer, better able to see Muckenburger’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have a different understanding of that word,” Muckenburger said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do we?” Flegel’s smile was wide. “I serve the Kaiserin, and I believe you served her grandfather for your entire career. Don’t we have that in common?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t believe so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t tell me that you won’t swear loyalty to the Empire’s rightful ruler,” Flegel said. “It would be for all our benefits if—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no interest in bowing to the queen of a damned country,” Muckenburger said, cutting Flegel off. “And I have no interest in benefiting the ones who have done the damning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger was no longer looking at Flegel; he was looking at Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Flegel said. The faux humor had fallen out of his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I congratulate you on your talent. I do not believe there is any other who could have taken this fortress by force.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, on behalf of my uncle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger continued as though Flegel had said nothing. “No other man could have destroyed this nation so easily.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you’re mistaken,” Flegel said. “We’re restoring it to its correct state.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This, Muckenburger responded to directly, with a sweep of his arm that made Ansbach twitch. “And your Kaiserin will rule over the rebel invasion, since Iserlohn can no longer be the Empire’s bulwark against it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You believe the Imperial Fleet isn’t capable of resisting that on its own? Without this toy?” Flegel asked. “I always thought you were proud of the ship you ran.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger scanned the room again. His eyes settled on Yang once more. “I’ve always been a conservative man, Baron Flegel,” Muckenburger said. “If you do not understand the true value of Iserlohn— the reason why it was an effective tool— you do not understand what this war looked like before it was built.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enlighten me, then. I’m not a student of history, particularly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before the Thor Hammer, every encounter with the rebel fleet cost ten times the number of lives, and those encounters were constant. Iserlohn not only discouraged the rebels from attacking, but every shot of the Thor Hammer spared days of combat. Iserlohn represents— represented— thirty million fathers who lived to have sons. I don’t know how many men’s lives its destruction will represent, but that clock starts counting now, and it will go on until this Empire no longer exists. The rebels will never allow another Iserlohn to be built.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He paused, but when Flegel said nothing, Muckenburger continued. “I have no doubt that the Imperial Fleet can stave off invasions when they come. At least for some time.” A strange, grim smile crossed his face. “You’re correct that I am proud of the fleet. I think they’re capable of that much. But is your leadership capable of withstanding the cost of sacrificing millions to the pyre?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think it will come to—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You and I both believe we’re serving the people of the Empire,” Muckenburger said, “but you have done them the greatest disservice in the history of this nation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It can be fixed,” Flegel said dismissively. “You say that you’re proud of the fleet, but you act like without you it’s incapable of holding the corridor for long enough to do repair work.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger was silent for a moment. “The idea that Iserlohn was impenetrable was just as valuable of a deterrent as the Thor Hammer itself,” he said. “That can never be regained.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re talking like a religious man,” Flegel said. “The force that our fleet represents is plenty, since it actually will turn the rebels away— if they come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then join us,” Flegel said. “I’m quite happy to accept your surrender, on behalf of my uncle and my cousin the Kaiserin. If you believe the Empire is in so much danger, you should work with us to protect it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Muckenburger said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My uncle respects your years of service— I’m sure a position fitting to your talents could be found for you.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger didn’t take his eyes off Yang, who was struck by a sudden memory—completely incongruous—of Reuenthal. The setting could not have been more different: the ruins of Iserlohn and the empty dorm rooms of the Imperial Officers Academy. But the light in Muckenburger’s eyes was the same.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am not interested in surrendering,” Muckenburger said. He briefly closed his eyes in thought, then opened them again. “Elizabeth will take the crown. I have no doubt about that. So this will be treason, and you’ll kill me for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh come now, Fleet Admiral—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s heartbeat sounded in his ears, drowning out Flegel’s voice as he needled Muckenburger. Flegel knew as well as anybody else that Muckenburger wouldn’t bow, but he was enjoying the momentary sense of power, drawing out the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that the battle was lost, refusing to bow could no longer truly be a matter of conscience—if Muckenburger wanted to protect the Empire from the Alliance, and from Yang, he should stay alive to do so. Flegel was right about that, at least. But it was not a matter of conscience anymore: it was a matter of pride.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He might have bowed to Yang. This was what Muckenburger’s eyes, fixed on him, seemed to say. If this was a different world, if Yang was a different man. But in this world, all Yang could do was plead silently, his mouth half open, locking eyes with him. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Stay alive</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Yang thought. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Stay alive, stay alive—it’s better to stay alive— bow, do what he says, it doesn’t matter—just stay alive—</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>His throat was too tight. Even if he had wanted to yell out to Muckenburger, he doubted he could get out the words. And it wouldn’t matter, even if he did. He knew that the last argument Muckenburger would listen to was that Yang wanted him to live simply for the sake of living. That was an idea incompatible with his pride— his existence as a soldier, his idea of himself. Yang understood that all too well— he had loved that quality in better days, in a different man. The ache he felt now was an echo of that: the pain of thwarted compassion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang hated proud men. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach leaned over to Flegel and said something to him, too quiet for Yang to hear. Flegel held up his hand in dismissal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My uncle will be quite displeased to hear that you won’t accept our generous offer,” Flegel said. He wrinkled his nose. “Despite us having control of the fortress, you won’t tell the fleet to stand down?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muckenburger was silent. Yang doubted he would say anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel waited for just a moment too long. Stretching out the silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll be tried,” he said. “For treason. We’ll make a court for you. Set an example.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if that’s your choice. But you’ll have plenty of time to think about it— my uncle and my cousin will be very happy if you change your mind before then. The Empire can always use experienced people such as yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel gestured to the soldiers who had been waiting off in the distance to take hold of Muckenburger again. As they approached, Muckenburger reached behind himself, faster than anyone had expected, and drew out his sidearm, pointing it at Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach dived into the path of the gun, then a fraction of a second later realized the mistake he had made and corrected course to reach for the gun itself. Muckenburger’s finger twitched on the trigger, but he didn’t fire, and a strange smile crossed his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel was slower to react, but did so without thinking at all. By the time Ansbach had ripped the gun from Muckenburger’s hand, the ornate knife that had been in Flegel’s hand all day was lodged in Muckenburger’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The blood sprayed out violently, unconstrained by gravity, and even a proud man like Muckenburger died thrashing and gurgling. Ansbach was gripping his right arm with enough strength to break a bone, but Muckenburger’s left hand clawed at the knife in his throat, trying vainly to remove it. No one else on the bridge moved a muscle, watching him struggle until his movements— erratic from the first moment— became weaker and slower, until his eyes went dim and his body limp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Muckenburger was dead, Flegel pulled the knife from his throat. He wiped it on Muckenburger’s shirt, then put it back in its sheath at his side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach let go of the body and held out Muckenburger’s sidearm to Flegel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t he fire?” Flegel asked, clearly not having yet processed everything that had happened. His hand, reaching for the gun, was bloody. “Isn’t this whole room filled with Zephyr gas?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, sir,” Ansbach lied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel took the gun and hefted it, then looked around for the first time. He held out the gun like he was going to shoot it. Ansbach stiffened, but didn’t move. Flegel spun around in the air, pointing the gun in a wild circle, until he froze at the same angle that Muckenburger had been facing, the gun pointed directly at Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel’s expression changed as he played over the previous few moments again in his memory— he was a man who wore his thoughts on his face. He looked at Ansbach, who looked straight ahead of himself with a blank expression, and narrowed his eyes.</span>

  <em>
    <span>February 489 I.C., Phezzan</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Years ago, if anyone had asked Commander Neidhardt Muller if he would miss any of the cast of characters who rotated in and out of the Alliance embassy on Phezzan, he would have laughed and said that his posting on Phezzan was interesting for the weather, and the entertainment, and the liberated Phezzani women— not for whatever the Alliance was doing. Even now, he still would have said that line, and did: it was a useful reply to have on hand when someone at a party asked him what he enjoyed about his posting on Phezzan, and if he ever intended to go back home, and what he thought about his counterparts from the other side of the galaxy. His time on Phezzan had taught him a lot of things, and telling charming lies at a party was one of the first lessons he learned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The trouble was that he did miss Reinhard von Müsel, who had left his post at the Alliance embassy well over a year beforehand. Not that they had been particular friends— their relationship, such as it was, was contentious even at the best of times— but Müsel had been a source of information, and entertaining besides that. There was a part of Muller that wondered if Müsel missed him just as much, doing whatever it was he was doing over in the Alliance. He doubted it, but it was fun to wonder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller had tried his best to keep track of what had become of Müsel. He had been dismissed from Phezzan to attend some kind of inquiry on Heinessen, which had to do with the Castrop affair, and, Muller suspected, Müsel’s willingness to allow Imperial prisoners to walk free on his request. That was all Muller had learned about it— the actual proceedings were the kind of secrets that didn’t make their way to Phezzan’s Imperial embassy, and it wasn’t like Müsel was going to write him to say how it all turned out. After that, from going over crew posting lists with a fine tooth comb, Muller determined that he had been sent to the front. From there, Müsel vanished from his radar almost completely. This wasn’t unusual, but it did make him a little wistful, not knowing what the man was up to. At least he knew that he was still alive out there— his pseudonymous blog still updated about once every month and a half. This was far less frequently than it had in the past, and it contained even less personal information than it used to, but the posts still read like Müsel was trying out concepts for a doctoral thesis, and Muller still read them all, cheap Phezzani beer in hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like so many other things in Muller’s life, the blog posts from “Marian Evans” seemed to exist in a bubble where nothing had yet gone wrong, and Muller was standing inside that bubble, watching everything tumble down around him. Somehow, ever since the Kaiser’s death, Müsel had managed to avoid talking about the complete economic chaos that was sweeping the galaxy, despite half the comments on his posts asking for his (or her, since his writer persona was a woman) thoughts on the matter. (Muller doubted that Müsel looked at his Phezzani comment section at all, which was one of the only things that stopped him from leaving his own remarks.) It was deeply strange that Müsel refused to talk about it, since even among the economically disinterested— which comprised most of the Imperial Embassy staff on Phezzan— it was a topic of conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Kaiser Friedrich died without a clear successor, things in the Empire had ground to an almost complete standstill. At first, it hadn’t been too bad— there was an influx of immigration to Phezzan, most of it “temporary”, as many members of the upper class who didn’t want to be around for civil war found a place to escape to. They brought their assets with them, and froze what they couldn’t carry. Nobles who remained began to take on a personally isolationist policy— keeping whatever their lands produced, rather than trying to sell. That was one thing, Muller thought, that was positive about the feudal system— each planet could be self sustaining for quite some time, and the lives of the peasants wouldn’t change much. The Empire’s steady flow of trade began to fall apart, with the remaining Imperial government unable to control its movement (and certainly unable to tax it). What remained was essentially a black market between individual planets and families, those allied to each other sharing resources. But these tenuous supply lines were vulnerable, and also inaccessible to Phezzan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phezzan had a great deal of its own economy tied up in the Empire— a lot in trade, but a not-insignificant amount of it in the form of loans, which abruptly stopped returning interest as no one in the Empire could pay them. In normal years, Phezzan also functioned as a kind of clearing house for Imperial goods— importing from noble families, either raw materials or finished products, and then re-selling them within the Empire. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The merchant class of the Empire had almost completely been absorbed into Phezzan’s economy. This was something that Müsel </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> written about extensively on his blog, many years before, and Muller called the memory of it to mind when thinking about the current situation. With such a sharp divide between nobility and peasantry, the middle class of the Empire was small, and social mobility was limited. The educated middle class tended to be concentrated in urban areas, primarily on Odin, and almost exclusively functioned as a quasi-artisan class, with work often tied to specific noble families. The only form of class mobility was through the Fleet, and even that was highly restrictive. Those who managed to gather the wealth to form part of a mercantile class were welcomed with open arms by Phezzan, while they had no way to move forward into the upper echelons of Imperial society. Over time, it had become somewhat self defeating— with no existing social structure to support a merchant fleet, all business went through Phezzan, which further reduced the space available for tradesmen to become merchants. This system had calcified within two generations of the settlement of Phezzan, and no one in the Empire had cared enough to put policies in place to change it. That, too, was a combination of factors: the nobility had reason to protect their class position within the Empire, and Phezzan had reason to discourage the Empire from working to loosen their near-stranglehold on Imperial goods.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Müsel, in his writing, had described the system with nothing but contempt, Muller thought that it seemed to work well, at least up until this point. After all, even if it gave Phezzan power over the Empire, the reason they had that power was the same reason that they were compelled not to exercise it: their economic fortunes were completely tied together. And Muller could certainly understand what the appeal was for every individual involved, beyond the rational calculations of money moving through the galaxy— there was a reason he enjoyed his post on Phezzan so much. Not having a ‘von’ in his name meant less on Phezzan than it did in almost any other officer’s posting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller’s father was a member of the tiny educated middle class— a doctor. He had encouraged him as a child to find some livelihood that would keep him equally well fed, and Muller had been talented enough to earn a seat at the IOA. He sometimes wondered what he would have done if he hadn’t scored well on the entrance exam— would he have ended up on Phezzan after all, only as someone working in the offices of one of their conglomerates? He didn’t know. It was very funny to picture himself as a salaryman— like he had been amused several years ago watching Müsel put on a suit and fake glasses to attend all his interviews with Phezzani mining companies.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As far as the Alliance’s economy went, they were just as invested in Phezzan as the Empire was, if in a different way. It was funny how closely the two sides of the galaxy was tied together, considering the Empire and the Alliance were permanent enemies, and had been at war for well over a hundred years. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Phezzani currency, called charges, was a smoke and mirrors way for Phezzan to use the real value that they siphoned off of the Empire’s trade as a lever in the Alliance economy. When Imperial goods were passed through Phezzan, though the business between parties was usually conducted in Reichsmarks, Phezzan extracted a sales tax. Phezzan used this extracted value from the Empire’s economy as a backing for issuing its own currency. In the early days of Phezzan’s trade with the Alliance, they had used their currency to offer loans to the Alliance. They fully expected the loans to never be repaid, but gave compelling interest rates for interest paid in the Alliance dinar. Slowly, this allowed them to stockpile Alliance currency as well, and made the planet a way to exchange currencies between the two nations. And Phezzan never hesitated to profit off of that, either.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Alliance’s internal economy was significantly more robust and complex than that of the Empire, but much less stable. Unlike the Empire, which by its feudal nature was slow growing at best, the Alliance prized growth in everything— physical expansion, population, standards of living, any metric they could think of to measure. But any gains they could eke out were in direct competition with the fact that their economy was shackled to the endless needs of war production. The government’s search for revenue to fund the army squeezed every other sector, and left private businesses reliant on regular injections of Phezzani cash, which floated around the Alliance as a ghostly alternative currency. Phezzan was also quite happy to provide things of real value: Imperial goods that churned through Phezzan’s system, all their serial numbers filed off. Much like anyone who set foot on Phezzan could become an anonymous “Phezzani citizen” if they wished, so too could wheat and cloth and circuit boards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Phezzan grew richer, they had not shied away from running real businesses, ones that produced something, within the Alliance or Empire. These were the giant conglomerates that did so much business on the planet. But the more complicated and “real” Phezzan’s economy grew, the more the Phezzani government had license to perform economic manipulations that no one outside their government could keep track of. Phezzan could issue as much currency as it wanted, and so long as the galaxy’s economy continued to chug along, no one would mind if what backed Phezzan’s currency was mostly faith.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In any event, the disaster of the civil war had knocked life out of balance. With the sudden cessation of most Imperial trade, the faith that underpinned Phezzan’s ability to function was shaken. Phezzani businesses were now desperate to sell all their physical goods, and could no longer do so in the Empire, so a huge number of additional goods were being flushed into the Alliance’s markets. Although this only represented a fairly small real percentage increase, it caused a shockwave in the prices of domestic goods, outcompeted by suddenly-cheap Phezzani products. Simultaneously, Phezzan hiked interest rates on their loans to try to cushion the loss of revenue from the Empire. With the sudden deflation in prices, Alliance businesses found their profits falling short, and they were unable to service their existing loans. Those that were critical to the economy leaned on the Alliance government for support, while those that were non-essential began to go under one at a time. The situation would have to level out eventually, but to Muller it looked like it was going to keep getting worse for a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On Phezzan, life went on, but what he read in the Alliance papers about the situation made Muller wince. He could understand why Phezzan was acting in such a self-interested way, but it seemed shortsighted at best. If the Alliance grew wary of Phezzan’s power over their economy— and from the howling of the pundits in the papers, it seemed like more and more were coming to that conclusion— Phezzan could find itself cut off from that side. If the Alliance recovered from this stumble, they wouldn’t immediately reinvest in Phezzan, and if the Imperial civil war dragged on—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, Muller didn’t want to think about that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>News that reached Phezzan about what was going on in the Empire was all shoddy. They had contact with “a government” on Odin— Littenheim had taken over the capital— but everyone could see that its position was tenuous at best. Lichtenlade, whom everyone at the embassy considered to still be the actual head of government, was in hiding. Most of their real instructions, such as they were, came from Fleet Admiral Muckenburger on Iserlohn, functioning as a kind of government-in-exile. But all Muckenburger cared about was their ongoing information gathering on the Alliance, to see if there was any preparation for an invasion through Iserlohn while the Empire was weak. Muller and his coworkers dutifully reported what they could. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aside from that, they were helpless to do anything, even if they had wanted to. They couldn’t halt the trickle of refugees through the corridor, even those that were bringing along military secrets or other things of value in hope of securing a favorable spot within the Alliance. As a tiny diplomatic outpost that served a country that had functionally ceased to exist, they had little power. But Muller still showed up to work each day, gritting his teeth and smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phezzanis wanted everyone in the Embassy to pretend that life was going on as usual. Everyone on the planet was blissfully fiddling while the galaxy burned, it seemed like to Muller. Perhaps that was an illusion, and within the corporate boardrooms and bedrooms of CEOs there was just as much anxiety as he felt, but if there was, it was all taking place far from his line of sight. Instead, invitations were still regularly extended to the members of the Embassy, and it was Muller’s duty to attend. He sometimes wanted to shriek, thinking about what was going on at home, while sipping martinis at some party.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He should have been glad to not be in the thick of it— after all, if he had been assigned to some other section of the fleet, he would have been obliged to fight against his own countrymen, but instead he just felt a gnawing uselessness. That was one other thing he missed Reinhard von Müsel for— if Müsel had been around, surely he would have told Muller to stop being ridiculous, even if doing so would have caused Muller to amp up his efforts to spy on him, in particular. Somehow, that man had a way of injecting other people with a kind of purpose. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller was at one of these miserable parties now, on a yacht in the river. The boat was moving so slowly that other ship traffic had to swerve around it to pass, but as the sun set the other traffic mostly disappeared, leaving the only sounds the music of the band further up the deck, and the lapping of the water on the side of the boat, and the distant hum of city noise. Muller wasn’t in uniform— this wasn’t that kind of party— and he was the only member of the Embassy who had come. Muller had, unfortunately or fortunately, become the designated invitee to all of these events. He was young and handsome and an interesting conversationalist, and not quite as cold-bloodedly Imperial as his superiors. Muller could never really decide if that was a good thing about himself or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t know what this party was ostensibly celebrating, and the only people here were Phezzanis, aside from himself. The Alliance embassy, caving to the popular sentiment in their homeland, had begun to boycott all the usual Imperial events. Muller didn’t mind not seeing them around— none of their current crop of staff was particularly interesting, and none of them were stupid enough to say anything at a party that Muller could use. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had spent the dinner before boarding the yacht socializing with the other guests, but now Muller found he had no one he wanted to talk to, and was leaning over the rail on the aft of the yacht, watching the churn of the water from the slow-moving propeller. He had a whiskey in his hand, and while the sun had just gone down, the sky was still a dusty red on the horizon. The yacht’s fairy lights twinkled above his head, and he stared into space, thinking idly, once again, of how his parents were doing on Odin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He should be more dutiful, he chided himself, but he didn’t want to go up towards the main deck of the boat, where the dancing was. The back of the ship was secluded, and looking out at the city lights was peaceful, in its own way. Phezzan wanted to pretend like life was still going on; well, the lights there were proof that somewhere, at least, it did. A self-fulfilling prophecy, maybe, but then again, what else was Phezzan?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not enjoying yourself at my party, Commander Muller?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was so startled to hear the sonorous voice behind him that he almost dropped his drink over the railing. He straightened up and turned around. Landressher Rubinsky, whom Muller had only ever spoken to once before, had come down the stairs to the empty bottom section of the deck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have an excellent memory, sir,” Muller said. Although Rubinsky had spoken in the Imperial language, Muller responded in the Phezzani patois— not for any real reason, other than that it had become second nature to him after so long at his post. “I’m not even in uniform— I’m not sure how you know me from any man on the street.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Haven’t you attended almost every one of my little events for years?” Rubinsky asked, remaining resolutely in the Imperial language. “I’m nothing if not good with faces. It comes with the territory.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s true that I’m the embassy’s designated guest, unless my superiors are specifically summoned,” Muller said. “I assume it’s because whichever secretary of yours sends invites thinks I’m handsome.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubinsky laughed. Muller looked behind him inconspicuously, trying to see where his usual cadre of security had gone. They were nowhere in sight, but that didn’t mean much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We would be a poor Imperial territory if we didn’t extend invitations to someone from your party,” Rubinsky said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And that’s why you invite the Alliance, as well?” He smiled, making it clear that the remark was meant only as a joke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t see the rebels here today,” Rubinsky said, gesturing broadly at the fore of the boat behind them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. It makes me feel a little unbalanced, to not have something to counteract. I’m useless without an enemy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not enemies while you’re both my guests.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I always did like that line,” Muller said. “The way everyone here pretends to live in a better world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you drunk, Commander?” Rubinsky didn’t sound accusatory, merely curious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller looked down at the glass in his hand— still mostly full. “No. You’ll have to pardon me for speaking out of turn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No pardon required at all,” Rubinsky said. “I’m just surprised you have an opinion like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I like Phezzan,” Muller said. He could have elaborated, but didn’t. Rubinsky was, after all, not a trustworthy person. One didn’t become the leader of Phezzan through honesty and fair play.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re one of very few who hold that opinion,” Rubinsky said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More’s the pity.” Muller leaned on the railing, looking out over the darkening water. The yacht had turned a bend in the river, and now directly behind the boat, the spire of the elevator rose up into the sky, still lit by traces of the sun, like a signal flare that kept burning. “I’ll miss it here when I’m reassigned.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And are you expecting that to happen anytime soon?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herr Rubinsky, if you’re asking for information, I’m afraid I know as little about how things are gong on my side of the galaxy as you do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I was merely curious about staff changes at the Embassy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller smiled, but this time it was uncomfortably tight. “Phezzan is a country of the status quo,” he said. “Unfortunately, the rest of the universe is not. That’s the only thing I know about the future.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure that’s true,” Rubinsky said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In what way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There isn’t a single creature in the universe who can survive without being able to adapt. Those are the laws of nature— and governments, and businesses. They hold for Phezzan, just as much as they hold for the Empire, or for the rebels.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller was silent for a moment. “Phezzan’s certainly been forcing the Alliance to adapt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not my doing, I assure you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All this government does is issue currency,” Rubinsky said, which was such a vast and laughable oversimplification that Muller had to make an effort to control his facial expressions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And couldn’t you, as a currency-issuing body, have offered to prop up Phezzani firms that were hurting from the loss of Imperial business, rather than letting them hunt down their debtors and crash the Alliance economy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubinsky smiled, but didn’t answer the question. “It’s interesting that a representative of the Imperial government is so concerned with that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s my job to care about the Alliance. Besides, if the Alliance learns to live without you, Phezzan will be in a worse position,” Muller said. “And as I said, I happen to like Phezzan.” He looked down into his drink. “Maybe for my own reasons, but nevertheless…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The rebels will find it very difficult to live without us,” Rubinsky said, dismissing the comment. “A wholly insular economy is one that will tear itself apart sooner, rather than later. Like you said, Commander— one needs someone to compete against. A matching pair.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That might be true,” Muller said. “But I don’t know if Phezzan will survive long enough to benefit—” He realized that he was saying far too much. “Forgive me, sir. I don’t mean to overstep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Words are words,” Rubinsky said. “I’ve never really found much need to take them to heart— I’d rather have money than promises of love.” He paused. “And maybe you’re right. I have no idea what the rebels are planning to do, if it doesn’t involve us. Maybe we’ve made them accidentally unpredictable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe, sir,” Muller said. He couldn’t interpret Rubinsky’s comment— was it meant to be a warning. “You think they’re a poked tiger?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubinsky smiled. “What do you think, Commander?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not like the Alliance has exactly been a tame housecat before now. But other than that, I couldn’t say, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubinsky stared at him for a moment, then said, “They send you here because you’re the least cowed of all the people in that embassy— you should use that to your advantage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure what advantage you expect me to gain, sir,” Muller said. “Nor which ones you think I should want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubinsky cocked an eyebrow. “Every man has something he wants.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And are you here to offer me something?” Muller asked. He sipped his drink, then laughed a little. “Sir, I’m eating better at this party than I have in weeks— the Embassy ran out of money for payroll, and I’ve been eating nothing but canned beans to stretch my last paycheck. There’s not much I can trade you, even if I wanted to. The Embassy is functionally the last outpost of a ruined country, until someone manages to pick up the pieces.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re too honest. And I wasn’t looking for anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just in case— it’s better to head you off at the pass,” Muller said. “You sounded like you forgot that the reason I have this post in the first place, and why I’ve been here so long, is that I’m a loyal servant of the Imperial government. Whoever’s government it ends up being.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have a stake in the civil war?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller smiled. “I don’t have a noble name. Even if I had an opinion, it wouldn’t matter much.” He </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> a good liar, when he needed to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And besides— there’s no war here on Phezzan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubinsky smiled too, though his smile was tight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was there something you wanted, sir?” Muller asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no— I just wanted to get the thoughts of someone closer to the situation in the Empire than I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re the same distance away,” Muller said. “Here in the center of the galaxy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re a flatterer to my country.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s my job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s a fickle mistress to flatter, so I’m told,” Rubinsky said. “Of all the people who come here looking for her favor, she gives it to very few.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, for those who have it, that makes her the best kind of mistress, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A woman’s voice sounded from atop the deck behind them. “Adrian?” she called. “Are you busy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubinsky glanced up behind himself, looking over at the red-haired woman— Dominique Saint-Pierre— and waved his hand at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t mean to distract you from your much more important guests,” Muller said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hardly. Perhaps I’ll see you again, Herr Muller,” Rubinsky said. “Enjoy the party.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will, thank you, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubinsky walked away. Muller realized, playing the conversation over in his head, that he had stayed in the Phezzani patois, and Rubinsky had stayed in Imperial the entire time. It felt strange to him, though he couldn’t explain why— didn’t understand the point Rubinsky had been trying to make. Muller wasn’t intending to be deferent to Phezzan, and he doubted Rubinsky had any reason to flatter him, a relatively lowly soldier. It buzzed around his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hadn’t gotten much information about the Alliance, either. It all seemed very ominous— that was the only thing he knew for sure. He dumped the rest of his whiskey over the side of the boat, watched it disappear into the churning water, and went to go mingle with the guests some more. He wouldn’t learn anything from them, either, but he wanted to try.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the boat finally docked, around three in the morning, and all the other guests stumbled drunkenly off into their limousines, Muller took a bus back to the embassy building. Aside from the guards, he was the only one in the offices. It was creaky and quiet in the old marble building, with just the humming of computers and the whirr of the HVACs kicking on and off. The lights were off in the main office floor, and Muller went directly to his own tiny office, and woke up his computer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although he addressed the message he was sending to Fleet Admiral Muckenburger in Iserlohn, he knew well enough that Commodore Hank von Leigh would read the message eventually, when he gained access to Iserlohn’s computer systems. Leigh’s plans were obvious to anyone who had been paying attention, and Muller had been sufficiently convinced by the Castrop affair that Leigh could— and would— take Iserlohn. And Leigh was someone Muller knew how to write to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Muller finished writing his letter— a long one, detailing the current state of the Alliance and Phezzan, the disrupted status quo, the way the Alliance was being pushed to the breaking point, and Rubinsky’s strange curiosity— by six-thirty in the morning, finished reading it over and pressed send by six-forty-five. He was in the process of writing a note for his superior, describing the communique with Iserlohn (and telling him that he would be taking the morning off to have a nap) at seven. At three minutes after seven, an urgent message from the Iserlohn fleet arrived in the Embassy’s secure ansible system. It was marked with so many bright red urgent flags that Muller stopped everything that he was doing to read it, and he was therefore the first to know what had happened on the other side of the galaxy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Iserlohn fortress had been captured, and the Embassy’s new orders were, regardless of cost, to kill any member of Duke Braunschweig’s family if they attempted to enter Phezzan.</span>

  <em>
    <span>February 489 I.C., Iserlohn Fortress</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer had never been more struck by the difference between himself and Yang Wen-li than he was while watching the fall of Iserlohn Fortress. Mittermeyer’s ships were responsible for keeping the pace of the battle, but Yang was charged with </span>
  <em>
    <span>winning</span>
  </em>
  <span>— which seemed like something only he was capable of doing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer’s scout ships, at the outside edge of his fleet, could see around the side of Iserlohn. Despite the communications blockage, they could report what Yang’s fleet was doing, and they sent Mittermeyer a video feed, which he watched with one eye as he directed the movements of his ships with the other. When he saw the missiles rushing towards the Thor Hammer, he almost didn’t pay attention until the first few hit, and then he lost focus on what he was saying to his aide as the rest impacted the fortress’s shell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was well aware of the Thor Hammer’s destructive power: his own fleet had been baiting out its blows and staying just outside its effective range. Even at a distance, it was terrifying. It had felt like an insurmountable obstacle, a force of nature. And yet, there it was, being hit with one bright flash of missile-fire at a time, until the whole thing collapsed in on itself. It had the death-throes of an animal, a giant taken down by a pebble in its eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took Mittermeyer a moment to remember that Yang was his friend, to try to connect this vision of Yang, with the power of life and death wholly in his hands, to the gentle and quiet man he knew. He struggled to resolve the image in his mind, and the resolution came only when he realized why he felt such horror at the gaping hole in Iserlohn’s side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer, now fighting the fortress fleet, recognized the ships that flew by: he could name many of their captains and crews, all the men he had worked with for months. He knew the staff inside Iserlohn, as comrades, if not friends. The fear he felt watching Iserlohn’s walls tumble down was not just awe at Yang’s skill. He wondered if, even if he had been as brilliant as Yang, if he would have been able to strike that final blow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang felt the same amount of pity for Alliance soldiers as he did for any member of the Imperial forces in Iserlohn— perhaps because he had been born on Heinessen, but Mittermeyer suspected that if they ventured out of this galaxy and found a race of aliens to war with, Yang would open his heart to the inhuman, too. It was a positive quality of his, and on some level Mittermeyer felt ashamed for lacking his indiscriminate compassion, but it also meant that Yang had as little hesitation attacking Iserlohn as he would attacking anywhere else— his universal tenderness paradoxically making him feel more brutal here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even after the Thor Hammer had been destroyed and the fortress rendered impotent, the fortress fleet fought with all its strength to keep Mittermeyer’s slow crew transports from making their way in. This was fine. He corralled the Iserlohn fleet to stop them from attacking Braunschweig’s landing party. Whatever contingent of landing forces Braunschweig had on his side, he would be able to use them to force a surrender, so Mittermeyer didn’t press as hard as he could to get his landing forces down. The battle was won— it was just a matter of not wasting lives until Iserlohn acknowledged it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Many hours passed, and Mittermeyer only got occasional updates on the number of ships that had landed inside the fortress. It was hard to tell how things were going inside, but there were no obvious signs that things were going badly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The situation only changed when finally, finally, the communications blockage that Iserlohn had been imposing dropped, and their radios picked up a message from the fortress itself. It was Yang’s voice. Although he sounded miserable even over the radio, Mittermeyer couldn’t help but feel elated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Iserlohn Fortress Fleet,” Yang said, “Fleet Admiral Muckenburger is dead, and Iserlohn has been captured. Surrender now and you will be treated—” Yang’s voice was strained, and he audibly stumbled. “You will be treated with mercy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if they don’t surrender?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer hadn’t realized that the leader of Cahokia’s ground forces had come up behind him on the bridge to listen to the announcement, and he was startled to hear his voice. When he had arrived at Cahokia, he had been surprised to find that he actually knew the man from years ago. They had been former schoolmates, though they had fallen out of contact after they left the IOA. That time was so long ago that it felt like a dream, but they had played their student wargames together. This was undoubtedly why Captain Ferner had been given the position as leader of Cahokia’s ground forces, and why he now had a perhaps unwarranted sense of familiarity towards Mittermeyer— he spoke his mind without considering if he wanted to hear it or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’ll surrender,” Mittermeyer said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know why you’re sure of that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re defeated— there’s not much else they could do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why hasn’t Commodore von Leigh radioed us with instructions?” Ferner asked. “He’s perfectly capable of doing so, since we’re receiving what he’s broadcasting to the Iserlohn fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He understood what Ferner was implying— Yang wanted him to do something that he could not order, and simply trusted him to do. The only thing that was in that category was allowing the Iserlohn fleet to escape. If Braunschweig was giving orders, he would order their destruction if no surrender was forthcoming. Ferner, who had played on Yang’s team for the war games many years ago, was well aware of his merciful tendencies.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer pressed his lips into a thin, annoyed line, then said, “He doesn’t have the authority to issue orders. I’m sure he’s waiting on Duke Braunschweig, or Admiral Merkatz.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Prepare our forces to land inside,” Mittermeyer said. “It sounds like there’s still resistance that we’ll have to deal with.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer turned back towards his console, and Ferner walked away, though he could feel his occasional glances back at him. For the fleet, there was only one thing left to do, which was to enter Iserlohn. It would serve the dual purpose of getting their ground troops inside, and giving Yang what he wanted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He ordered his fleet to take up a spear formation and break through the fortress fleet’s remaining defenses. After such a prolonged back and forth and the confusion that Yang’s message had caused, the fleet was already in disarray, so this was the perfect moment to strike. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He baited them forwards and then back, just like they had been doing for hours, then ordered his fleet to break through as the fortress fleet pulled back from their false retreat. The new rush, much more powerful and deliberate than any of Mittermeyer’s previous attacks, caught the fortress fleet off guard, and they broke through easily. His heavily armored battleships then broke off on either side and circled back around the bulk of the fleet to protect the weaker crew transports.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Iserlohn fleet attempted to attack Mittermeyer now that his battleships were bunched up near the outside of Iserlohn; they were sitting targets until all of them had gotten inside the liquid metal walls. As the fleet charged, the remaining bulk of Braunschweig’s forces came around the side of the fortress to provide support, and it became clear that the battle was lost for the Iserlohn fleet. When Braunschweig’s fleet charged, they had no choice but to flee. Braunschweig’s fleet chased them, but Mittermeyer suspected that they wouldn’t pursue very far. There was nothing to be gained from killing the fortress fleet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The battle moving away from the fortress meant that there was an eerie kind of peace as his forces descended. It was punctuated by radio contact with the command center of Iserlohn, finally getting a report on what the status of the fortress itself was. Although the command center was fully under the duke’s control, there was heavy resistance in almost every other area, especially near the engines. There were fires in the greenhouses, along with other acts of sabotage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ground troops that had been on Cahokia were greater in number than the Iserlohn garrison, and although the garrison had the advantage of familiarity, Mittermeyer still felt confident in sending Ferner and his men to deal with the issues. Over the radio, Braunschweig ordered them to kill anyone who resisted. He seemed irate at the fact that the fortress garrison still refused to surrender, and his voice was too loud for the microphone he was yelling into— the overwhelmed digital whine on the receiving end caused the radio tech to crank the volume down hastily when his voice picked up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ferner, now suited in armor, though with his helmet under one arm, raised an eyebrow at Mittermeyer at this command. “I see that Commodore Leigh is no longer the one giving orders.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Some will surrender,” was all he could say, ignoring Ferner’s comment. “Take them prisoner if you can. They’ll be happy to swear loyalty later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Ferner said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer’s stolen white ship descended into Iserlohn, her shields protecting them from the worst of the movement of the liquid metal shell. Other ships in his fleet were already docking, taking positions indiscriminately in the empty bays. There was an odd sense of familiarity in this, despite the situation. How many times had he anticipated the feeling of coming home to Iserlohn? It was no different now, even if it was Yang he was waiting to meet, rather than Reuenthal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Alliance-facing side of Iserlohn had been spared the worst of the damage. Mittermeyer’s potshots at it with missiles, and their battle with the fleet, had glanced off the liquid metal shell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doors could be easily opened, since the computers were under the duke’s control, so they didn’t have to waste time cutting open paths through the fortress. Mittermeyer let Ferner handle the whole boarding operation— it was what he had been stationed on Cahokia specifically to do, and he knew Yang’s detailed plan for taking Iserlohn well. Their forces would need to meet up with Braunschweig’s soldiers on the other side, and since the fortress was some sixty kilometers across, they would have to take control of all the various elevator shafts and train tunnels, while simultaneously putting a stop to any intentional destruction of vital equipment from the fortress garrison.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer watched the progress of their boarding from his position on the white ship. He wanted to get to the Iserlohn control center and find Yang, but he couldn’t yet abandon his duties as fleet commander. He had various video feeds of his troops as they stormed Iserlohn, and when he wasn’t looking at a map of how people were progressing through the fortress, he watched those. A contingent of his soldiers forced their way through the smoke-filled greenhouses, a line of white armor pushing through rows of corn and soy. They found and deployed the irrigation systems, since the automatic fire-suppression had been disabled by the garrison as they burned Iserlohn’s supplies to nothing. Without gravity, the fire moved strangely, crawling along surfaces in unintuitive directions, and the smoke didn’t roil in clouds near the ceiling, but instead choked the air in a wide river between the fire and the air vents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Other teams stormed down the elevator shafts towards the central engines, and a real battle raged there for control of the fortress’s heart. Mittermeyer was hopeful that when that fell, and they were able to staunch some of the worst damage, the fortress’s remaining defenders would begin to surrender. Already, there had been some pockets where that was happening. Though they were few in number, it did give Mittermeyer hope that things would calm down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer listened to the radio. They had open communications now as they solidified control. What he wanted was to get on a private radio channel and speak to Yang, but that was impossible. He occasionally heard Yang’s voice answering questions or giving direction, though it was impossible to divine anything from it other than his exhaustion. Other voices mingled in the airwaves: Ferner, Braunschweig, Admiral Merkatz (apparently coming into Iserlohn in an escape pod— he seemed lucky to have survived), Flegel, and Ansbach. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although the chaos inside Iserlohn continued— a tempest in a teacup— a call came for Mittermeyer specifically. The voice delivering it, unpleasantly, was Ansbach’s. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral Mittermeyer,” he said, “Duke Braunschweig requests that you join him on the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> for a celebratory dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t exactly an offer that he could refuse, even though the last thing he wanted to see was most of the members of Braunschweig’s closest circle, including the one who was speaking. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It will be easier to move your ship into closer docks than trying to take yourself through Iserlohn,” Ansbach said. “I’ll provide you with landing instructions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m well aware of that. It seems a little early for a celebration dinner, if the fortress hasn’t been brought under control.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a pause from Ansbach, an empty silence like he had taken his finger off the transmit button on his mic. “Nevertheless,” he finally said, “your presence is requested.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that he had been ordered to take his mind off of the battle situation, Mittermeyer suddenly didn’t want to. But Ferner had it well under control, so there was no choice but for him to order his white ship to lift off, circle around Iserlohn, and land in the docking bays next to the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>. In this area of Iserlohn, the damage was very apparent, and he saw it up close when he left the white ship on foot (as much as one could be on foot without gravity), flanked by a squad of soldiers, just in case of trouble. He lingered outside Braunschweig’s flagship for a moment to survey the damage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Here, where the initial push into Iserlohn had been made, the walls were scorched with signs of both exploded zephyr gas and the pockmarks of laser shots. The doors had all been pulled open, and there were dead bodies that had drifted through the air to collect at the intake vents for the air filtration system, which had been turned back on. Their limbs tangled together and wavered in the slow moving air. It was grotesque, but horror wasn’t exactly what Mittermeyer felt to look at it. He turned away and pushed off the floor to head to the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, where the doors were open and waiting for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even after just a short jaunt outside, he was grateful for the feeling of gravity catching him as he entered the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and landed on his feet with a thump. The ship was a hive of activity, soldiers heading in and out on errands, but there was still someone waiting to escort him up to dinner in Braunschweig’s personal section of the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Outside the dining room was a lounge area, which only had one other person in it when he arrived. He should have been less punctual, he realized, because the person waiting in the lounge, a glass of wine already in hand, was Baron Flegel. He was looking out the huge window at the docking areas of Iserlohn, and at Mittermeyer’s stolen ship in particular. He turned around when he came in, and his smile curled unpleasantly. As Mittermeyer stepped closer, he discovered that although Flegel was clean and washed, one side of his face was bruised in a way that even a dusting of white makeup couldn’t disguise, and though he held himself with his usual proud swagger, he also winced when he lifted his arm to take a sip from his wine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral,” Flegel said, “how wonderful it is that you could join us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For dinner, or in Iserlohn?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For dinner, certainly.” Flegel turned back to the window and pointed at his ship. “I wasn’t aware that the high command gave out such pretty flagships to rear admirals who have been in recent disgrace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They don’t,” Mittermeyer said. “I stole her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bluntness with which he delivered the line made Flegel laugh. “You never fail to surprise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer didn’t have anything to say to that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s her name?” Flegel asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She doesn’t have one, aside from Test Ship 744.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t roll off the tongue. No nicknames?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not in particular.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because he had been planning to offer the ship to Yang, who would want to name it himself. Of course, he couldn’t say that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a creative man,” he said. “And I assume Her Majesty will want to give the ship to someone as a reward, since I stole it for her sake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You aren’t planning to fight for your right to it? As the spoils of war?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer stared Flegel down. “Baron Flegel, I thought you were well aware of what my thoughts are on soldiers looting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel barked out a laugh. “Of course. In this case, I can’t say it won’t benefit me for you to feel that way. I’ll have to ask my cousin for it,” he said. “Or my uncle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer cut himself off as the door opened and Duke Braunschweig came in, followed by Admiral Merkatz, Yang, Ansbach, and some young lieutenant commander that he didn’t recognize. Yang and Ansbach both looked the worse for wear— Ansbach in the way that he walked with a limp and favored his right side, and Yang in the way that his shoulders slumped with tiredness and his eyes roved over everything, searching for a chair to sit down in. Still, when he saw Mittermeyer, though his smile was so dim it could barely be called a smile, their eyes met, and that was all the reassurance that he needed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even if they had never spoken before, he had at least encountered most of the group at Yang’s wedding. Braunschweig seemed to have invited Mittermeyer to dinner only out of obligation, and had no desire to speak to him personally as they all headed into the dining room. Merkatz nodded hello, at least, though they were near strangers. The only one that Ansbach introduced him to was the youth, who carried himself with an unpleasantly false assuredness;  his voice was too loud in a way that revealed, rather than hid, his discomfort. That was Hans von Vering, the future husband of Kaiserin Elizabeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer couldn’t help but study Ansbach as they sat down, and he didn’t seem to be the only one to do so. As Ansbach took a seat at the dining table at Braunschweig’s left side, Flegel narrowed his eyes at him, though he didn’t seem to notice, or at least had no reaction. Yang, next to Ansbach, was so tired that his eyes were mostly closed, and he was staring into space over Mittermeyer’s head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was very strange for Mittermeyer to see Yang in this environment. He didn’t exactly seem comfortable— but then again, when did he ever truly appear comfortable outside of their brief hours alone? — but he wasn’t anxiously tugging at his hair. Perhaps Mittermeyer was the least acclimated to the room. He was an outsider to Braunschweig’s camp, and furthermore not a noble. When soldier-servants came around bearing wine and covered dishes, there was an unwritten protocol that everyone else in the room knew how to follow. He watched Yang and Ansbach across the table from himself, and just copied what they were doing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach didn’t even look at Yang, but it was clear that neither minded sitting next to each other. When Ansbach, left-handed, reached for his wine glass, his arm bumped Yang’s, and Yang glanced at him with a small smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig had been saying something across the table to Merkatz, but now Braunschweig raised his wine glass in a salute. “To our victory today,” he said. “They said that it couldn’t be done, but we have done it, gentlemen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To victory!” Flegel echoed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are things going inside Iserlohn?” Merkatz asked. His mood was much less jovial.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Getting better,” Ansbach answered. “I doubt the resistance will continue for much longer— we have the central computers and the main engines under our control. Without those, the damage that any remaining members of the garrison can do is limited. They’ll surrender—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If they haven’t by now, they’re not planning to,” Flegel said dismissively. “If they wish to fight to the death, so be it. There’s plenty of men who would rather be parted from their lives than their honor. Who are we to deny them that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz frowned. “They are Imperial soldiers,” he said. His tone was less ambiguous than his words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just like the fleet admiral,” Flegel said. “If I were in their position, I believe I would feel the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you?” Vering asked. Mittermeyer looked at him— Flegel had taken it as an insult, but the tone in his voice had been startlingly open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Flegel could snap back some kind of response, his face twisted in a sneer, Braunschweig said, “I don’t want people in my camp who aren’t ready to accept the Kaiserin,” he said. “It’s all the better if they make that known now, rather than later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Merkatz said. “I wouldn’t expect anyone who surrenders to fight for you until the civil war is over. They can be kept confined to specific quarters in Iserlohn until then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On that subject,” Braunschweig said, continuing as if Merkatz hadn’t said anything, “What do we all think about that amusing message from the Iserlohn fleet?” He laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What message?” Mittermeyer asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you wouldn’t have heard it,” Flegel said. “Our fleet that was chasing them picked it up— they were transmitting to all the other Imperial forces.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve made enemies of the Imperial fleet as a whole,” Merkatz said. “They ordered the Embassy on Phezzan to hunt any of Duke Braunschweig’s family down if they attempted to find refuge there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang, who hadn’t said anything yet, smiled down at his plate, presumably thinking about his Phezzani spy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel gestured with his wine glass. “It’s quite entertaining. Why would we flee through Phezzan, if we have control of Iserlohn? They forget that there is more than one path through the galaxy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you really want to spend the rest of your life in the rebel territories? I’m sure they just think you’d like to retire to Phezzan itself, if you were forced to make that kind of choice,” Mittermeyer said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel sniffed. “Maybe. I think they just find it difficult to understand what the writing on the wall means: we’ve won this war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Overconfidence is a poor quality in a soldier, it leads to under preparation,” Merkatz cautioned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think there’s any way we could fail to take Odin,” Braunschweig said. “Now that we have our ground force, and our alternate plan is in place, as much as I doubt I doubt we’ll need it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach spoke up. “So long as we can do it quickly. The destruction of Iserlohn’s supplies is going to put real pressure on our fleet’s resources.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not that long of a trip to the capital. And we can call in our favors to resupply us here, if need be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We should do that now, sir. The faster we can move materials, the better our position will be later, regardless if that’s a prolonged battle for Odin, or rebuilding after the war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig waved his hand. “Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Though it is a little unfortunate that the Imperial fleets are going to consider us their enemy,” Flegel said. “But none of their real outposts are anywhere near Odin, so I doubt we’ll have trouble getting there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you agree, Admiral Merkatz?” Braunschweig asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not aware of any movements of the Imperial forces, no. Fleet Admiral Muckenburger wanted to stay out of this war, and so if they are going to move, they’ll only have started now. They will try to obstruct us on the way to Odin— we should avoid that if we can. We’ll have to move quickly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then we should leave as soon as possible. It’s a race to Odin once again, it seems.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir,” Yang said. His voice had a strange effect on the room— everyone stopped what they were doing to listen to him, except for Braunschweig, who speared a piece of potato and put it in his mouth before looking at Yang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was looking through the recent transmissions that Iserlohn received, and I saw a message from the Phezzani embassy— it appears that Muckenburger was very concerned with a rebel invasion—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A rebel invasion?” Flegel asked. “Is that really likely?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Empire is fractured and weak right now, and it would be difficult to gather a coordinated defense. The rebels know this— it would almost be stupid of them not to launch an attack on us right now.” He paused. “The fleet admiral understood that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is Iserlohn defensible without the Thor Hammer?” Mittermeyer asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang met his eyes. “As defensible as any narrow corridor is,” he said. Mittermeyer’s mouth opened in surprised recognition of Yang’s meaning, but he said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then if the rebels come, we’ll defend it,” Braunschweig said. “I don’t foresee any problems.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I say something, sir?” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ansbach cut in before Yang could even open his mouth. “I believe Commodore von Leigh should discuss the details of troop placement over a map. He and I were just talking about how you yourself should remain at Iserlohn, with the bulk of your fleet. The ground troops should go to Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s face flitted through several different emotions and settled on anxiety, and he tugged at his hair, his meal forgotten.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why shouldn’t I go to Odin? Shouldn’t I claim the throne for my daughter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz seemed to have caught onto something that Mittermeyer hadn’t. “Duke Braunschweig, to put it bluntly, no you should not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s face reddened. “And why is that, Admiral?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz cleared his throat. “Sir, I am a soldier first, and I always have been.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An admirable quality,” Braunschweig said, warning in his tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But before he left, Count Mariendorf, acting in your best interest, charged me with understanding the political view of things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Across the table, Ansbach and Yang were both following this exchange with interest— it seemed they hadn’t coordinated this with Merkatz at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And?” Braunschweig asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you, sir, go to Odin without your daughter, and rule in her stead, you will turn the people against you. It is your daughter who has the right to rule, not yourself. If you make it clear that you do not respect the Goldenbaum line— what will this all be for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The silence around the table was profound— interrupted only by the sound of Vering putting down his wine glass a little too hard after an uncomfortably long second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Littenheim—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sabine, at the very least, has a crown on her head on Odin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig’s voice was uncharacteristically even. “And who will go to Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll go,” Flegel said immediately. “It shouldn’t be difficult. And then you and the Kaiserin can meet us there, when we’ve taken control.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flegel taking advantage of the situation deflated some of Braunschweig’s anger. “If we must,” he said. “Admiral Merkatz will take command of the fleet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Merkatz said. Yang looked across at Merkatz, rather searchingly, and Merkatz added. “I would appreciate Rear Admiral Mittermeyer joining me, if possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Braunschweig glanced at Mittermeyer with undisguised distaste. “Whatever for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My wife is on Odin,” Mittermeyer said quickly. “If only for that, I’d like the opportunity to get back to her quickly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The rear admiral is a capable commander,” Merkatz said. “We will have to coordinate troops on the ground and in the air, and if Baron Flegel and I are on Odin, I would like someone with a proven track record in the skies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Braunschweig said. “And I’ll be here at Iserlohn, waiting for the rebels.” He laughed, then looked at Yang. “Maybe it is a pity that we’ve destroyed the Thor Hammer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If at all possible, we shouldn’t let the rebels know that,” Yang said. “If they do come to the corridor, we should try to head them off with the fleet long before they get here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was there anything in Iserlohn’s computers that would tell us what the situation on Odin is?” Mittermeyer asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, not much,” Yang said. “Just that Littenheim has set himself up in the capital. Lichtenlade is still alive, but in hiding.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do we know how many troops he has?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, approximately,” Yang said. “I can go over all the information I have with you after dinner— Admiral Merkatz and Baron Flegel have already seen it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have we been able to contact Geiersburg?” Flegel asked. “I would love to report our victory to them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The conversation turned towards Braunschweig family matters, which didn’t interest Mittermeyer at all. He studied Yang, who had returned to looking down at his plate, and Ansbach, who now took the role of echoing Braunschweig’s thoughts back to him. Although he had never liked Ansbach, and had once had gotten great satisfaction out of decking him across his sallow little face, watching him act the parrot felt somewhat beneath him. When their eyes happened to meet across the table, Ansbach looked back at Mittermeyer unwaveringly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which of the three of them had changed since their school days? Mittermeyer wondered. He didn’t feel the difference in himself, nor in Yang— at least, not anything that he could put a finger on. But something inside him must have changed, imperceptibly but permanently. He disliked the sensation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the dinner was finished, Braunschweig and Flegel left to attend to something on the bridge of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Berlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and Vering, Ansbach, and Yang followed them out. Merkatz and Mittermeyer stayed behind in the dining area for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume we’ll have plenty of time en route to discuss our plan for Odin,” Mittermeyer said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We certainly will, and Leigh’s plan is quite comprehensive,” Merkatz agreed. “I appreciate you coming all this way. I’m not sure we would have won the day without your help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh would have found some way to win.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re very confident in him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t think so?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz made a noncommittal noise. “Leigh is brilliant,” he said. “That can’t be denied. And he has loyal friends.” There was almost a warning in Merkatz’s tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer paused. “And is that why you asked me to go with you to Odin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think we will have to trust each other, Rear Admiral,” Merkatz said. “No, I didn’t do it to separate you from him— he asked me to do so. I think he planned to remain on Iserlohn even if Duke Braunschweig went to Odin, and he trusts you to take care of things elsewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know why he’d prefer to stay at Iserlohn by himself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll have to ask him.” He looked at Mittermeyer squarely. “But it doesn’t escape me that you are personally loyal to him, rather than the duke— and I won’t ask about your loyalty to his daughter. I’d prefer not to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t crossing my fingers behind my back when I took my oath to serve in the fleet,” Mittermeyer said. “Sometimes I feel like I might be the only one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merkatz was not a laughing man, but he did have some approximation of a smile. “There are plenty of loyal men in this world,” Merkatz said. “But I’m glad we can work together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll need to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Merkatz said. His thoughts about Baron Flegel came through quite clearly in that one word, and Mittermeyer couldn’t help but smile. Merkatz stood. “This is a strange world we find ourselves in, Rear Admiral.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His words reminded him of something he had said to Reuenthal, months ago, when they were out celebrating Yang’s wedding. “It is,” he said. “I never could have predicted all of this. But I hope— when it’s all over— whatever’s on the other side will be better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That, I believe, is a quality that most of Leigh’s friends share.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe.” They headed out into the lounge area. Merkatz glanced at his stolen white ship out the window.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is a beautiful ship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m trying not to get attached— I doubt I’ll be able to keep her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Who will have her instead?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh, I hope. He deserves it. We’ll see if it happens.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leigh’s friends outnumber his detractors. I’m sure that between all of us and the facts at hand, we can make a compelling case to the Kaiserin. Leigh would never ask for himself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t aware that Leigh had many personal friends around here— aside from yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Allies, at the very least,” Merkatz said. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Rear Admiral. We should prepare ourselves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They came to the door to the hallway, and he and Mittermeyer turned in opposite directions, Mittermeyer intending to head to the bridge to find Yang, Merkatz turning towards the exit of the ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t have to go far— he heard Yang’s voice around a corner. It seemed like he had decided to wait for him so that they could spend the evening together, which made him smile, but the warmth was tempered by what he heard Yang saying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“—it would be worth it. A full scale invasion by the Alliance would be one of the worst things that could happen right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then let me suggest it. You need to learn to keep your mouth shut, My Lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer didn’t get a chance to hear Ansbach’s response— a moment of silence fell between them, and he decided that was his time to interrupt. He turned the corner to see Yang leaning against the wall, his head pressed against it, with his hair tousled and falling around his face. The wall seemed to be the only thing holding him up. Ansbach stood before him, arms crossed and a scowl on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Commodores,” Mittermeyer said, announcing himself. Ansbach glanced over at him, smoothed out his facial expression, and then nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be going,” he said. “Goodnight, gentlemen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ansbach—” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Ansbach just held up a hand in a half-wave and walked away. Yang didn’t straighten up from his lean against the wall until he was well and truly gone and Mittermeyer walked over. He smiled— a real smile this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t lecture me,” Yang said. “I’ve already heard it from him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what I’d lecture you about. I seem to be missing much of the context.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about it, then. Just assume you’d agree with him— I know you would.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I find that hard to believe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang put his hand on his arm. It was shocking, after so long in space by himself, and very welcome, though he couldn’t help but turn his head to make sure there was no one else coming down the corridor. “He’s—” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang didn’t seem to know how to complete his thought, but he looked at Mittermeyer, clearly hoping he would nevertheless understand him. He resigned himself to it. “Does he call you ‘My Lord’ to make up for trying to kill you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang visibly reddened and looked away. “He just does that because it annoys me. You notice it doesn’t stop him from telling me to shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer laughed. “Come on. Let me show you my stolen beauty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang dropped his hand from Mittermeyer’s arm, though with a lingering brush of their hands together, and let him lead him towards the white ship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even Yang, who was usually loathe to express admiration for weapons of war, couldn’t help but admire the ship. When they made their way into the open bay doors, he caught himself on the side for a moment and touched the gleaming white shell with his palm flat to the coated metal. Mittermeyer, from previous experience, knew how strange it felt— even when in their inactive state, the shields, with their machinery just below the skin of the ship, had such a strong effect that the delicate nerves in the hand could feel it. Tingling, like gooseflesh on a part of the body that couldn’t get gooseflesh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They didn’t talk about anything important on the way to Mittermeyer’s quarters— Yang was too tired, or too sad, to even ask about how his half of the battle had gone, aside from confirming that Captain Ferner was alright. Mittermeyer filled the silence by telling him about how he had acquired the ship, and what had happened to its red companion. The story made Yang smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t help but feel sympathy for expats,” Yang said. “Kircheis would like the story, I think. One going, one staying behind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I hope they don’t just take her apart. She’s too nice of a ship for that.” He decided not to tell Yang that he hoped to give this ship to him— he would protest. So instead he just held open the door to his personal quarters and let him step inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The furnishings left something to be desired. Usually, whoever was given a flagship of this stature would have their own furniture at hand to decorate with. But since he had stolen the ship on very short notice, the rooms were mostly bare, and only contained a few pieces that had been moved from the enlisted mens’ lounges and quarters. Since the ship’s crew was so minimal, the furniture’s absence hadn’t been noticed. But it gave his quarters an impersonal feeling. Yang didn’t notice, or at least didn’t care, and sat down on the creaking sofa, draping himself across it in his usual haphazard way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want something to drink?” Mittermeyer asked. Yang just yawned and held his hand out, inviting him to the couch with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to fall asleep before I could even finish drinking it,” he said. “I haven’t slept in about thirty hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not even the tank bed?” Mittermeyer asked, taking Yang’s hand. It was his left hand— with his wedding ring on it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Too busy,” Yang murmured. “It’s been a hard day, Wolf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” He should have sat on the couch, but instead he sat on the floor in front of it, leaning back against it, still holding Yang’s hand in his. Yang shifted, rolling onto his side so he could look at him. “We don’t have much time right now, do we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Iserlohn’s always just a place people pass through,” Yang said, sounding very melancholy. It was a funny thing to say about a place that had been intended to be a wall, rather than a door, but Yang had his own way of seeing things. “I’ll see you again on Odin— soon.” It sounded like he was promising it to himself, more than to Mittermeyer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t really understand why you’re having me go to Odin. I feel like I just got to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel responsible for all of this. But you can take care of things on Odin. I trust you.” His voice was low and quiet, half asleep already, maybe. “It won’t be long,” he said again. “And Oskar’s there…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you’ll be by yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t be by myself.” With his other hand, Yang combed his fingers through Mittermeyer’s hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you’ll have Ansbach.” Despite Yang’s sleepiness, Mittermeyer’s tone remained a little scathing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do trust him,” Yang said. He seemed to have figured out what he had wanted to say earlier. “He’s a good man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s hard for me to believe you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, he is,” Yang murmured. “Things would have been different if we had met somewhere else— if we all lived in the Alliance… or even Phezzan… somewhere else. Not that school…” He was trailing off in tiredness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does that have to do with it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was trapped— just like the rest of us,” Yang said. “That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were plenty of things he should have asked Yang about while he was still awake— what Ansbach had stopped him from saying to Braunschweig, what they should do about the possible Alliance invasion, what Yang wanted him to do when he got to Odin, what the rest of the civil war would look like— but all of that fell out of Mittermeyer’s mind as he sat there with Yang and held his hand, touching his gold wedding band, twisting it around his finger. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer pressed Yang’s hand to his face— his lips, not quite a kiss, then his cheek, then his forehead. He held it there, closing his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wen-li, when I get back to Odin—” Mittermeyer said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang waited.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to tell Evangeline.” It felt somehow more real to say it aloud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yang’s breath was a little unsteady, but his fingers continued their inexorable journey through his hair, across the crown of his head, towards his ears, the nape of his neck, then back up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” Yang said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mittermeyer did kiss Yang’s hand, then. </span>

  <em>
    <span>January 489 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a lean winter in the old Von Kummel country home in the woods, far from the capital city. The group staying there— Baron Heinrich von Kummel, Evangeline, Magdalena, Hilde, and Elfriede, and a rotating cast of Mariendorf family servants (the rest gone home to their families)— had enough to eat, and the house was easily heated with wood fires and solar panels, but the leanness was present nevertheless. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For Evangeline, it was less of a physical lack than it was a spiritual one. Despite the abundance of people in the house, she found herself quite lonely. It would have been easier to explain her loneliness if it had originated from some definable source, perhaps the way she was the only woman in the house of common lineage. But that wasn’t it. In the woods, so isolated from the rest of the universe, there was no real status left to hold on to. There was simply an aura of misery that pervaded the air, clinging to each woman in her own way, and Evangeline found herself helpless to change it, or to shake off her own troubles. It was the lack of anything to do— any sense of purpose— that led to rumination. Before, when Wolf had been deployed, Eva had plenty to occupy herself with, and that had kept her able to maintain a cheerful rigor in her life. There was nothing like that now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The four women drifted through the house like little ghosts. Hilde was the easiest one of them for Evangeline to talk to, but perhaps that was only because they had so little in common. With Magdalena, every conversation seemed to risk opening wounds. Eva didn’t know why that was suddenly the case, but it clearly was now. Magdalena’s smile always seemed false and brittle, even when there were guests to entertain. Certain topics of conversation made her flinch and stare off into space. Maybe Eva was the only one who noticed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But with Hilde, there was nothing they could talk to each other </span>
  <em>
    <span>about</span>
  </em>
  <span>, so the conversation rarely risked falling into dangerous territory, or if it did, it was only in one direction, and Hilde was good at hiding it. </span>

  <span>Hilde, Evangeline found, was a master of pragmatism. She spent most of her days in the library. She said she was studying, since she was missing her semester at Odin National University, but perhaps both of them knew that it was unlikely that she would simply rejoin her university course after the end of the war. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The books that Hilde stacked up around herself were not just the textbooks from her law course. When Magdalena went out on social visits or invited other guests to the house, Hilde always begged them for any books they might have in their country libraries. By doing this, she managed to accumulate quite a few on history and military strategy, which seemed to be her favorite topics. She said that reading kept her occupied, but when Evangeline walked by the library, she’d often find her standing by the window, looking out over the cold pines and the dim sun in the grey sky, hands clutched behind her back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva, half out of genuine kind-heartedness, and half out of a desire to relieve any part of the house’s oppressive atmosphere, baked cookies one day and brought a plate of them to Hilde. She knocked on the frame of the library door, and Hilde, staring out the window once more, jumped in surprise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you eaten?” Eva asked. She held out the cookies, still warm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lunch— ah, no.” It was almost five in the evening. “But I’ll take advantage of your generosity, if you’re offering.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. What else would I be doing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel like you should be telling me I’ll spoil my dinner if I eat right now,” Hilde said, checking her watch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you really think I’m that much of a nag?” Evangeline sat down on the couch, balancing the plate of treats on her knees, and Hilde took a seat next to her. There was a thick book open on the coffee table, lines of text so small that Eva couldn’t read it from where she sat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! Of course not!” She took a cookie just so that she could stop herself from saying anything else that might accidentally offend, but then she mumbled around it, holding her hand over her mouth in a facsimile of politeness. “You just are always asking how I’m doing— seems like the kind of thing someone who cares says.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was an odd way of phrasing things— but then again, Hilde’s mother had died when she was young, Eva remembered. She had probably come to that conclusion in a roundabout way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do care,” Eva said. “But do tell me if I’m being a pest— I don’t want to bother you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not. I appreciate the company.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence between them. Already, Eva had run out of things to say. “Have you heard anything from Herr Kircheis? I know he’s much better company than I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Hilde said. “Not since last week.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish I could tell you more,” Hilde said, sounding genuinely distraught. “I just don’t have any news…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright.” She leaned her shoulder on Hilde’s comfortingly, and Hilde didn’t seem to know what to do with the gesture. She stiffened, but smiled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was, every inch of her, Eva decided, a girl raised without any female companionship whatsoever. Without a mother and without any female friends, as far as Eva could tell. It seemed to her that Hilde lived a very lonely kind of existence, and was possibly even more out of place in the house than she was, even though they were all here on her cousin’s goodwill. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think all of the military details would go completely over my head, even if you gave them to me,” Eva said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure that’s not true. I could tell you what Hank’s plan is—” She reached for an open notebook and pen that were on the lower shelf of the coffee table before them, but then stopped herself. “But I’ll take your word for it if you don’t want to hear it.” She smiled, somewhat ruefully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think it would do me any good. And you’d get frustrated when I didn’t understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I promise I wouldn’t,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva reached over and flipped a couple pages of the heavy book on the table, turning to a map with a dizzying array of colorful lines drawn across it. “I think if I understood what Wolf did out there, I’d be more worried than not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really? Not knowing drives me crazy.” She laughed. “Probably why I’m such bad company around here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well—” Eva put the cookies down on the table so she could explain, gesturing though there was nothing much to gesture to. “It’s that— you see— I </span>
  <em>
    <span>trust</span>
  </em>
  <span> Wolf to know what to do, and to come back to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But if I had all of the information, I’d just start picking at it, thinking about all the ways it could go wrong— not that I wouldn’t expect Wolf to overcome them, but— I’d be afraid for him, thinking about it all, and there would be nothing I could do to fix it. And he’s never wanted me to worry like that— he’s told me not to, since it upsets him to think that I’m making myself unhappy, worrying for him. So I shouldn’t take it upon myself— it wouldn’t do either of us any good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde was silent for a moment. “Yeah,” she said. “I understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s strange that you don’t feel the same way. I guess we’re very different people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know…” Hilde said. “Maybe because there’s a part of me that thinks if I know enough, I can fix something. Maybe that’s silly.” She looked out the window. “Sieg offered to let me go back to the city to live with him,” she said. “Even though my father wouldn’t want me to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is much safer out here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to go back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t really want to leave Heinrich,” Hilde said— but that was clearly a non-answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I think he has plenty of company. Do you want to be with Herr Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean—” Hilde suddenly seemed very flustered. She picked up another cookie, but didn’t eat it. “There’s nothing to </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> in the city either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe that’s for the best,” Eva said. “I wouldn’t want Herr Kircheis to be in danger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again there was a moment of silence. “Well,” Eva said, “whatever you decide to do— I’ll support you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks. I suppose you don’t know my father very well, so you wouldn’t have to worry about upsetting him by letting me do something dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not </span>
  <em>
    <span>letting </span>
  </em>
  <span>you,” Eva said. “You’re your own woman, and I wasn’t put in charge of you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde laughed. “Very true. But thank you, really.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.” Eva stood. “I should go see if there’s anything I can do to help move dinner along.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Perhaps surprisingly, it was Heinrich that Eva spent the most time with. It might have first been out of pity, although she wouldn’t have admitted that. The man was suffering the winter’s leanness in the most physical way: his seizure medication had run out, and no matter how far and wide anyone looked, there wasn’t any more of it to be found. When one of the resulting seizures caused him to fall out of his wheelchair and fracture his collarbone, his doctor prescribed him an alternative, but it didn’t stop seizures at their source, and instead simply made him so weak that he could barely move. When one of them came over him now, instead of the violent clenching of muscles that had terrified Eva when she had first witnessed it, they were now a kind of vacant shudder that passed over him. His eyes rolled back in his head and his mouth twitched uncontrollably. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva had never before thought much about the way that the brain was an object, and a delicate one. Before coming to Heinrich’s house, she had maintained the vague belief in a soul that came from not thinking much about the idea. For some reason, learning from Reuenthal that Wolf’s secret was not what she had imagined had severely shaken her abstract faith. Watching the way Heinrich ceased to be himself during his seizures impressed on her how fragile and physical the spirit was, to the point where she found she had no faith left at all. She spent quite a lot of time thinking about it now, sitting at Heinrich’s bedside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He enjoyed her company, and she his. It didn’t seem at all improper to spend so much time with him, which in itself Eva felt sorry for: even that part of being a man was denied to him. She knew Wolf would never resent her time with him, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he was awake and alert enough to focus, she would read to him: books of poetry and short stories, mostly, provided by Maggie’s friend Count Landsberg. Sometimes Hilde would bring in one of the books of history that she had finished, and Eva would patiently go through that one as well, but it wasn’t her preference, and Heinrich told her to pick what she liked, since he didn’t want to do anything that would risk straining her patience. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Heinrich was too tired to focus, Eva would paint or knit. She set up her watercolor paper on an easel, tilted so that he could see it, and she painted picture after picture. She wasn’t anything more than a hobbyist painter, but she enjoyed it, and the paintings had a charm of their own. They were mostly imagined landscapes: mountains, summer skies, birds wheeling above the ocean. Heinrich liked watching them take shape, seeing some glimpse of a world beyond his bedside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sometimes, she painted portraits, working from old photographs. She drew a picture of Hilde and Heinrich as children, and that one ended up pinned to the wall where Heinrich could look at it at any time. She painted Wolf and herself from a photo taken at Hank’s wedding, and that one, too, was given a place of honor in Heinrich’s bedroom. She gave pictures of Hank and Kircheis to Maggie and Hilde, respectively, and even worked up the nerve to paint Reuenthal for Elfriede— though she didn’t quite work up the nerve to give her the picture. It was one of the best of the lot, painted more from memory than from the photograph. His expression was the one she had remembered from years ago: her wedding day, when he had kissed her hand. There was something so cold and miserable in his eyes that day, and that same look stared out from the otherwise unassuming portrait of Reuenthal, sitting in front of a dark window. She ended up tucking that painting in among the discarded stack of less-than-perfect landscapes, which were tossed into a desk drawer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Heinrich slept, she occasionally turned her easel around so that she could paint him. They were just simple little sketches, trying to capture the gentle way sleep smoothed out the pain in his eyes. These paintings, she kept tucked away. She supposed she would probably give them to Hilde and Count Mariendorf eventually, when the inevitable happened, but they were hers for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t always stay around when he was sleeping— he was only awake for a few hours a day— but she did spend most of his waking time with him. He was quite deliberate in telling her how much he appreciated her company, though it always made her flush. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I enjoy your company, too,” she’d say. “You make it sound like I’m obliging you. I’m not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You say so. But don’t feel like you need to stay for my sake, Eva.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know, Heinrich— I’m quite lonely when you’re asleep.” She didn’t know if he believed her, but it was true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The only time that she didn’t stay with him was when his priest came by. She didn’t know his name, since Heinrich only ever called him Father. He was as nondescript as men come, with brown hair and Imperial blue eyes. The only thing unusual about him was the white Earth Church stole that he draped over the shoulders of his black suit. The priest slipped in and out of the house without speaking to anyone, except the servant who let him in and Heinrich up in his bedroom. The door to Heinrich’s room was left open during his visits, in case he had an emergency, but it meant that Eva could hear the man’s sonorous voice as he read scriptures and gave Heinrich some blessed water to drink. During these visits, Heinrich rarely said anything aside from the words of the prayers, and Eva always gave him space afterwards. When the priest left, he usually stared out the window quietly for some time, watching the snow swirl across the glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde didn’t mind her cousin’s religious beliefs, and Magdalena avoided the subject, but Elfriede was dismissive. On one of the rare occasions that the four women all ate dinner together, she told Hilde, “You ought to put a stop to that priest coming here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would I do that?” Hilde asked. “It makes Heinrich happy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes— exactly,” Elfriede said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you want to take away a dying man’s happiness?” Maggie asked. “Come on, El. Even you’re not that sick.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They flatter him,” Elfriede said, ignoring Magdalena entirely. “They just want his money, when he dies. He hasn’t got an heir— he’ll leave everything he can to them. It’s twisted, isn’t it?” She delivered this in a very flat tone, though still somehow mocking. “I expect you’d inherit, if he doesn’t bequeath it all to them, in exchange for them feeding him a fantasy. I suppose every sick man wants to believe their soul will fly away somewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde’s face turned various colors in the dim light, pale and then red. “I don’t care about the money,” she said. “And I’ll thank you to never mention this to Heinrich— and don’t bother his priest, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re all here because Heinrich is kind enough to let us stay here,” Eva said. “If he wants to be a charitable man, then I’m thankful to be a recipient of his charity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede laughed. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And where would you be if you weren’t here with us?” Magdalena asked. “If it’s so disagreeable, you’re free to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede tipped her glass at Magdalena in a mock toast. “Of course not, </span>
  <em>
    <span>darling</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I’m so very happy to be here with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde stood up without another word, then picked up her plate to bring it to the kitchen with such jerky movements that she dropped her fork on the floor. Eva retrieved it, gave an apologetic glance to the other two women, then followed Hilde out into the kitchen with her own dishes in hand. She dropped them into the sink while Hilde stared out the dark kitchen window.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you alright, Hilde?” Eva asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I’m fine.” But her voice came out choked, and she didn’t turn away from the window to look at Eva. “Thank you—” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For being kind to Heinrich.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s my friend,” Eva said. “You don’t have to thank me for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde nodded and didn’t say anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Evangeline brought up the subject the next day, when she was sitting with Heinrich. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heinrich,” she said. “Can I ask you a personal question?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He rolled his head towards her; he had been staring out the window again. The sun was just going down, and his bedroom was lit by the light, incongruously golden for how cold it was. It made his white hair and pale face seem less deathly, at least for a moment. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did you start believing in Terraism?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh—” He laughed, which turned into a wheeze. “You’ll think I’m very stupid if I tell you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Years ago— back when I was a little better, and could still go out sometimes— the church put on an exhibition in the capital. They put up paintings for display that hadn’t been shown publicly in hundreds of years… all landscapes of Earth. The exhibition was called “A Home You Can Go Back To,” I think. And there were so many paintings that I thought had been lost in the Thirteen Days’ War, and after… but there they were.” He closed his eyes. “There was one— mostly they didn’t have figures in them— but a few did. There was one that had this girl in a field of dry grass, crawling— dragging herself by her hands— towards a house off in the distance. It was all by itself on one wall, and I just sat in front of it— you really must think I’m silly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not, Heinrich.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I cried like a baby,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have a picture of it?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pointed to the bookshelf on the other side of the wall. “They printed a book of the exhibition.” Eva got up and found the book, taking it down from the shelf. It instantly fell open in her hands to the correct page— not by miracle, simply because Heinrich had opened it himself so many times. The book’s floppy spine was creased to the point of nearly falling apart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The painting itself was greyer and grimmer than Eva had expected, but she could immediately see why Heinrich was drawn to it. It had an arresting, simple composition, and the little blurb off to the side described the woman’s crippled condition. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a beautiful picture,” Eva said. “I can see why you like it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heinrich hadn’t yet opened his eyes. “I know I’ll never— do anything, never go anywhere,” he said. “And it looks like she’ll never make it there either— the house is so far away. But the idea that there was a place for her… somewhere she could go where…” He didn’t finish the sentence, but Eva could imagine the end of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva sat back down next to Heinrich and took his hand. It was very cold and waxy, like a corpse. “I understand,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should tell me that this is just propaganda working on me,” he said, deflecting some of the painful earnesty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t say that,” she said. “I think it’s a beautiful story.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t see how.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was quiet. “I think I would find it very hard…” she said. “Hard to believe in a kind natural world when…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When I’m like this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I would want to blame— you worship Mother Earth, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would be angry,” Eva said. “I don’t know— I feel angry </span>
  <em>
    <span>for</span>
  </em>
  <span> you.” And it wasn’t just for Heinrich, she realized, though it would have felt too gauche to bring up her own troubles. Her other hand balled into a fist against her stomach. It was difficult to believe in a loving mother when that was the one thing she couldn’t be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned his head away. “I am angry,” he said. He kept his voice very flat. “But what can I do with that? Could you read to me again, Eva?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course— of course, Heinrich.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>There wasn’t anything to do in the von Kummel house except wait for time to pass. It would have felt maddening, if she had framed it that way to herself, but she just focused on individual moments, and not the larger days that they formed, and weeks on top of that, and then months, January giving way to February. It would soon be March, but she didn’t let herself look forward to spring: that seemed too far away to be real. Eva thought that perhaps she could pass an indefinite amount of time this way, in a spiritual hibernation, except that one day, quite abruptly and without any warning whatsoever, it ended.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oskar von Reuenthal and Siegfried Kircheis appeared at their door one evening, long after the four women had already eaten their dinner. They must have missed their own meal, since the city was several hours’ drive from the country home, and the servant who answered the door ushered them both into the dining room so that they could eat something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis slipped out to find Hilde immediately. Eva encountered him in the hallway, but there was something very unhappy in his usually-placid eyes, so she let him brush past without saying more than hello, and telling him that Hilde was in the library.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal was in the dining room, but he hadn’t sat down. He was looking at the painting of Hank, which Maggie had hung on the wall. The wooden paneling was darker, less sun-faded, in a large rectangle around where the simple watercolor portrait was hanging: Maggie had taken down an old framed hunting scene to put Hank up in its place. The old painting, which no one had removed yet, leaned against the wall near Reuenthal’s feet. He looked over at her when she came in, then turned back to the painting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you paint this?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a good likeness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh— I wasn’t sure if I had gotten his expression right.” In the painting, Hank lounged on a couch, his arm beneath his head, smiling wistfully out at the viewer. Eva had used as a reference a photo from his wedding, but she had tried to temper the alert, almost nervous, smile he had on his face in the photo, to give him a more peaceful expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did.” Reuenthal kept looking at it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is everything alright, Herr Reuenthal?” she asked. “I assume you wouldn’t be here if there wasn’t urgent business.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Braunschweig took Iserlohn,” Reuenthal said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Involuntarily, Eva put her hand over her mouth. “And Wolf— and Hank—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Reuenthal said. “The only reason that we know this is that the remainder of the Iserlohn Fortress Fleet issued a command to the outlying Imperial forces, declaring Braunschweig an enemy of the state. They’re to make every effort to kill him, and anyone working for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva’s heart twisted in her chest and she felt faint. Blindly, she reached for one of the dining room chairs and sat down in it. Reuenthal didn’t turn to look at her at all. When she had collected herself enough to speak, she asked, “Is that why you’re here? To warn us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I need to speak to Elfriede. I told one of the servants to get her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This has given Littenheim a way to win the civil war. If he finds Lichtenlade, and Lichtenlade surrenders to him and declares his daughter the Kaiserin, Braunschweig would have to fight the entire Imperial Fleet to re-take whatever measure of legitimacy he has— all Littenheim would need to do would be to hold out until the Imperial fleet arrives, and they’re on their way. The only way Braunschweig can now win is by forcing Lichtenlade to surrender to him and order the Imperial fleet to stand down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” She didn’t quite understand the ramifications of everything Reuenthal was saying, but she didn’t have any reason to doubt that it was true. “Why do you need Elfriede?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s Lichtenlade’s grand-niece, and knows where they’re hiding.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t already ask her that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It hadn’t been necessary before now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” She should have asked what Reuenthal planned to do with the information, but she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lichtenlade hopes that Braunschweig will destroy Littenheim for him, and then the Imperial fleet will take out Braunschweig,” Reuenthal said, talking mostly to himself. There was almost a smirk in his voice. “I don’t think Lichtenlade expected to win, before now. But now he thinks he might, without lifting much of a finger. How convenient for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva opened her mouth, but then the door to the dining room opened, and Kircheis entered, followed by Elfriede and Hilde. Reuenthal finally turned away from the painting of Hank.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Oskar,” Elfriede said. “Did you miss me?” She crossed the room towards him and touched his cheek with two fingers, tracing from the corner of his mouth towards his ear. He didn’t move at all until she had almost brushed completely past him, and then he grabbed her wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed, but it sounded as false as his voice did. “You must be lonely in your house without me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m staying in the Braunschweig safehouse,” Reuenthal said. “I wouldn’t even know if my house had burned to the ground.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe it has.” She pulled her hand out of his grip and took a seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you staying?” he asked Hilde.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like to,” she said. He looked at her with a cold, evaluating expression, but said nothing to contradict her. There were only four chairs in the smaller dining room, and so Eva stood and offered her seat to Hilde. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh— I could get another chair,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright. I don’t think I need to be involved,” she said, offering Hilde a smile. “I’ll see if Maggie is around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She went out,” Elfriede said. “Visiting her count again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Reuenthal asked, a certain viciousness in his tone that startled Eva.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Landsberg,” she explained, trying to soothe whatever was annoying Reuenthal. “He’s a nice man, and she’ll be back soon. Are you planning on staying the night?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. We need to get back to the capital as fast as possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry to hear that.” She looked around at everyone at the table. Although Hilde and Kircheis smiled at her, it was clear that they were waiting for her to leave. She gave an apologetic smile and stepped out, shutting the door behind herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The meeting went on for several hours, and Magdalena returned in the middle of it. Eva was in the kitchen, waiting for her to come back. She was drawing to keep herself occupied— another picture of Heinrich— but she tucked the preliminary sketch away when she saw the headlights of Magdalena’s car pierce the snowy air. Magdalena entered through the side door with her typical bluster, shaking her fur coat off and stomping her boots, the little bells that decorated the ankles jingling merrily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, darling,” she said to Eva. “Am I late? Did you miss me? I see Herr Kircheis is here for a visit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Herr Reuenthal,” Eva said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena immediately grasped the severity of the situation. There was no world in which Reuenthal would come all this way for a social visit. After she recovered from her momentary shock, she plastered cheer to her face again. “Marvelous. I should have invited my friend back with me— we could have made it a real party.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re not staying the night. They have to get back to the capital right away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, El will be so disappointed to hear that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She knows. She and Hilde are in the dining room with them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And they’ve shunned you— a pity.” Magdalena’s lightness was ringing falser by the second, and she finally dropped it entirely, except for her tone. “What are they talking about, do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hank and Wolf took Iserlohn, he said.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh! Well, of course they did. So they’re on their way back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva explained what Reuenthal had told her, though she feared the explanation was so garbled that Magdalena wouldn’t understand any of it. But Magdalena seemed to understand it just fine, so much so that she had to turn away from Eva, to stop her from seeing the paleness of her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She opened and closed the kitchen cabinets, muttering, “Oh, where are the tumblers,” to herself as she pretended to look for glasses and bottles of alcohol, though she knew very well where all of the things were.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should ask Herr Reuenthal to tell you about it, before he goes— I’m sure he could explain it better than I could,” Eva said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understood you perfectly well, darling.” Magdalena stopped fishing in the cupboards and took out the whiskey and glasses. “Care for some?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena filled her own glass to the brim. “To Hank and Wolf! And Iserlohn!” she said, and then drank. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave a little wave and walked out of the kitchen, holding her glass and the bottle. Eva was tempted to follow her, but she didn’t want to be followed, that was clear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva sat in the kitchen, tracing the wood grain of the table in there with her finger, until she heard the dining room door open and voices in the hallway. She headed into the foyer to meet them, but found only Kircheis and Hilde— Reuenthal and Elfriede had already gone off somewhere else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure?” Kircheis was asking. In the dim foyer, they were facing each other. Hilde clutched a sheaf of papers under her arm. “You don’t think your father will mind? Commodore Leigh will be mad at me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think he’ll have to understand,” she said. “I’ve made up my mind. Unless you don’t want me to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course— I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both stopped talking when Eva came in. “Am I interrupting? I can go— I just didn’t want to miss you, if you were leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s fine,” Hilde said. “I’d tell you in a moment anyway— I’m going to go back to the capital. I’ll leave tomorrow, after I’ve packed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Eva said. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I can be useful there,” Hilde said. She proffered her sheaf of notes to Kircheis. “Do you want these, or can I transcribe them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’ll be in the city tomorrow, you can keep them. Do you want me to stay the night?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No— it’s fine. I’m sure you have things you need to do. You can pick me up outside the city tomorrow. I’ll have to hand off the car.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reuenthal entered the hallway. “Are you ready to go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Kircheis said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you see Magdalena?” Eva asked Reuenthal. “I’m sure she wanted to say hello, or goodbye.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I saw her,” Reuenthal said. “Goodnight, Frau Mittermeyer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight,” Eva said. She felt very strange. When Reuenthal reached the door, she said, “Herr Reuenthal—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please do stay safe, whatever you’re planning to do.” She brought to mind the strange, sad expression of his in the hidden painting upstairs. “For Wolf and Hank’s sake,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stared at her, and she met his eyes. He searched for something in her expression, and didn’t find what he was looking for. She was too guileless, maybe, and he was too cold. “Goodnight,” he said again, and headed out the door, followed swiftly by Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva leaned against the wall, feeling the sudden weight of the hallway’s silence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you alright, Eva?” Hilde— always sweet— asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine.” She straightened and smiled. “You must be exhausted. You were in there for a long time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no. It was very interesting.” She looked down at the sheaf of papers in her hands. “Honestly, it’s for the best that I don’t think I could sleep after all that. I’ll have to put these in some kind of order.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it very complicated?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Hilde said. “It’s nothing like the wargames I used to play with Hank and Sieg… But I guess life isn’t ever really like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know where Elfriede went?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think she was going to find Maggie, with the rear admiral.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde sighed. “Oh— Eva, you’ll have to help me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, with what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to tell Heinrich I’m leaving. He’s—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll understand,” Eva said. “I think you should give him more credit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. It just seems like I’m abandoning him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be here,” Eva said. “But you should tell him yourself. He would rather hear it from you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, I know.” Hilde sighed and looked down at her papers again. “He’s asleep right now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He probably won’t be awake until ten tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see him then,” she said, resolving herself. “And then I’ll have to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Eva said. She put her hand on Hilde’s arm. “If you change your mind— I’m sure you’re always welcome here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde smiled. “I know.” She checked her watch. “I’d better get to work on this, if I want any chance of packing and sleeping.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She trooped up the stairs to the bedrooms on the second floor, leaving Eva alone in the foyer. She looked out the front window. The tracks where Kircheis and Reuenthal’s car had driven off were already being swept away by the hard wind. She couldn’t wait for spring to arrive, but it seemed further off every day. How long she lingered by the window, she didn’t know. She didn’t want to go find Maggie and convince her to go to bed, but it was almost certainly a duty that she would have to undertake. She shook herself out of her reverie, from picturing Reuenthal out in the snow, and made her way through the dark house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could hear Elfriede talking to Magdalena in the back parlor. The door was ajar, as if inviting Eva to walk in. This was a common tactic of Elfriede’s— she’d bait out an interruption, and then be annoyed by it. It seemed to amuse her, though Eva couldn’t fathom why. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how you can be so heartless about it,” Maggie said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heartless? I thought I was doing this out of love.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena laughed, hard and uncharacteristic. She was very drunk. “Love? I don’t think you’re capable of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not? That’s very funny, from you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you never loved me,” Maggie said. “We were just in the same place at the same time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And here we are again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re doing this just to hurt me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe.” It was Elfriede’s turn to laugh. “I certainly don’t care what happens to my family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’ll live,” Magdalena said. “Oskar needs your grand-uncle alive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, but not poor, poor Erwin Josef.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s a child!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And that makes him so much easier to get rid of. Doesn’t it? He’s an inconvenient little king to have around.” When Maggie didn’t say anything, Elfriede just kept talking. “They need my grand-uncle to have a </span>
  <em>
    <span>reason</span>
  </em>
  <span> to surrender— he can’t have a little child-Kaiser that he thinks he can keep on the throne. Poor little Erwin—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hate you! I hate you! Fuck!” There was the sound of glass shattering, and Elfried laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, go ahead. How do you think I feel?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t care! You’re fucking sick.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s seven— right?” Elfriede asked. “Well, whatever. How many years did you cost me, Mags. How many?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t me—” Magdalena’s voice broke. “You—” She was crying. Eva had never heard Maggie cry before, not like this. Open sobbing, hard breath, words that she couldn’t get out right. “You can’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> this—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s really your fault, Mags,” Elfriede said. “If you hadn’t introduced me to Oskar…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was trying to make it right,” Maggie said. “I was trying—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, so am I.” Elfriede stepped towards the door, and Eva pressed herself back against the hallway wall as she came out. There was no way Elfriede could avoid seeing her, and their eyes met as she brushed past.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite the calm cruelty in Elfriede’s voice, she looked shaken and pale, and when she nodded at Eva, she didn’t muster anything else horrid to say, even though it would have been very easy to. She headed upstairs, and Eva went into the back parlor where Maggie was sobbing on the couch. She shut the door behind herself, and Maggie didn’t even look up at the sound, her face buried in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva had to be very careful to avoid the shattered glass on the wood floor as she made her way to Maggie’s side, and she squeezed herself onto the couch beside her and silently wrapped her in her arms, tucking her face against Maggie’s shoulder. This only made her cry harder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eva—” Maggie sobbed. “Eva, I can’t live like this. I can’t—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh,” Eva said. “It’ll be okay, it’ll be okay…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I promised— I did everything to keep her safe and I promised— I never wanted this to happen— I can’t live like this—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva rocked her back and forth in her arms. Magdalena was crying so hard that she was choking on her own tears, unable to breathe, shaking and coughing. It wouldn’t have surprised Eva if she threw up from it, but she didn’t. Eva clung to her with all her strength, afraid if she let go, Magdalena might do something truly drastic. There was only so long a person could cry, Eva knew. There had to be an end to the tears, and Eva would just hold on until then. However long it took. She could do that, at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie,” she whispered. “It’s alright, it’s alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not alright. It’s never—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll get Kircheis to stop it,” Eva said. “It’ll be alright…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He can’t stop it,” Maggie said. “He won’t even be there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll talk to Herr Reuenthal, then,” Eva said. “I’ll go back to the city with Hilde tomorrow. He’ll listen to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He won’t,” Magdalena said. “You know he won’t. You know it—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t know it. In fact, it frightened her that Maggie thought the man that Wolf and Hank clearly trusted would not be dissuaded from murdering a child. Had she been deliberately ignoring something, or was Maggie wrong? The possibility of the former discomfited her, because of how easily true it was. She turned a blind eye to at least one thing— one thing she knew would hurt her, whatever it was. She clutched Maggie tighter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There has to be something we can do,” Eva said. “Shhh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena’s sobbing began to quiet, until it was just her ragged breathing, and even that steadied. It took some time, but Eva held her steady. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eva…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Maggie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you help me?” she asked. Her voice was still rough, still full of pain, but whatever thought that she had seized on had given her strength.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Eva said. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t say that until you know what I’m going to ask of you,” Maggie said. “Never agree to a favor before it’s asked. Never.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want me to do?” Eva asked. “I want to help you.” She pressed her cheek against Maggie’s shoulder, inviting Maggie to rest her head on hers. But she sat up straight now, though her whole body trembled, shivered. Maggie stared straight ahead of herself into space. “We have to get him out of there,” she said. “That’s the only way he’ll live. Is if he’s not here anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Eva said. She knew she was agreeing to something much more difficult than she could possibly imagine, but she couldn’t say anything else. She pictured the child-that-wasn’t, the child of her dreams, and then she pictured the young Erwin Josef, whom she had only seen in photos. He was real, if nothing else, and Eva wanted him to live, too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps that was all it took. Perhaps she would have said the same for any child— but this was the child that Maggie loved, and Eva would do it for her. She didn’t have a choice, not at all. It was like when Wolf had asked her to marry him— her mind had been made up in some fixed, unchangeable way long before the moment came. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maggie looked at her. “Thank you,” she said. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t apologize— I want to help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you understand—” Maggie said. “I don’t think you know what it will cost you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t care,” Eva said. She turned Maggie to face her, looked into her red eyes. “I’ll do it for you. Tell me what I have to do— I’ll do it.”</span>

  <em>
    <span>February 489 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde didn’t sleep for more than forty minutes that night. She knew that was foolish of her, since there might not be time for sleeping later and she should take what she could get now, but it was exactly that knowledge that made her unwilling to lie down. She instead spent the night packing her few things that she would want to bring to Kircheis’s apartment and transcribing the plan they had worked out into her computer. She didn’t realize that it was morning until the cold winter sun began to stream through her window and she heard a knock on her door. She opened it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Eva (wonderful, kind-hearted Eva) standing there in her bathrobe and proffering a steaming mug of coffee and a plate of toast and eggs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would have come down to breakfast,” Hilde said. “But thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think there’s going to be much of a breakfast,” Eva said. “I don’t know how you missed Maggie and Elfriede’s screaming match last night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—” Hilde flushed. “I didn’t want to get involved. I figured it was personal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Maggie told me what it was about. Maybe for the best that you resisted any temptation to walk in on it.” She smiled. “Can I come in?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, of course.” She took the offered breakfast out of Eva’s hands and held the door open with her foot. Hilde’s room, usually quite neat, was currently in a state of complete disarray: papers everywhere so that she could see all her notes at once, and a jumble of clothes that she had picked through to find what she wanted to bring back to the city. Her small bag was neatly packed in the corner— she wouldn’t need much, and anything she was missing, she figured she could borrow from Sieg. She was even still dressed in her clothes from the night before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva shuffled some of the papers around on the bed and then sat down on it, while Hilde took her seat at her desk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve made this place look like Hank’s office,” Eva said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish I could be flattered by the comparison.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva laughed. “I see you’re all packed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah… I’ll get going as soon as I’ve said goodbye to Heinrich. He’s not awake yet, is he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, not yet.” Eva paused. “I’m sorry you’re leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to apologize. I told you: I’d support you in whatever you do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva was quiet for a moment, and looked down at the papers she had scooted out of the way. She picked up one— the one with the initial sketched floorplan of the Lichtenlade safehouse that Elfriede had described the night before. Her face held absolutely no recognition of what she was looking at; she studied it, shook her head, and put it down. “I suppose it’s different, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s different?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I try not to worry about Wolf, but I feel like I have to worry about you, and Herr Kircheis, and Herr Reuenthal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If it’s any comfort, Sieg and I won’t be there,” she said. “We’ll be providing a distraction, so that Littenheim’s secret police can’t just follow what we’re doing and learn where Lichtenlade is hiding through us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That makes sense,” Eva said. “But Herr Reuenthal—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll be alright,” Hilde said. “It’s a good plan, I think. He thought of most of it— except what they worked out with Captain Oberstein before they came.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva nodded silently. She flipped through a couple more of the pages on the bed as Hilde folded her pile of scrambled eggs onto her toast. Suddenly, as Hilde was eating, Eva said, “I really hate to ask, but can you explain it to me? I know there’s nothing I can </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but I guess it feels different when it’s so close.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course!” Hilde said. “I’m happy to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t want to waste your time…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde glanced at her watch. “You’re not. If Heinrich won’t be up for another couple hours, there’s nothing else I have to do before I leave. Aside from say goodbye to Maggie and Elfriede— if they’re in the mood.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no idea,” Eva said. “I think— well, one problem at a time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to play peacemaker? I don’t envy you,” she said as she ate her breakfast. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll try,” Eva said. “What else am I good for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t say that!” Hilde wiped off her hands and shoved her plate to the side. She moved to the narrow bed where Eva was sitting, and gathered up all the papers. As she shuffled them into a neater stack, she said, “I’ve always really admired that about you, honestly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Eva said. There was something very strained in her voice, and Hilde looked away, down at the sheaf of messy, handwritten notes. She cleared her throat and pulled one to the top of the stack, and tried to think about how Hank would explain things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, uh, you know why we need to go to get Lichtenlade, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She explained the plan to Eva for about an hour, going over their goals and how confident they were in each step of the multi-faceted plan. In order to capture Lichtenlade and Erwin Josef, they would need to get to the mountain home where Lichtenlade’s family was hiding, break past the security without the family noticing, and get into the house to catch the important people before they had a chance to flee into hidden passages dug into the mountains. The house Elfriede described was a stately manor, but one built over old mines, which the Lichtenlade family had kept as a refuge and escape hastch of last resort. They were so deep, she said, that they could survive a nuclear blast down there. So long as Reuenthal and his men could capture the family before they fled, after that, it was a matter of getting out alive, and bringing the captives back to a Braunschweig safehouse without Littenheim’s men discovering where they were.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva, despite saying that she wouldn’t understand any of it, was an intelligent woman, and when she asked questions, they were astute ones: often things that she or Kircheis had wondered about during their initial planning. The one part of the plan that Hilde unfortunately had to gloss over was Kircheis’s role, though only because it hadn’t been decided yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We need a distraction,” she said. “Ideally in the capital, ideally at Neue Sanssouci itself, but anything that keeps Littenheim’s secret police occupied. I don’t know what that’s going to be yet,” she said. “That’s Sieg’s responsibility to figure out. Once we have that in place, that’s when we’ll strike.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe the hardness in her voice startled Eva, because she looked away. “When you know the date— can you let me know?” Eva asked. “I think… I don’t want to be alone that day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Hilde said. She took Eva’s hand and squeezed it in between her own. “Of course. I’ll… send a letter by courier, or come up here to let you know, or something like that.” She laughed, but it was grim. “Everything was a lot easier when the phones weren’t down.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eva let Hilde know when her cousin had finally woken up, and Hilde knocked on the doorframe of his room to announce herself, though the door was open and he could see her standing there quite clearly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, you’re leaving,” Heinrich said. His voice was weak, and she wanted to beg him to drink some water, but that wouldn’t have done any good in this conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did Eva tell you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re dressed to say goodbye,” he said. This was true. She was already wearing her coat and boots.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Heinrich,” she said, and came over to his side and sat down on the chair next to his bed. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” he said, though it clearly pained him to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If it’s any consolation, I didn’t plan it and keep it a secret. It was decided after you went to sleep last night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He rolled his head towards her, and forced a smile onto his face. “That may be true on a technical level, but you’ve been wanting to leave since you got here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have I really?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He laughed, which turned into a wheezing cough. “I’ve never met someone who’d rather be in the thick of things more than you,” he said. “I’m happy for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She picked up his limp hand and held it between hers. “You must want it more than me. I think you always talked so much about what you wanted to do— you rubbed off on me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want things I can’t have,” he said. “I’m glad you can have them in my stead. I’ll imagine you’re having the greatest time in the city, changing the world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure it won’t be anything that wonderful,” Hilde said. “Sieg says it’s been difficult in the city.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay well,” he said. “If it’s dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should be saying that to you,” she replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m a lost cause. You’re not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heinrich!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He twisted his lips in an approximation of a smile, though it made the sharp edges of his skull protrude even more. “It’s true, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t say things like that— you make me feel bad for leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What good would you do by staying? There’s nothing to be done for me except pray,” he said. “But since I’m the only one here who’s the praying type, I’ll have to spend all that effort on you.” He was very sincere, and it deflated anything she might have said if his tone had been wry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pressed his hand to her chin, resting her head on it. “Thank you,” she said. “I’ll stay safe. And I’ll be back to visit before any of our plans begin— Eva asked me to come back for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll look forward to it,” he said. “Don’t worry about me. I’ll be alright. Eva’s been good company. As long as you’re not stealing her away with you, I really have no right to complain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hank would say it’s a human right to complain, and you’ve got as much of it as anybody else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a good maxim. I’ll have to say some prayers for him, too, as thanks for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please,” Hilde said. “I think Hank’s doing alright, but maybe we can use all the help we can get.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Heinrich said with a smile. “You should get going. I wouldn’t want to make you late for the city.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re so eager to get rid of me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would be really cruel for me to tell you to stay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you’d listen to me, so you’d just have to feel bad about it the whole time you were gone. That would make everything worse, so I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed, and sniffled a little. “Stay well,” she said. “I’ll see you soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.” He squeezed her hand with as much strength as he could muster, which wasn’t much at all. “Good luck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.” She put his hand down on the blanket, patted it once in a meekly reassuring gesture, then headed for the door, rubbing her eyes though she wasn’t crying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she stepped out of the house into the driveway, she just stopped and looked around herself for a moment before she got into the car. She would be back, but she tried to fix in her mind the peaceful glistening snow on the pines, the dripping sound of it melting in the pale morning sun, and the clear blue sky overhead. She knew she was stupid to be leaving this place— even if nothing was wrong in the city, it was as idyllic as it could get, at least in its surroundings— but she saw Elfriede’s shadow pass across one of the windows on the lower floor, and an involuntary shudder crossed her. She passed it off as a shiver, but hastened to open the door of the car and drive away.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilde drove back to the city by herself, and she spent the entire journey ruminating. The further she drove from her cousin’s house, the stronger her relief grew to be away from it. Even aside from all the misery the house contained that she was escaping, she wanted to see Kircheis again. After everything they had done together, it felt almost unbearable to let him be alone in the city.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her thoughts turned around and around, trying to attack the problem that she and Kircheis had been assigned to think over. What distraction would keep Littenheim’s military police occupied enough that they wouldn’t notice an attack on Lichtenlade’s safehouse? Although Reuenthal had said that he was near certain that he had evaded detection by the MPs so far, Kircheis himself was under some kind of surveillance. This was why the distraction had been handed to him, since whatever he did— if he didn’t go to extreme efforts to hide his tracks— would draw the MPs like flies.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The problem was manpower, of course. Braunschweig’s forces remaining on Odin amounted to fewer than a hundred men, all currently dispersed and in hiding. It would be enough to take the Lichtenlade safehouse, since Elfriede had provided them with plenty of information about its security, but there wouldn’t be enough for anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The simplest thing would be some kind of act of terrorism. Between the two of them, Hilde was sure that they could rig bridges to explode, or find one of Littenheim’s storerooms and burn it to the ground. The trouble was that neither she nor Kircheis wanted to suggest anything that would be extreme enough to actually draw the MPs out in force. They were both somewhat wary of hurting the civilians in the capital city, who were already suffering a great deal of deprivation. The other problem with terrorism— and Kircheis could deny it, but it was true— was that it would almost certainly be fatal for the perpetrator, especially if it was being done specifically to draw the ire of the MPs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>More than anything, this was the reason that Hilde had asked Kircheis to let her come back to the city. She didn’t think that Kircheis </span>
  <em>
    <span>wanted</span>
  </em>
  <span> to put himself in danger, but if he was under pressure, and saw no other way, he might talk himself into it. There were things in this world worth dying for, Hilde thought, but a distraction was not likely to be one of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde left the car on a street in the suburbs, a ways away from the city itself, near to where one of her family’s servants’ families lived. She pulled her jacket tightly around herself, then began her long walk. There was a guarded border around the city, one that she didn’t want to try bringing a vehicle through, and she would have to meet Kircheis on the other side of it. The easiest crossing would be through a frosty little patch of greenbelt between two stretches of highway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The roads were completely empty, so she didn’t feel any hesitation in hopping over the barrier, jogging across the road, and ducking into the barren brambles in the center of the split highway. From there, she made her way through the trees, watching carefully to make sure no one spotted her as she crept past the small guard encampments on the road. She was well hidden by wood, and no one was paying attention to the greenbelt, so she made it past easily. When the two sides of the highway lifted up off the ground to join a bridge a little way down, Hilde slid down the snow covered slope of the greenway and ended up on familiar city streets. A little ways away was the park where she was supposed to meet Kircheis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was still the very outskirts of the city, and the park was completely empty. She passed the time sitting on some children’s swings with her bag in the snow near her feet. Even with just the watery noonday sun, the snow was beginning to melt, and for the first time in months, Hilde felt a stirring of hopefulness that this was almost over. She ran the math in her head— how long would it take for Hank’s ships to get from Iserlohn to Odin? A month or so. They might arrive before spring did, but spring was coming nevertheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wondered how Elizabeth was doing. The plan had always been to leave her in fortified Geiersburg, so that was likely where she was, with her mother. She was sure that Hank would have left them with enough ships and supplies to defend themselves, so she wasn’t exactly afraid of the idea of the Imperial fleets attacking, despite the order from the defeated Iserlohn forces. Although she wouldn’t want to be Elizabeth, trapped in a lonely fortress, Hilde still felt a pang of regret at not being allowed to accompany her. It was better that she was on Odin with Kircheis— but she couldn’t help but wonder about the alternative.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was shivering from how long she had been out in the snow, and her pants were all wet from tromping through the brush, but Kircheis finally pulled up. He was driving an unmarked pickup truck and had a woolen hat pulled down tightly over his ears. Before he could even get out of the car to help her with her meager luggage, she was already halfway inside, dragging her bag in after her and tossing it at her feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I cannot wait for spring,” she said by way of greeting, flopping back in her seat and luxuriating in the car’s warmth. She turned her head towards him and grinned— something about the situation and what she was doing suddenly striking her as funny. Kircheis’s face crinkled up in his usual beatific smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’ll come,” Kircheis said. “How was your drive— and getting into the city?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, it was fine,” she said. “I’ve just been thinking a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s hard not to do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’d be surprised,” Hilde said. “If you told me I couldn’t come here, I’d have to try to turn my brain off for the next month.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t have listened to me if I said that,” Kircheis said. “I don’t think you’re capable of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if that’s a compliment, Sieg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you been alright? I feel like we haven’t gotten a chance to really talk in ages.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll have plenty of time now,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well— tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want to know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was being evasive on purpose. “Have you seen Martin?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Spoken to him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, Sieg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” he said. “He made his choices.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe you,” Hilde said. “You haven’t really given up on him, have you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis was silent for a long time. In fact, Hilde wasn’t sure if he was going to answer at all, but she waited. “No,” Kircheis said. “I suppose I won’t, until I’m not given a choice about it.” He stared straight ahead of them down the road— empty of all cars, except for a few abandoned ones on the side of the street. “He just thinks I don’t have that choice anymore. I can’t change his mind about that. I can’t make him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They drove some more in silence. Hilde kept glancing over at Kircheis, wondering what he was thinking, but his face was quite impassive. Before they left the city’s outskirts, Kircheis glanced over at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure you want to come with me?” he asked. “I could tell you where the safehouses are instead, and how to get there without being noticed. You wouldn’t be under surveillance there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to stay with you,” Hilde said. “That’s why I came.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded, and they entered the city proper, moving from the vaguely industrial area into the region where shops and apartment buildings commingled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It looked very different than Hilde remembered, though the snow did a lot to disguise the worst of the damage. Some buildings had burned down, storefront windows had been shattered, but the biggest change was how empty everything felt. Much like Hilde, everyone who could leave the city had done so. Some people couldn’t pick up their entire lives, but enough could that it was very obvious how far the population of the city had shrunk. There were no stores open either, and so little reason for people to be out on the streets. The few people they saw, shoulders hunched and walking with a protective, scurrying gait, all stopped to watch their car go by— one of the few vehicles moving anywhere. They stared at the car with hostile gazes, and some put their hands inside their jackets, reaching for hidden weapons. The first time she saw someone do this, Hilde looked over at Kircheis, looking down his side, and she saw the noticeable bump at his hip beneath his jacket where he carried his own sidearm— the one he had been given by Hank.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Has it been bad in the city?” she asked. For some reason, she lowered her voice, though of course no one could hear them inside the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pretty bad,” Kircheis said. “There’s… not much food coming in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there any?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Some.” They came to an intersection, and he slowed the car to a crawl so that he could look around and decide which route to take. They were winding a very circuitous path through the city, following some intuition that only Kircheis had about where there was likely to be trouble. “There’s nothing coming in from space,” he said as he picked a direction and went off in it. “But there are still farms down south producing food— it’s just a matter of distribution. Minor nobility who own land on Odin— if they swear fealty to Littenheim he’s happy enough to use them and take their goods, if not, he’s happy to try to steal from them, if he can. But it’s easier to bomb a farm or a factory into nothing than it is to get it to produce for you.” He shook his head. “And what does make in— Littenheim doles it out as favors, or it’s smuggled in through the black market.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you had enough to eat?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, of course,” Kircheis said. “Braunschweig put plenty of supplies away, at least plenty for his agents on Odin. I wouldn’t have told you to come out here if you were going to starve with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde furrowed her brow. “It’s not like we haven’t done that together before,” she said, thinking about their several day trek across Castrop’s planet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis gave her a little smile, but didn’t say anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They parked a ways away from Kircheis’s apartment, leaving the car in the lowest level of a parking garage. Vandals had already come through here, and the security gate was smashed apart. Kircheis covered the car with a dirty tarp that had been stashed inside the dumpster Kircheis parked them next to. It was overflowing with old garbage, and Hilde’s shoes crunched over broken glass as she got out of the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that really going to deter anyone?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been lucky so far. But it’s alright. I just need a place to bring it that isn’t the safehouse. This is fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked together to Kircheis’s apartment. Now that they were outside in the streets, Hilde couldn’t help but assume the same wary posture as the other pedestrians they had seen. She looked around nervously, feeling like every upper story dark window might have someone unfriendly behind it. She didn’t really enjoy the feeling— she had always considered herself quite brave, and familiar with the city. She stuck close to Kircheis, and was relieved when they finally arrived at his house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stairwell up to Kircheis’s apartment was dark, except for the light that filtered in through the windows. There was no power in the building, and Hilde could see her breath rise in clouds. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have a solar panel on the roof,” Kircheis said, preempting any question, though she would have accepted any living condition. “It’s enough to live on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His apartment, despite how cold it was and the lack of lights on, was just like she remembered it, and she couldn’t help but smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Home, sweet home,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose I don’t need to give you the tour,” Kircheis said, but then he did anyway— giving her explanations of how he lived his life without running water (water to the building had been shut off to keep the pipes from freezing, and after that the city’s water supply had faltered in general), and where he kept all his food, and how to power the small hotplate from the battery connected to his rooftop solar panel, and how to stay warm in the cold house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis had erected a makeshift tent-like canopy over the top of his bed, to keep the warmth in, by pulling the tall bookshelves to either side of the bed, and draping layers of linens over the top— a plastic tarp and then bedsheets scavenged from who-knows-where, all safety pinned together to hold their shape. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I usually stay in here when I’m not busy with other things,” Kircheis said. “The ventilation’s not great, but it’s warm.” He held open the curtain of blankets so that she could get into the spacious bed, but she realized her pants were still soaking wet from crawling around in the snow. She pulled open her bag and discovered that her clothes, which had been wrapped around her computer to protect it, were not in much better shape. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hate to impose,” Hilde said, “but do you have anything dry I can wear?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re never an imposition,” he said. He smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes like it usually did. “You’re about Martin’s size. He left most of his winter things when he left in the spring.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Last spring… Has it really been that long already?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis didn’t answer— she hadn’t expected him to— but led her to the empty other bedroom. There were boxes of canned goods on the floor, and the bed had been stripped of linens so that Kircheis could use them for his tent. Kircheis bent down to look under the bed and pulled out a box of folded winter clothes: sweaters and heavy corduroy pants. Hilde picked up one off the top of the pile and hugged it to her chest. “Thanks,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> It hardly needed discussion, but Kircheis asked it anyway. “Do you want me to set up this room for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And make us both freeze? I don’t think so.” She gently tugged on Kircheis’s sleeve, and they left the empty bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she had changed into clothes that were at least dry, if not warm, she joined Kircheis on his bed, and although it was cozy and made her start yawning, they immediately got to work. She set her computer up in front of them, and he spread out a paper map across the bed, and they started to pick apart their options for a distraction in the capital in detail. Kircheis was more familiar with the state of the city than she was, since she had been away for so long, and he pointed out on the map all the major buildings that had already been destroyed, the bridges that had been toppled, and the infrastructure that had ceased to function.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde poked at the map where it indicated a block of power transformers. “Too bad power’s already down,” she said. “That would be my choice, if we had it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been thinking about that,” Kircheis said. “The city’s been cut off from power, but it’s all nuclear— the plant itself is still technically operational, as far as I know. It’s the transmission stations that have all been interrupted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde shivered, only half from residual chill. “And would there be a way to attack it without risking it getting out of hand? I don’t personally want to irradiate the entire city.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis looked off above her head. “The MPs have as much reason— or more— to stop that from happening,” he said. “We don’t actually need to cause damage— we just have to get them to come out to stop us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s suicide,” Hilde said pointedly. “The ideal distraction would be one where we create a problem that has to be dealt with after it’s happened, because that means whoever causes it can get out of the way, while still keeping the MPs occupied.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” He looked back down at the map and pointed at the airport on the edge of the city. “Littenheim’s parked all his remaining ships there, except for a few in the country. What about that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably the most heavily guarded place,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They discussed the merits of different targets for an hour or so, without coming any closer to a conclusion. When Hilde’s yawns grew too potent for even Kircheis to ignore, he stretched and said, “I should go run and get some water, and do my daily message exchange with Rear Admiral Reuenthal. Do you want to stay here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to come?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can come tomorrow. It’s not that interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you see the rear admiral, please tell him I said hello.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t,” Kircheis said. “I’m just going to a message cache.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are you getting water from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Littenheim’s soldiers bring it in trucks to a couple places around the city,” he said. “Otherwise, we’d be boiling river water, and there’d be riots.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eugh,” Hilde said. She almost asked where Littenheim was getting the water from, and if that would be a viable target, but then decided that attacking it would cause more problems for the city than it would solve. “Stay safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will,” Kircheis said. “We can have dinner when I get back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sounds good.” Hilde rolled up the map, shut her computer, and then laid back on the bed, pulling the blankets up around herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She listened as Kircheis collected the huge empty water jugs, shuffling all around the apartment. He yelled a goodbye to her when he left, and then an eerie silence descended. The whole building creaked and moaned in the wind. Perhaps all old buildings did, but Hilde had never been in Kircheis’s house alone before. The coziness of the canopy bed nevertheless was soothing, and so the unfamiliar sounds washed over her without stirring up any anxiety about being here, in the city.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She drifted in and out of consciousness for some time, not aware of how long it was. She never had been good at napping, and so she didn’t fall into a truly restful sleep. And whatever sleep she had managed to fall into was interrupted by the click of the lock on the front door, and the sound of heavy footsteps that most certainly did not belong to Kircheis. Kircheis moved quite delicately— these steps were thumping, with short strides. The intruder paced around the kitchen, as if intending to wake Hilde up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She cursed herself for not asking Kircheis if there was any other weapon in the house beside his sidearm. She thought that there must be, though peeking out through the curtains of the bed, she didn’t see anything. The door between the bedroom and the living room was also closed, another heat saving measure, so she couldn’t get a glimpse of the intruder. She crept out of the bed and gave as silent of a search of the room for a weapon as she could. She came up empty handed, not even finding anything suitable as a bludgeon. The only thing she had to hand was the long cable that emerged from the battery pack wired to the solar panel on the roof. She took it, holding it in both hands, hoping it might be useful as a garotte.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned the handle of the bedroom door silently, and looked out through the crack. The intruder was sitting at the kitchen table. He had helped himself to one of Kircheis’s cans of tuna, and was eating it with a fork directly from the can. Although he was facing away from Hilde, she could smell it. The man was in uniform— the uniform of the Military Police. He had taken off his hat and laid it on the table near his elbow, the eagle emblem glinting in the watery sunset light that was peeking its way through the kitchen window. At his side on the floor was a plain black messenger bag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde took a few steps forward, sliding her socked feet across the floor, trying not to breathe. She came within a meter of the man, and he made no indication that he had heard her coming until she raised her garrotte up, intending to lunge and strike, when he said, “Fraulein Mariendorf, are you aware that Lieutenant Kircheis leaves his spare key in his mailbox?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rear Admiral Bronner, though he also now only had a lieutenant’s stripes on his shoulders, turned around to face Hilde, who lowered, but didn’t unclench her hands from, her makeshift weapon. She had met Bronner at Leigh’s wedding, and had heard plenty about him from Kircheis besides that, but she didn’t exactly trust him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did he tell you to come here?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not. He’ll be very annoyed that I waited until he was gone to come and pay you a visit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s have a little chat, Fraulein,” Bronner said. He gestured magnanimously at one of the other chairs at the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you an MP now?” she asked. She circled to the other side of the table, but she didn’t sit down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m exactly the same as I ever was,” Bronner said. “A person who likes information.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t answer the question,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner’s face was expressive like a mask was expressive, the expression it carried perfectly selected for maximum effect. He smiled. “The basement I usually work out of has found itself occupied, and I found myself temporarily out of a job, along with all of my subordinates,” he said. “I decided that if I wanted to remain on stage, and keep getting fed, I should pick up an understudy role.” His whole countenance changed, and he adopted a countryside accent, of the kind that Hilde recognized from visiting her family’s estates. “And, of course, my lady, when the esteemed Marquis Littenheim came to Odin, he needed someone from his estates to settle in to the Military Police and make sure there weren’t some lingering troubles in that department, didn’t he?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You made up a job for yourself?” Hilde asked, somewhat incredulous. “And nobody’s caught you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner dropped the accent. “Of course they haven’t caught me. The MPs and Littenheim’s inner circle are all in complete chaos.” He laughed. “Even if they knew I was a fraud, I’m still more efficient than half the idiots over there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How nice to hear,” Hilde said. She stared him down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not as easy to bother as Leigh, are you?” Bronner asked. “Pity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like for you to tell me what you’re doing here in Sieg’s apartment— especially if you’re working for Littenheim— or Lichtenlade, if that’s who you’re spying on the MPs for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not working for anyone,” Bronner said. “Or, what was Leigh’s line— he’s working for the Empire’s people? So am I.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I find that very hard to believe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Bronner asked. “If you can believe it from Leigh, aren’t I a far better actor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Commodore Leigh isn’t a liar.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner let out a laugh— possibly the first genuine emotion he had ever expressed in his life. “That’s very funny.” But he looked at her straight on. “I’m offended that you don’t believe me. After all— Leigh was given to </span>
  <em>

  <span> after he returned from El Facil— and I am not stupid enough to not understand why he was banished from Admiral Merkatz’s tender care. I was supposed to reform him, for the good of this place. Find him a role where his particular talents could do well. And didn’t I? Didn’t I at every single step of the way give him opportunities to succeed, didn’t I vouch for him when he needed it, didn’t I keep him out of harms way when he could have fallen into the darkness? Didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know why you did,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bronner briefly narrowed his eyes, then shook his head. “It doesn’t matter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stared at each other from across the table. “What do you want?” Hilde finally asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I came to give you some information, since your friend Lieutenant Kircheis seems reluctant to do anything with the information I have given him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From his messenger bag, Bronner drew a sheaf of papers. On the top was a photograph— in color, but the scene was so bleak that it almost appeared black and white. The picture showed naked corpses, all men, all ghastly pale and frozen, scattered across the dark asphalt of the highway. Behind them, blocking the road, were the shattered remnants of a road barricade, along with the burnt out husks of several vehicles. Darker smudges of burned rubber remained on the road, showing where someone had whipped their cars into motion. Hilde looked at the photo, trying to recognize any of the dead men.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not the only one who’s stealing uniforms,” Bronner said, after she had looked at the photo for a moment. “And weapons, and trucks full of Littenheim’s food supply, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin did that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At least some of Herr Bufholtz’s companions, yes. They’re probably going to use the uniforms to grab more trucks, but I also am certain that they’re planning something much larger, and soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I watch them, as much as I’m able,” Bronner said. “Unfortunately, they’ve made a crucial error.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Which is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“By attacking the MPs directly, it’s no longer just </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span> who is forced to care about them,” Bronner said. “And don’t jump to the conclusion that I’ve simply reported what I know. I haven’t,” he said. “My information is my own. But someone other than me will be looking for them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do you want me— or Sieg— to do with this information?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want the capital to become a scorched wasteland,” Bronner said. For once, his unflinching gaze broke, and he looked out the window at the sunset. “I think the conditions are right for it. Here, Littenheim is starving everyone who isn’t his personal friend. Out in the universe, the scattered Imperial forces are— I’m sure— going to start attacking the lands of Braunschweig’s allies, if they don’t think they can get to Odin. Everyone who heard it knows what that last order from the Iserlohn fleet meant. The people who are suffering from all that aren’t soldiers, aren’t nobility. People are angry, and it would not take much to set this city off, and the rest of the Empire with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t stop Martin,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t expect that you could.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what is it that you want?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want this to end before it spreads,” Bronner said. “I want the MPs to take care of it before it can get out of hand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this really what you think Commodore Leigh wants?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not,” Bronner said. “I’m aware that he’s a republican. He’d be sympathetic to your friend’s cause.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why do you come here pretending like you’re helping him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am helping him,” Bronner said. “It pains me that you don’t see it, Fraulein. </span>
  <em>
    <span>If</span>
  </em>
  <span> your friend Herr Bufholtz is in any way successful here on Odin, that only means that it will become Duke Braunschweig’s— and Leigh’s— responsibility to cut him down later. It is far, far better to have this rebellion put down by Littenheim’s men, so that when Elizabeth takes the throne, her hands are clean of the trouble.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Commodore Leigh wouldn’t—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if he didn’t, Braunschweig would kill him when he refuses that order,” Bronner said. “I agree that Leigh would have a difficult time putting down a republican rebellion. And that would be the end of him. I, personally, would prefer that not to happen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if Martin wins?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He probably won’t win here against Littenheim, and he certainly wouldn’t win against Braunschweig. It’s not a question of Herr Bufholtz winning. It’s a question of how many other people he drags onto the funeral pyre with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The power cable, still in Hilde’s hands, was wrapped tightly enough around her palms that she had lost circulation in her fingers. Bronner was right, but she hated to admit it. She could see why all of Bronner’s visits to Kircheis had been in vain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why do you think that I can do anything about it?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“With the MPs turning more of their focus on Herr Bufholtz’s activities, my ability to watch them is going to become even more constrained than it already has been.” He flipped through his stack of papers and handed Hilde a photograph of a nondescript industrial building, some of the windows shattered. There was an address written in pencil below. “This is where they’re currently located, but they move about once a week, and spread out their leadership across a couple different buildings, just in case.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde hesitated, then took the photo.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want the day and the hour,” Bronner said. “Whatever time they’re planning to make their move, and what move it is they’re planning to make. Find that out for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Martin is my friend,” Hilde said. “Even if you’re right, I don’t know why you think I would betray him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“People have always managed to find their reasons,” Bronner said. “That’s a very old story. Maybe the oldest. Goodday, Fraulein Mariendorf.” Bronner stood, picked up his hat and settled it on his head. Beneath it was the spare key to Kircheis’s house. “You might want to put that back in his mailbox. Or keep it for yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde scowled at him, and he left through the front door.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kircheis returned about an hour later, hauling the full water jugs up the steps of the apartment. Hilde offered to help, but he just waved her off. She did at least help him assemble dinner from the stash of canned goods, though her hand kept going to the spare key in the pocket of her pants. They sat down at the table to eat their feast (canned corn, fried up slices of tinned ham, and coffee,) and Kircheis pulled out the letter he had picked up from his message exchange point. He passed it to her, saying, “Captain Oberstein wants to meet with you in a couple days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me? What for?” Hilde asked. She skimmed the letter that had been left for Kircheis— it didn’t say much other than that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis gave a sympathetic smile. “I would assume he wants to lecture you, and ask how our plans for a distraction are coming. I’ll come with you,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, that’s fine, you don’t have to,” Hilde said. “I’m happy to talk to Captain Oberstein— I only met him for the first time at Hank’s wedding. Will Oskar be there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably not.” Kircheis pointed at Oberstein’s personal signature on the bottom of the note. “Rear Admiral Reuenthal doesn’t object to you being here, as far as I know, so I guess there’s no reason for him to want to meet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does Captain Oberstein object?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know why he would.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Hilde said. “Is it safe to go meet him? With the apartment being watched, anyway?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Kircheis said. “Our meeting spot is outside the city, and it’s pretty easy to be sure you’re not followed if you’re outside the city limits.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure you don’t want me to come?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Captain Oberstein wants to make sure I’m not being a burden to you, having you come with me would do the opposite of reassure him,” she said. “It’s fine, Sieg. I’m capable of going to a meeting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence between them. Hilde clutched the spare key in her pocket so hard that the ridges dug into her fingers, and then she steeled herself and pulled it out, placing it on the table between them. A flash of instant recognition crossed Kircheis’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rear Admiral Bronner also wanted to meet me,” Hilde said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Kircheis stared at the key, and didn’t say anything more than that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did he also ask you to tell him when Martin is going to make his moves?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Kircheis said. “But I don’t know why he thinks that I can do that. I haven’t spoken to Martin for a long time.” There was something off in Kircheis’s voice, though.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably for the best,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did he say anything else to you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not really,” Hilde said. “He tried to convince me, but that was it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He really thinks—” There was a momentary flash of real anger in Kircheis’s voice and expression, one that Hilde had never heard or seen before. He stifled it before he finished his sentence, but it was enough to be alarming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sieg—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kircheis collected himself. “Even if I marched myself up to Martin’s hideout, he wouldn’t tell me. Bronner knows that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know that for sure,” Hilde said. “I think you </span>
  <em>
    <span>could </span>
  </em>
  <span>convince him to tell you, or find out. Martin— loves you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, he doesn’t,” Kircheis said. And he said it with such finality that Hilde couldn’t argue. Perhaps Kircheis was right. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde looked down at the key. “Have you reported what Bronner has said to Captain Oberstein and Rear Admiral Reuenthal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” he said. “Enough that they know what Bronner has been doing. None of us trust him, but there’s no reason for me to stop talking to him, in case he does say something useful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde hesitated. “Does Hank trust him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” he said with a frown. “But he trusts far too many people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That rang true, but it had been the wrong thing for him to say. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde found herself thinking about it that night, long after Kircheis had turned off the single dangling lamp hung in his tented area, and they had both settled down to sleep. Kircheis’s breath was irregular in his dreams, and the calmness he maintained when awake didn’t keep him from tossing and turning at night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wouldn’t have said she pitied him, but that was the emotion she felt watching him thrash against his nightmares. She wished that there was something she could do to relieve him of his burden, but she felt suddenly like an outsider, even as she curled up at his side. He couldn’t— or wouldn’t— share anything he really felt. She thought about his uncharacteristic momentary anger, and how quickly he had choked it down, and she thought about the pain in his voice when he talked about Martin’s love. Perhaps he thought it went without saying that he loved Martin still, or perhaps he simply didn’t want to say it to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why had Bronner come to her? Was she really weak enough to be convinced by his arguments, where Kircheis wasn’t? Or was it the other way around?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled the blankets up around her chin, and a terrible thought began to form in her mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilde went to meet with Oberstein two days later, out in the countryside. Their scheduled meeting time was early in the morning, which went against her instincts for clandestine encounters. She reassured Kircheis once again that she didn’t need an escort and went by herself, though she did take a gun with her. She was hyper-aware of it at her hip beneath her coat. In her nondescript clothing, she felt just like every other hunched-shoulder pedestrian when she walked the city streets, quickly trying to get to her destination without letting trouble follow her. She made it out of the city without problems, sneaking past the guarded border just as the weak winter sun was coming up over the tops of the buildings. She navigated to the address of an abandoned house, and inside the garage found a car waiting for her, which she drove most of the remaining distance. Even though the car itself wasn’t followed— the roads were empty as far as her eye could see— she was still paranoid enough to leave it a mile from the meeting place, and trudge the rest of the way through the snow on foot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They met in a convenience store, one whose shelves had all been stripped completely bare. The windows and doors hadn’t been broken— either the proprietor had cleared the place out before there was any risk of looting, or any thieves had simply entered through the door, as Oberstein had. Hilde didn’t know if or how he had unlocked it, but it was propped open when she arrived. An aging Dalmatian greeted her at the door, wagging its tail with the sluggish enthusiasm of an old man. Kircheis had told her what to expect, so she scratched its head in greeting and called out, “Captain Oberstein, I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dog led her to a tiny back room, one with a table and chairs presumably for the employees to eat their lunches at. There were old workplace posters stuck up on the walls, and there was a frozen brick of old coffee in the carafe of the machine on the counter. Oberstein sat at the table. Although he was wrapped in a heavy coat, it didn’t make him appear any larger than he was, and his bony wrists showed in between where his leather gloves ended and his woolen sleeves began.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde saluted at the doorway, and the dog wandered away from her to press its head into Oberstein’s side. Oberstein nodded, but did not return her salute. “Good morning, Fraulein Mariendorf.” He had a nasal voice, and no expression on his face whatsoever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning, sir,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gestured for her to take a seat, and she did. From her bag, she pulled out all the preliminary material she had put together with Kircheis, which currently amounted to a few proposed plans about bombing the nuclear power station outside the city, or attacking the airfield where Littenheim’s ships were sitting. Neither of the plans were ones that Hilde liked, but they had very few options available. She shuffled them around for a moment as she asked, “What did you want to discuss with me, sir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you come up with a plan for a diversion?” Oberstein asked, cutting directly to the point. “When I last spoke to Lieutenant Kircheis, he expressed hope that your presence would be beneficial. Additionally, Commodore Leigh has spoken highly of your abilities. I would like to know if we have the issue settled, so that Rear Admiral Reuenthal and I can finalize our own part in this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was somewhat relieved that this appeared to be a straightforward test from Oberstein, though she wasn’t satisfied with any of the plans she had on hand. “I’m glad to hear that Commodore Leigh is confident in me, sir. I hope that I live up to your expectations,” she said. “Lieutenant Kircheis and I have been working on it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oberstein nodded again, and she laid out her plans on the table. “There are two major approaches that we’ve considered. Both of them have their downsides,” she said. She launched into a description of both plans. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oberstein listened impassively, though he pointed out the flaws in the plans before Hilde could bring them up. She agreed with him that it would be difficult to coordinate the destruction of the ships, though that would be the better target. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The power plant is a softer target,” Oberstein said. “But I would like to maintain infrastructure where possible. When Braunschweig arrives to take control, he will prioritize keeping necessities functioning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde looked into Oberstein’s shiny, false eyes for a moment. “Will he, sir? Or will Commodore Leigh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The latter, though the difference is immaterial at this moment,” Oberstein said. “I believe it is in everyone’s best interests to keep Commodore Leigh’s goals aligned with Duke Braunschweig’s until the end of the civil war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were those the only avenues that you are pursuing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde hesitated, then said, “Captain Oberstein— has Lieutenant Kircheis told you about Rear Admiral Bronner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Oberstein said. “He’s mentioned his position within the Military Police. A useful source of information, perhaps.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did Lieutenant Kircheis tell you what he wants?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I advised the Lieutenant that even if he could be assured of positive results, which he cannot be, it would not be worth wasting his efforts infiltrating a rebel cell. It would be of little use to us, since they are unlikely to be our allies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you ask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hesitated again. “Rear Admiral Bronner wanted us to find out the time when that group will be making their move. I assume it will be fairly soon. It just struck me that since this is going to be happening regardless, and will be a distraction to the MPs, that we might take advantage of whatever it is that they’re going to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stared her down, and she could see the glinting red traces of circuitry beneath the colored glass of his artificial eyes. “We would not be able to plan without a date,” Oberstein said. “We cannot have our plan resting on chance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could get a date,” Hilde said. “I might need to offer them something. But I could get it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And this is not because Lieutenant Kircheis wants to help them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir,” she said. If Kircheis knew she had mentioned this to Oberstein at all— she wondered if he would be furious. What would that flash of anger look like directed at her? She steeled herself to face it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oberstein studied her face for a moment, then nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilde didn’t have too much time. If Kircheis thought her meeting with Oberstein had run too long, he would start to be worried about her failure to reappear at home. She didn’t want that to happen, but she nevertheless had a mission to accomplish.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Back inside the city, she made her way to the address that Bronner had provided. She went there on foot, and waited across the street, lingering in the stairwell on the street that descended into the basement storefront level. It gave her a decent vantage point while remaining unseen. She didn’t think she could wait long, and she kept checking her watch to judge how long she could go before she needed to get back to Kircheis. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The broken windows had been boarded up with plywood, so she couldn’t tell how many people were inside, or what level of the building they were on, but here seemed to be plenty of people coming and going from the house, though this would only be apparent to someone like her, watching every movement near the grey stone building. People came and went one at a time, about every ten minutes or so, alternating which exits they used, and all dispersing in different directions. She didn’t recognize any of them, though she squinted into the dim winter sunlight and studied their faces carefully. The majority were young, her age, and there were more men than women.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was on the verge of giving up her stakeout when Martin emerged, finally. It had been nearly a year since she had last seen him, and although he looked different— leaner, with close cropped hair and an ill-fitting jacket— she still recognized him easily. It was something about the way he walked. Even though he adopted the same careful lookout for trouble as every other person in the city, he still moved loosely, his arms dangling and his step light. After the momentary elation of finding her target, Hilde found herself angry at him on Kircheis’s behalf. She tried to shake off the feeling as she crept out of her hiding place and followed Martin. It wouldn’t be useful to yell at him; she needed to make a deal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He walked quickly, but she kept pace, gaining on him until he realized he had a pursuer, and then he broke into a run, dodging down an alleyway. Hilde barreled after him. Of the two, she was the more athletic, though he was more familiar with this area of the city. She chased him for a minute, until his stamina began to flag. She had cornered him in an alley, him standing far in the back near the dumpsters, unable to find a way out, and she silhouetted in the entrance. Martin turned towards her and reached inside his jacket for his gun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde held up her hands, even as he pointed the weapon (Kircheis’s gun, she remembered) at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Been a while, Martin,” she said. “Put the gun down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde?” he asked. He didn’t lower his weapon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who else would it be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you were in the countryside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would you think that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Mariendorf estate is empty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m staying with Sieg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since when?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you go by his apartment to check who’s there often?” she asked. “You know he still keeps his spare key in the mailbox for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin’s mouth opened silently, but he shut it quickly, getting control of the momentary emotion that had crossed his face. Still, it was enough for Hilde to take pity on him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been there since last week,” she said. “We’re—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Planning to take the crown?” he asked. The sneer in his voice frustrated her once again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Braunschweig doesn’t have enough people on the planet for that,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know you’re being watched, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll be out of this place in a day or two.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde shook her head. “Won’t help. What you did at the city limits the other day has gotten you much more attention.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin stiffened. “I don’t care.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll care when—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to talk about this,” he said. “You shouldn’t have come here.” He stuffed the gun back into his pocket, and tried to shoulder his way out of the alley past her. Hilde grabbed his arm, and he tried to slip out of his jacket to get away. But she wouldn’t let him go, despite his efforts. She grabbed both of his arms behind his back and hauled him into the alley.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re going to talk,” she said. “Since Sieg can’t, it’s my job to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me go.” He tried again to pull himself out of her grip, but she didn’t let him go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t we friends?” Hilde asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me go,” he said again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just want to talk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine. Don’t run.” She released him, and he turned around to scowl at her, but didn’t try to get past her, perhaps because he knew how futile it was. Up close, she could see how much weight he had lost— and he hadn’t had much extra on his frame to lose to begin with. He was quite gaunt. It was no wonder it had been easy for her to outrun and then grab him. There was a granola bar in her pocket, one she had been saving to eat for lunch. She held it out to him as a peace offer. He took it, but didn’t eat it, and instead put it in his own pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eat it,” she demanded. “I’m giving it to you, not to your commune.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can see this conversation you want isn’t going to go very well,” Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s one granola bar. Not exactly easy to share. Come on, Martin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled, but didn’t take the snack out of his pocket. “I’ll eat it later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde just shook her head. “I should tell Sieg that he should be more worried about you starving yourself to death than getting shot by Littenheim’s MPs.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He shouldn’t worry about me,” Martin said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He does.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin scowled and looked away. “It’s a waste of his energy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will do you the favor of not telling him that you said that,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was silent for a moment. “What do you want?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need to tell you something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure I want to hear it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’ll help you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I doubt it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde stared at him. “You’re planning to do something spectacular soon, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going to answer that question.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright. I don’t care if you do or not. I know it’s true.” She fished in her bag for her sheaf of papers, and pulled out the top sheet that showed the satellite view of the airfield where Littenheim’s ships were parked. She held it out to Martin, who took it warily. “Braunschweig needs to get rid of Littenheim’s ships,” she said. “Sieg and I are responsible for figuring out how to do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why does that matter to me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“March fifteenth,” she said, picking a date that she thought could work. “Eight at night. If that changes, I’ll let you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin looked her in the eyes. “Why are you telling me this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was easy to lie about that, because the lie was true. “Because I don’t want you to die,” she said. “Whatever you’re planning, do it then. The MPs will be distracted. It gives you… a better chance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you.” He could have said that with venom, but he didn’t. She was grateful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” she said. “I won’t pretend it doesn’t. But you need the luck more than we do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does Sieg know you’re here telling me this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she said. “He’s probably wondering where I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you tell him that you’ve made this offer to me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde hesitated. “Should I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Martin didn’t seem able to answer, so Hilde just held out her hand to him. He took it. Despite the boniness of his hand, he was feverishly warm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We are still friends,” she said. “Don’t think we’re not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good luck,” he said finally.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded, and let him go.</span>

  <em>
    <span>February 489 I.C., Odin</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena and Eva went on long walks through the woods to firm up their plans, far from any listening ears. The snow had fallen from the tree branches, but the ill-kept paths through the woods, little more than deer trails, were still covered in a muddy slush. Magdalena stomped through it, heedless of the dampness getting into her fur-lined boots. Eva was a little more delicate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll have to ask the Earth Church for help,” Magdalena said, sounding quite annoyed by it, though she announced it with her usual practicality. “You and I can’t really do anything by ourselves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought that you said they had already surrounded Erwin Josef in Neue Sanssouci,” Eva said. “Why haven’t they done anything yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh— I’m sure Lichtenlade knew that none of the palace staff could be trusted. That place was always a den of servants being paid off by someone or other. He took Erwin Josef with his own staff, to his own estate. And he must have been pretty smart about it, too. The Earth Church probably doesn’t know where they are, or they would have done something already. But if we give them their location, they can help us get him out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not,” Magdalena said. “I don’t trust them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The only thing I know about them is from Heinrich,” Eva said. “They seem alright to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They made Ingrid into their tool. I don’t trust them not to do the same to Erwin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there any way to stop that from happening?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want him to just disappear into the abyss.” She bit her lip. “We can’t just give them any information about how to rescue him— you have to make yourself essential to them, so they can’t operate without you. When you go into the house to get him, you have to be the only one who knows where it would be. And you’ll have to keep watch over him when you go. You can’t let him out of your sight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva nodded. The full scope of what she had agreed to do was beginning to form in her mind: the blank check she had given Magdalena would be cashed to its fullest extent. The idea didn’t trouble her as much as it should have. There was a strange comfort in being asked to find the limits of her own abilities. She imagined this was the feeling that Wolf had, when he went into battle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was quiet for a second as she thought about it. Finally, she asked,  “You won’t come with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena looked distraught. “I can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?” Her voice was strangely calm, even though she shivered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nobody can know that this is what we’re doing,” Magdalena said. “And you’re the only one who has an excuse to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have an excuse to leave?” It took a moment for what Magdalena was saying to truly sink in, so she repeated the words wonderingly, like a parrot, as their meaning took form.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena stopped and looked at her. The noonday sun was weak through the branches of the pines, and Eva pulled her coat even more tightly around herself. “You do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena hastily turned away. “I can’t tell it to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course I know,” Magdalena said bitterly. “Everybody knows. Everybody knows except you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” On some level, she had understood this, but it was difficult to hear it said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long have you known?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Forever,” Magdalena said. “Since before I met you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That long…” It was very strange to get confirmation that the secret of Wolf’s somehow predated her marriage. How something that old could give her an excuse to leave him, she didn’t understand. But it must be terrible, if he hadn’t told her yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked in silence for a few minutes. “Why can’t you tell me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva looked at Magdalena, who was biting her lip, scraping off the waxy red chapstick she was wearing with her teeth, leaving a pink sliver of bare flesh where her teeth drew across. Did she want to know? It was impossible to say. She might be able to demand that Magdalena tell her right now, but she hesitated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t tell you, because you have to make Elfriede tell you,” Magdalena said after a moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She knows too?” The words felt flat as they came out of her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oskar knows— she probably knows too, or at least she knows enough to find something horrible to say to you. She’s that kind of person.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He can keep a secret, can’t he?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not this kind. Not from her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does that mean?” She felt like a child.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t make me tell you,” Magdalena said. “Elfriede has to tell you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have to be surprised by it— you have to make her believe this is the reason you’re leaving. There’s no reason for her to lie about that to anyone who asks. She has to be the one. And if we can do it in front of witnesses, even better.” She tried to inject some humor into her voice, but it didn’t work. “You’re not a good enough actor to fake surprise, darling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” Magdalena said, and then again, much more sincere, “I’m so sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you apologizing for? It’s not your fault.” Even though this was true, and she was saying it to comfort Maggie, the words came out dull. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if it was?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t hate me too much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re scaring me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Magdalena just shook her head and was silent again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do I get Elfriede to tell me?” Eva asked. She shoved what it was out of her mind, focused on the essentials. After all, it wasn’t as if anything had changed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have to say something about her,” Magdalena said. “A secret she doesn’t want you to know. A fair trade.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know anything about her,” Eva said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I do. I used to love her, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva looked over at Magdalena, who was staring up into the grey-cloud sky above. “No,” she said, and another strange shiver passed through her. “No, I didn’t know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eva argued back and forth with Magdalena about Heinrich’s trustworthiness. Eva wanted to include him in the plan because he was their sole current connection to the Earth Church, and it would be very strange for one of them to corner his priest on his way out the door— strange enough that Elfriede might notice that something was going on. But Magdalena didn’t know Heinrich very well, and didn’t want to involve anyone else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva won the argument. She was surprised at how easily Magdalena capitulated. All Eva said was, “I’m going to speak with him,” and Magdalena’s resistance collapsed into little more than a huff of breath and a wave of a hand. She was startled by this power she seemed to now possess: once she decided to do something, doing things became the easiest thing in the world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so she found herself in Heinrich’s room, a letter tucked into her dress pocket for him to give to his priest. He was asleep when she entered, but she sat down by the side of his bed anyway and just watched the rise and fall of his chest. He was very peaceful when he was asleep, and she didn’t want to wake him. There wasn’t any rush.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps it was the sound of her breathing and movement that woke him, but he woke after a few minutes, blinking and squinting into the light, his face contorting in a grimace with the pain that haunted him when he was awake. Eva poured him some water from the pitcher on the bedside table and held it out for him to take and drink before she spoke. His arms shook, and he spilled some on himself, but he drank nevertheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning, Heinrich,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you waiting for me to wake up for long?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not long. How are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled and did not answer the question. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Eva had spent quite some time thinking about how she would broach the question, now that she was sitting at his bedside, it was tremendously difficult for her to bring it up. Instead, she stood and walked over to the bookshelf. She pulled down the well worn book of paintings and flipped through it, stopping on “Christina’s World” as the crease in the spine dictated. She stared down at it, though it only served to make her sad. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is something wrong, Eva?” Heinrich asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Eva said. Then, “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Has anyone told you what my husband’s secret is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You haven’t mentioned it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know very much at all.” His face twisted. “Nothing much beyond the corners of this room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wondered if Maggie might have told you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You forget that you’re the only one who pays me any mind,” Heinrich said. “May I ask what the secret is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see.” When she said nothing, he continued. “What’s making you think about it now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>keep a secret, Heinrich?” She looked over at him, and their eyes met.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To the grave,” he said. The tone in his voice indicated that he didn’t think that would be very far. But he was earnest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t say that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She closed the book, but didn’t put it down, and went back to sit next to his bedside. He smiled up at her, his thin and chapped lips pulled up over his teeth. She took his hand in hers. “I’m going to do something terrible, I think,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Terrible for whom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You,” Eva said. “So I’m very sorry about that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me?” Heinrich asked. “I didn’t realize you were planning to kill me for my inheritance. It seems like it’s a very hasty thing to do. My will is in the vault in the basement— you’ll have to edit it first.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was too sad to either scold him for the joke or play along. Instead she just pressed his hand to her cheek. “I’m leaving, Heinrich.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Today?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No— I don’t know when. Soon, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before your husband gets back?” he asked. He pulled his hand away from her face, his waxy fingers slipping out of hers to land on the bed with a feather-light thump. She suddenly understood that the tone in his voice, soft but undeniable, was jealousy. He was looking away, out the window. Something about that realization made her stomach turn, though she couldn’t place the sick feeling: pity or anger, maybe. It was an unfamiliar feeling for her, and she pulled her hands back to her lap, an invisible wall springing up between them. She looked down at her skirt, and she noticed her wedding ring— such a permanent fixture of her hand that she rarely thought about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” she said. “Before then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I ask where you’re going?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She almost changed her mind, almost told him the lie that would be delivered to Elfriede and everyone else. But that would have been cruel for no reason. He was jealous of her marriage, and perhaps she had accidentally encouraged that feeling by spending so many hours with him, alone, the only real company he had in years. Hadn’t she done that because he was human? Perhaps she had forgotten that jealousy was just as human of an emotion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The rebel territories,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not even Phezzan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not running away from my husband.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why did you mention him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to tell everyone that’s what I’m doing, but I’m not,” she said. She paused, suddenly not sure how to explain. Heinrich gave her time to compose herself. “It feels so strange to say out loud— you’ll think I’m crazy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t.” His simple earnesty reassured her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Erwin Josef,” she said finally. “His mother was Maggie’s friend. And if no one gets him away from Odin, he’s going to die. Maggie— I can’t let that happen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you and Countess Leigh are going to do something?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she said. “Just me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.” He was still looking out the window. “Thank you for telling me.” The jealousy in his voice was even stronger now, but the source of this was easily understood, and perhaps just as easily ameliorated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need your help,” she said. “That’s why I’m telling you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My help?” There was hope in his voice, but by the end of his next sentence he crushed it. “If it’s money you need, you can have it. Or secrets… I can keep a secret.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What, then?” He rolled his head to face her at last, and she pulled her letter from the pocket of her dress. When she held it out to him, her hand trembled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you pass on a message to the right people?” she asked. “The Earth Church helped Erwin Josef’s mother escape— they might be able to help me now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heinrich took the letter and stared at it. “If that’s all I can do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s vital,” she said. “Please, Heinrich.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I will. I’ll make sure the right person gets it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.” The relief in her voice was powerful, and it made Heinrich smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish I could help you more.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re helping more than you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded, but turned away again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll pray for me when I’m gone,” Eva said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not a believer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. But—” Her voice broke. “I’m glad you’ll be thinking of me. Someone who knows the truth, who won’t think badly of me for going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded, but was quiet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m worried Wolf will never forgive me for leaving like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to tell him the truth?” She wondered, briefly, if it cost him anything to offer that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she said. “That would be worse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to come back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As soon as I can,” she said. “I don’t know how soon that will be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a long way to the other side of the galaxy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were both silent for a long time. This was natural for both of them, well used to contemplative time spent side by side, but it was heavier than it had once been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t go alone,” Heinrich said after some time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have whoever the Earth Church sends with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even then— don’t go alone. I don’t want you to get hurt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have anyone else to bring with me. Maggie can’t come, and I don’t… there’s no one else.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heinrich thought about it for a long time. She could see the gears turning in his mind, the way his eyes flicked upwards and his lips moved without sound, like he was reading a list of names, reciting a litany of saints. “Count Landsberg,” he finally said. “He would go with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva balked. “I hardly know him. And he’s Maggie’s friend— if she thought he should be involved, she would have asked him already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s a good man,” Heinrich said. “He would make sure you’re safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know why he would agree to get involved in a thing like this!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The same reason I would,” Heinrich said. “It’s an important thing to do. He wants to make his mark on the world, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Eva said. “I wouldn’t want him to get hurt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want you to get hurt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Maggie wouldn’t want anyone unnecessary involved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A man and a woman with a child looks safer, less easy to take advantage of, than a woman alone,” Heinrich said. “It will help you, especially if you’re in disguise. Consider it, please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva’s reluctance came not only from the practical considerations of involving someone else in the plan, but also from the distrust she had at the momentary soaring of her heart at the offer of help. She had been asked to carry this burden, and she was ashamed at how much she wanted to put it down, to pass it off to someone else, to ask him to protect her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll think about it. Maggie won’t be happy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll speak to him myself,” Heinrich said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was an uncharitable thought that flitted across her mind: it certainly would make her excuse of leaving the planet to escape her husband better, if she was seen fleeing with another man. It would make it that much harder for Wolf to forgive her, when she returned. She looked down into Heinrich’s eyes, wondering if that was the reason that he suggested it. She didn’t ask that, though. Instead, she asked, “Will you wait for me to come back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He let out a sigh, though his lungs were so pitifully small it was more like a wheeze. “Don’t make me answer that question, Eva,” he said. “I don’t like to lie to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was March before Hilde returned, as she promised that she would. The snow had fully vanished after a warm front of a few days, but then the temperature plummeted far below freezing once again, the winter unwilling to relinquish their part of Odin. Without the glittering white blanket on the landscape, the whole world was the grey of bare tree branches and frozen mud. When Hilde arrived in time for dinner, the warm headlights of her car were the only things that pierced the gloom, and the bulky red sweater she wore as she emerged from the vehicle was the only color around. There wasn’t even the bright hair of Herr Kircheis: Hilde had come alone. Eva waved to Hilde out the window as she walked up to the house, and then sat back down and waited.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The three women and Heinrich were all in their separate corners of the house, and Hilde made her rounds, paying each one a visit individually before dinner. Eva was in the parlor, listening to music and knitting, or at least trying to. Out the window, she had seen the car pull up in the driveway, and a cold fear had settled across her at what it meant. There was no other reason for Hilde to be here other than to warn them that the plans of those in the capital were about to be played out. There was no more time for Eva to think about what she was doing as a hypothetical. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde found Magdalena and Elfriede first, and then stuck her head into the parlor to greet Eva.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva’s hands were shaking on her knitting needles, and she wasn’t looking at her project (a shawl). She could feel herself dropping stitches, and if Wolf’s mother had seen her jerky movements and the way her project was unraveling beneath her touch, she would have stopped her and scolded her immediately, and taken the half-made shawl onto her own lap to fix the destroyed row. But Hilde simply sat down in the chair across from Eva with a fixed smile, and her eyes glanced over Eva’s project without comprehending the state that it was in. Hilde didn’t know how to knit. What a blessing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Eva,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome back— am I the last stop on your tour of the house, since you’re sitting down?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heinrich will have to be,” Hilde said. “I looked in his room, but he was asleep. Isn’t he usually awake to eat dinner, at least?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Usually,” Eva said. “But he was having a rough day, so I convinced him to take a painkiller a few hours ago. He’ll probably wake up later, at least for a little while, so he can eat something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It smells delicious in here,” Hilde said, commenting on the chicken and potatoes that one of the servants was roasting for dinner. “I didn’t realize when I left how terrible the food would be in the capital.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you had enough to eat?” Eva asked. It was easy to let genuine worry into her voice. “And Herr Reuenthal, and Herr Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, of course,” Hilde said. “We just can’t cook much— Sieg only has a one burner hotpot. It’s all canned beans and things like that, but I haven’t been hungry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good.” Eva smiled. “You’ve been gone for a while. That must be a lot of beans you’ve eaten.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should have counted them one by one,” Hilde said. “I’d report the number to you, if I knew it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva laughed. “I’m glad you’ve been well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well enough.” Some of what was clearly false cheer in Hilde’s voice broke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are things with Herr Kircheis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh—” Hilde looked away. “I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t you staying with him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Hilde said. “He’s— it’s fine. We had an argument.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to talk about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not really,” Hilde said. “I’ve apologized to him already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“These things happen to everyone,” Eva said. “I always felt terrible whenever Wolf and I had some kind of little fight. But if you love each other—” She broke off abruptly, a hard lump rising in her throat, which was perhaps for the best, because the expression on Hilde’s face was very strange.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde cleared her throat. “Are you alright, Eva?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I’m fine,” she said, but her smile was thin. “I just miss Wolf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They won at Iserlohn, so I’m sure he’s fine. He’ll be back soon,” Hilde said. “If he’s part of the force sent to Odin— which I think he would be, since he has ground combat experience— he should be here soon. I don’t know when, exactly, but soon.” Talking about practical things caused an immediate change in her tone and posture: her voice became assured and hard, and she sat up straight. It was clear just how many thoughts were hidden behind her eyes, and how much of Hilde was far away, thinking about the fate of the whole galaxy, rather than the petty problems of their small household.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume that means you and Herr Reuenthal will be making your move soon?” Eva asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The night of the fifteenth,” Hilde said. “I did promise to come warn you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is soon. I appreciate you keeping your promises.” Eva finally put down her knitting, unable to pretend that she was making her shawl rather than making a mess with the silver-flecked yarn. “Have your plans changed any?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only Sieg’s,” Hilde said. “Mine and Rear Admiral Reuenthal’s are still the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s different about Sieg’s plan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll be in a different part of the capital,” Hilde said. “I’m in charge of an attack on Littenheim’s ships, parked at the airfield.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“By yourself?” Eva couldn’t suppress her alarm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” Hilde said. “I have a few of Duke Braunschweig’s soldiers to help me on the actual day. And Sieg helped me set everything up— it’s mainly going to be automated.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you mind if I ask how?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure,” Hilde said. She got up from her seat and went to pace in front of the windows, gesturing as she explained her plan. She clearly was imitating the way Hank talked, at least subconsciously. “Littenheim has been supplying his men in the city with food and water— he gets supplies from his allies outside the city, and he trucks them in. The trucks are pretty vulnerable as targets. There’s several different groups that have been attacking them to get the food inside—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s that bad in the city?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Yeah,” Hilde said. Her concentration broken, her voice sounded strained. “It’s… pretty bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry— go on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded. “Usually, they leave the trucks on the road. Nothing they can do with them, anyway. Sometimes they burn them out, but they’re useful to </span>
  <em>
    <span>us</span>
  </em>
  <span>, so when we see that a truck has been raided we make noises like we’re reinforcements coming, and the raiders scatter. But really, Sieg and I have been getting into these trucks after they’ve been attacked and installing a backdoor program into their automated driving features. There are a bunch of vehicles that go in and out of the airfield that I have control over now— I can activate it any time I want. Some of the trucks just go into the airfield to park, since that’s where Littenheim is keeping most of his bigger resources, and some are delivering supplies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what are you going to do with them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When my trucks are on their way back into the airfield, I’m going to stop them with my automatic control. Duke Braunschweig’s soldiers will grab the drivers and guards and replace them— steal their IDs, things like that— and we’ll swap any cargo out for explosives. The trucks will drive back to the base and park, the duke’s men will get out and leave the base, or get as far away as they can, and I’ll drive the rigged trucks to destroy the ships.” She shrugged and looked back at Eva. “It’s not the best plan, but it’s what we have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It sounds— I don’t know. Please stay safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will,” Hilde said. She looked out the dark window. “Anyway, it doesn’t have to succeed, really,” she said, sounding a little bitter. “It’s just a distraction. Littenheim’s ships don’t mean very much anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Eva said. She heard footsteps outside the door of the parlor, and Magdalena opened the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dinnertime,” Magdalena said cheerfully. “If you’re all done holding war council in here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, good, I’m starving,” Hilde said. Then the substance of Magdalena’s words seemed to register. “Were you eavesdropping on us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course!” Maggie said. “Knowledge is power.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Captain Oberstein would be annoyed if he learned that my OpSec was this terrible,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t sabotage your little plot,” Magdalena said cheerfully. “You’re just lucky it wasn’t Elfriede listening.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde laughed. “She was half of putting together Herr Reuenthal’s part of the plan in the first place. Do you really think she’d do something like that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, never underestimate El,” Maggie said. “If she’s an expert in anything, it’s cutting off her nose to spite her face.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you all been alright here together?” Hilde asked as she offered her hand to Eva to pull her up from the couch. Eva took it, letting Hilde’s compact strength hoist her to her feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re surviving,” Magdalena said. “At the very least, we can all have a nice, civil dinner together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all headed for the dining room and settled in. The painting of Hank that Eva had painted some time ago was still on the wall, and Hilde smiled at it as she took a seat. “I wish everyone else could be here,” she said. “I miss Hank.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darling, he’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>my</span>
  </em>
  <span> husband,” Magdalena said with a falsely offended sniff. “Only I’m allowed to sigh wistfully at his portrait.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde laughed, and this was the moment that Elfriede came in. She moved silently— the sound of the door didn’t interrupt the conversation— but Hilde was positioned to see her, and her laughter ended abruptly under Elfriede’s glower. Eva hadn’t remembered the two women fighting when they were in the house together before, but her presence chilled the easy camaraderie that Magdalena brought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, don’t let me interrupt you,” Elfriede said as she took her seat near the head of the table. In the entire time the group had been living in the house, the seating arrangements hadn’t changed a bit, and, indeed, Hilde’s empty chair after she had left had been a constant reminder of her absence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not interrupting anything,” Magdalena said. “I’m just glad you’re not late for dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t wait on me? How cruel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assume Hilde has to get back to the city tonight, doesn’t she? I wouldn’t want to delay her too long, or let our dinner get cold.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that true?” Eva asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh— yeah,” Hilde said. “I think it’s better if I head back quickly. And it’s easier to get in and out of the city at night, anyway. Or at least easier than staying until morning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well— you’re harder to see in the dark,” Hilde said. It sounded like she was dodging some important aspect of the question, but Eva didn’t know how to pick a more pointed query, to figure out what Hilde was hiding. She probably wasn’t lying, exactly, but she also had plenty of reasons not to tell Eva things that would worry her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you’re not doing anything too dangerous,” Eva said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde didn’t get a chance to respond, even if she had wanted to, as one of the servants came in with the cart bearing their dinner. Eva thanked him as he poured the wine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How much wine do we have left?” Maggie asked, raising her glass to the light once the food was served and they were alone again. “Are we going to make it through until we can start buying again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could go down into the cellar and look,” Elfriede said. “This isn’t information that anyone is keeping secret.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What I want you to do, El, is go down there and look for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And when you come back up— if we’re running low, you tell me that we have enough to last six years—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if we’re not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if we have plenty to last us an eternity, you tell me that since we’re almost out, it must mean that the civil war’s gone on long enough, and that it’ll all be over soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede laughed, but did not smile. Eva couldn’t remember the last time she had heard Elfried express genuine amusement or happiness. “Why do you think that I would tell you what you want to hear?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I don’t,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even when the war ends, you won’t be able to buy anything,” Elfriede said. “The country’s collapsed. Whatever you have now will have to last you for a lot longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll go with Hank to his estate,” Magdalena said. “His land is famous for wine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede sneered. “Run away, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you found the countryside refreshing. You’re welcome to come with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede’s expression, already grim, chilled further. “I much prefer civilization.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that what this is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, let’s be civilized,” Hilde said, cutting in. “I don’t really understand what you’re fighting about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re not fighting,” Magdalena said, laughing. “I think we’ve just forgotten the art of conversation. I sometimes feel like without men around, I turn into a schoolgirl again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you were so charming as one, weren’t you?” Elfriede asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “Oh, I was,” Magdalena said. “I don’t think anyone could deny that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede turned back to her food.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think there’s plenty of wine left,” Eva said. “I was down in the cellar the other day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doing what?” Magdalena asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heinrich asked me to get his will out of the safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what would he do that for?” Magdalena asked. Her voice held the genuine curiosity of a gossip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He asked me to keep it private.”.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde smiled at her, though the expression was strained with the usual sadness that came from discussing Heinrich. “He trusts you quite a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose,” Eva said. “I’m very grateful for his friendship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unfortunately, he hardly counts as male company,” Elfriede said, rather scathingly. “So Maggie can’t entertain herself with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what you mean by that!” Eva said. She immediately flushed, embarrassed at having lost her temper, but Hilde frowned at Elfriede as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darling,” Magdalena said, quite uncowed, “I’ve never once forgotten who my husband is.” She glanced over at the wall, where the smiling picture of Hank hung, alone in its less sun-faded square.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hilde, trying to break the tension once again, asked, “Eva— why don’t you hang a picture of Herr Mittermeyer up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Eva said, not at all prepared to answer the question, “I hadn’t even thought about putting one in here. I didn’t want to go redecorating Heinrich’s house.” She laughed, but it was a very timid sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only I’m allowed to monopolize the walls. If I let you start putting up pictures of your husband, we would have had to put a picture of Oskar up too, to be fair,” Magdalena said. “And I don’t believe we have one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Eva said, objecting before she thought about the consequences. “I painted one of Herr Reuenthal too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A strange silence fell across the table. “May I see it?” Hilde asked, again trying to be cheerful. “I do like the painting you made of Sieg— and Hank.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now?” Eva asked. She didn’t get an answer, but she had already stood up from the table, abandoning her meal. She wasn’t hungry anyway. “Well, alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She practically ran out of the dining room, and, once she was out, she was so happy to have escaped the oppressive atmosphere that she considered lingering upstairs and not returning. Hilde would wonder where she went, but leaving dinner would be far from the strangest thing any of them had ever done, so it would be excused. But she had been taught early in childhood not to be rude to guests, and Hilde had, through her long absence, become a guest. So she crept into Heinrich’s room (the light from the hallway illuminated his moon-like face, and she could hear his soft breathing) and retrieved the painting of Reuenthal. She didn’t look at it any more than was necessary to pull it out from the stack of rejected watercolor landscapes, and she pressed it to her chest as she came back downstairs, moving too quickly, nervous about nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other three women were sitting in stony silence when she returned, nothing but the clinking of silverware on the porcelain plates to provide a soundtrack. She passed the painting to Hilde without looking at it, then slid into her chair, looking down at her food. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, it’s very nice,” Hilde said. There was something wistful in her voice. “I think you’ve captured his likeness quite well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t know if I had,” Eva said. “I don’t know him as well as I’d like to. It was just from a photo at Maggie’s wedding.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I remember from when I was little, when he came to visit my family’s house— he’d sit in the window to wait for my father. Just like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I drew him too young, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I just always used to wonder what he was thinking about. I don’t think I ever asked— he wouldn’t have told me anyway.” She tried to laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No man can complain about a portrait that looks youthful. Let me see,” Magdalena demanded. Hilde passed the painting over without complaint, though when she handed it over the table, Eva almost wished she would accidentally pass it through one of the candle flames in the center, and set the whole thing alight. But why did it matter if Magdalena saw the picture of Reuenthal?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I’ve seen the photo you painted it from,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wolf took it. I think he thought it was a little too dark to put in the set that he shared with everyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s not well lit,” Eva said, rambling now. “In the photo, I mean. I had to make up most of the face. I could really only use it for the pose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did a good job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Through the conversation, Elfriede had been silent, eating her dinner and scrupulously not looking at the portrait as it passed around the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want it?” Magdalena asked, holding it out to her, though in such a way that she couldn’t see it. Maybe Magdalena would put it in the flames— she would be more likely to do so than Hilde.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede looked up at last, and in a very dry voice, said, “If it was intended for me, it would have been given to me, wouldn’t it have been? You shouldn’t try to make me beg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was going to give it to you,” Eva lied. “I was saving it for your birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Her birthday was last month,” Magdalena said dismissively. “Early February baby. It’s what makes her so grim.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should have told me that!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought I had mentioned it,” Magdalena said. “It must have come up at some point. You know, it certainly did— I told you about the night the two of us snuck out to celebrate. You must have a bad memory.” She waved the picture in front of Elfriede. “Here, take it. Happy birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede’s face had gone on a strange journey as Maggie was speaking, but she stamped her expression down into a frown and took the picture silently. She turned it over so that she could study it, laying it flat on the table. Her comment was not about the painting. “Does Maggie tell you many things about me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I— Yes, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you ask, darling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m curious about what else you’ve seen fit to tell— and why you’ve chosen to tell it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I not allowed to talk about my childhood?” Magdalena asked, though the affront was false. It was masterful how well she had managed the conversation, Eva realized. They hadn’t planned it, and Eva had thought their conversation about paintings was dangerous for different reasons, but Maggie had managed to very pointedly let her know that she had divulged all the secrets that there were to divulge. This was exactly how they had planned to bait Elfriede. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva’s tongue was thick in her mouth— she had never had much of a desire to torment Elfriede, no matter how cruel and nasty the other woman had been at times. She wanted to back out now, to not have any curtains pulled back, either Elfriede’s or hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was too late. Magdalena’s eyes narrowed on her, and Eva knew that if she tried to back down, Magdalena would push through regardless. She would figure out a way to enrage the other woman in just the right way, with or without Eva’s participation. Maybe they were perfect for each other, in that way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can say what you like,” Elfriede said. “I will never understand why you feel the need.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t like to think about happier times, when we’re stuck here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She didn’t tell me very much,” Eva said. She felt pitiful, and she knew she was sabotaging her own plans. “It wasn’t—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Scandalous?” Elfriede asked. She picked up her wine glass and tipped it towards the light. “You’re so naive— it’s very funny.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva flushed. “Maybe I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are worse things to be,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The scandal,” Elfriede said. “It doesn’t matter if she told you explicitly or not. I’m sure you understand exactly what happened, or at least what Maggie wants you to think happened.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva stayed silent, looking down at her plate. Elfriede wasn’t even looking at her. Her eyes were fixed somewhere above Magdalena’s head, that frozen gaze directionless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After all— you know as well as I do what dear Maggie is like. And I’m sure you know why I was taken away from the capital and chained up like a dog—” She let her voice get too wild, and she caught herself, returning to an even, cold keel. “If she’s telling stories about our happy days in school, you can make guesses, even if she didn’t give you any details.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what are you upset about me saying, if it’s all public information?” Magdalena asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, I almost thought you had changed while I was gone. It’s comforting to know that nobody changes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop talking in riddles,” Magdalena snapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede finally turned to Eva. “She loves helpless, naive, pretty little things, you know. The mistake she made with me was that I’m not one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s quite enough,” Hilde said, interrupting the conversation. The other three had almost forgotten that she was there, but her face was red too. “I don’t know what you’re all accusing each other of, but—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not accusing Eva of anything,” Elfriede said. She leaned back in her seat. “There’s never been a more faithful woman to her husband.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what are you accusing me of, if nothing, as you say, has happened, or will happen, or is even capable of happening?” Magdalena asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what—” Hilde tried to break in again. But Elfriede kept talking right over her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But it’s not like I haven’t seen this all before. You had to find someone to confide in, someone you could turn against me, to make yourself look like the innocent victim. This perfect little story you made up in your head— I don’t even think you believe it— but it gets you what you want. Sympathy, and once you have that—!” She laughed again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eva,” Magdalena said. “Please tell Elfriede exactly what story I told you. I wasn’t lying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, who isn’t a liar?” Elfriede asked. “But tell me. I’m curious.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Evangeline felt like she was being pressed between two panes of glass, suffocated and on display. “She didn’t tell me very much,” she managed to say again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leave Eva alone,” Hilde protested. “I don’t know why you have to involve her.” She trailed off as the other two women ignored her, staring Eva down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “I asked her why talking about Erwin Josef upset her so much,” Eva said. “She told me that it was because she had loved—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you knew that before,” Magdalena snapped. “Talk about when we were at school.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva’s words were robotic and stumbling as she tried to bring to mind the story Magdalena had told. “You were— friends—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, but go on,” Elfriede said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were at school, and one of the older girls, Susanna, told you both to stay away from each other—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There were rumors,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you couldn’t be seen with each other anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And then what?” Elfriede asked. “Come on, Eva, tell me the story.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie made friends with Ingrid, and you were jealous—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede again laughed aloud. “Oh, gods, keep going, this is very funny.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In what way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s very funny to call you friends with Ingrid,” she said. “And it’s less that I was jealous, and more that you lied to her, and told her that I was—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have this innocent little routine,” Elfriede said. “If you’re telling poor little Ingrid that I was the one who manipulated you, that it wasn’t your fault, that of course I was the dangerous one, and the one nobody should ever go near or else they’ll be </span>
  <em>
    <span>contaminated</span>
  </em>
  <span>— well, it’s a funny little game you like to play with people, when of course it only ends one way. But go on,” she said to Eva. “What happened next?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were jealous, and you turned them in,” Eva said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And then what did innocent little Maggie do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Her family paid the school—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Elfriede said. “No, no— what was it that got me locked up for years and years?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t have said anything if you hadn’t worked so hard to ruin me,” Magdalena said. “If you had just let things lie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did you do?” Eva asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you already,” Magdalena said. She was either truly annoyed with Eva or a good actor. “I just made it clear that she was the one who made it impossible for us all to have a peaceful coexistence at school. Which was true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did she tell you that she went through my belongings, and turned them in?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That wasn’t what got you sent away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede was silent for a deeply uncomfortable stretch. “Because you turned everyone against me first. I wasn’t any more guilty than you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did that to yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede turned to Eva again. “And do you believe that?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, darling, do you?” Magdalena asked. “Do you think I had to do anything to make people want her gone?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva was helpless and she opened her mouth without saying anything to answer the question. “I don’t know,” she said. Her voice cracked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can tell her what you really think,” Magdalena said. “I think she can handle it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you love to make people cruel. You’re so good at it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Elfriede and Magdalena argued, Hilde reached towards Eva, touched her arm as it rested on the table, and mouthed, “Let’s go?” But Eva was frozen, and didn’t register Hilde’s vain attempt to rescue her. Stymied, Hilde was forced to remain and watch the confrontation play out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I have any responsibility for making you the way you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you trying to do to her, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing, absolutely nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No— you’re trying lots of things. They’re just not working.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maggie hasn’t done anything to me,” Eva said, her voice weak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You just don’t see her trying,” Elfriede said. “You are very naive. Or blind. Intentionally.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go on, tell me what she’s blind about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfried paused, and a strange smile slid over her face. “You know, Mags, I suppose I should apologize.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, darling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you were trying to make her cruel, you would have used all the tools at your disposal. You’ve been keeping the best one for yourself. But I suppose if you really succeeded, she wouldn’t be your innocent type anymore. You like to toy with your food. You have to save the worst for right before you’re done with her— the denouement— get what you want, and then let her go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you talking about?” Eva asked, though she knew very well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s tried to turn you against me, but she hasn’t tried to turn you against your husband yet, has she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I get along with Herr Mittermeyer quite well,” Magdalena said. “Why would I ever want to do a thing like that? And, furthermore, how could I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t play dumb. It doesn’t suit you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It only suits me,” Eva said. The words came out unbidden. “Doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede laughed. “Oh, yes. It does.” For the first time, she sounded genuine. “It suits you very well. I’m quite sorry for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A hot lump formed in her throat, and when she tried to speak, nothing came out. Her eyes were burning, and Hilde tried again to put her hand on Eva’s arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Eva, let’s go,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva almost took her up on the offer, but she couldn’t move. “I’m not stupid,” she protested vainly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Magdalena said, sounding resigned. “You’re just kind. Maybe that’s the same thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A silence fell across the table. Elfriede looked down at the painting of Reuenthal, then held it out to Eva. She didn’t take it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s yours,” Eva said, though she was barely holding back tears. “Keep it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Elfriede asked. “I don’t love him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Eva couldn’t say anything to that, Elfriede relented and kept the painting. She stood up from the table, and Hilde visibly relaxed at the sign that she was about to leave. But it was Eva who stopped her. “Wait, Elfriede—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” She stood in the doorway, her face already being swallowed by the shadows of the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to be cruel,” Eva said. “I don’t want you to think that I could be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everyone can be. That’s how it works.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede almost walked away again, but Magdalena spoke up. “Did you think you’d become cruel, El?” she asked. “Do you think that’s what you wanted, as a kid? What you imagined yourself being?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elfriede scoffed. “That’s what being naive is. You don’t know what you’re like until you’re tested. Maybe I was— I don’t know. I don’t remember. You must have liked something about me— maybe that was it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I should apologize to you,” Magdalena said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t bother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or, you haven’t tried to make Eva into someone else either— I should thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“By telling her secrets?” Elfriede asked. Her invisible gaze was heavy as she stared at Eva from the shadow of the doorway. “In some ways, it’s much funnier to watch you suffer in your dream world, Maggie. I’ll leave you to it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What dream world?” Magdalena asked. She was clearly getting desperate— Elfriede was about to walk away, and all their plans would fall apart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The one where you have a secret key that will make things go your way. But I think you know if you use it, everything will just fall apart, so you’ve trapped yourself by holding onto it, locked yourself into the room. But it’ll fall apart without you, someday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would tell her, if she wanted to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But she doesn’t. She doesn’t want to know if she’s capable of being cruel or not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think so little of me,” Eva said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t you make Magdalena tell you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to hate her for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what about your husband?” Elfriede asked. It was strange— Wolf had barely been addressed before now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think— I don’t know. I don’t want to hate him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you hate me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Eva said, and found that to be true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a strange silence, and then Elfriede spoke. “Your husband is cheating on you. He’s been sleeping with Oskar since before you were married. He loves him more than he loves you.” A bitter twist of her face showed the glint of her teeth in the shadows of the doorway. “And Oskar certainly loves him more than he loves me, but I suppose that isn’t difficult. Goodnight.” And then she turned and left, the soft sound of her footsteps receding down the dark hallway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the horrible silence that was left, Magdalena said, “You don’t have to ask me if it’s true. It is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The world outside of Eva’s eyes had narrowed down to one tiny point of light, the candle flame in the center of the table. She stared at it until the bright speck engulfed her vision, the light making a blind spot when she turned away from it. She didn’t cry. She would do that later, when she was alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you alright, Eva?” Hilde asked. Eva felt bad for her, and she focused on that feeling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hilde,” she said. “I’m going to say goodbye to Heinrich. And then, could you drive me—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are you going?” Magdalena asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was theater. They had already planned exactly where Eva would go, a place where they could stage the next phase of their plan. But somehow it felt like an organic choice now— Eva couldn’t stay here, and she had nowhere else to go. No cozy apartment waiting for her in the city, and she couldn’t go back to Wolf’s parents, a few districts away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she didn’t want to talk to Magdalena either. She kept addressing Hilde. “Can you take me to Count Landsberg’s house?” she asked. “I don’t know where else I can go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On short notice? Nowhere,” Magdalena said. “You don’t have to leave, Eva.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take you there,” Hilde said. “Or— I can find a place for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to worry about me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do,” Hilde said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eva nodded and stood. The little burned out patch in her vision from staring at the candle made it easy to not look at Magdalena’s face as she walked out, and the darkness of the hallway felt absolute. She stumbled through it by memory alone, trying not to creak the stairs on her way up to Heinrich’s room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His bedroom was the same refuge it had always been, and she didn’t notice he was awake as she sat down at his bedside. She hadn’t turned on the light, and his eyes were closed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I heard you come in earlier,” he said, startling her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was getting a painting for Elfriede,” she said. Her voice was raw, and he immediately understood that something was wrong. Blindly, he reached out his skeletal hand towards her. She couldn’t take it, and so he left it laying on the bedspread, just in her reach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m leaving tonight, Heinrich.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did something happen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I can talk about it,” Eva said. “Ask Maggie to tell you, once I’m gone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded and was silent. She was grateful for that, for everything about his companionship. If there hadn’t been wheels in motion that she was now powerless to stop, she would have stayed in the house with him. His friendship would have been enough to keep her there. But even though the plan to rescue Erwin Josef was only a distant thought, far off and unreal, it was enough to force her to move. But still, she could sit there for a moment longer, dash her silent tears away with the back of her hand. His eyes were still closed— he didn’t see her crying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took off her wedding ring. It had been a permanent fixture on her hand for years, and she felt naked and empty without it on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you do me a favor?” she asked, though her voice was thick with tears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She picked up Heinrich’s hand from the bedspread and pressed her wedding ring into his palm. She curled his fingers around it and held his hand between both of hers. “If anything happens to me— tell Wolf I forgive him. Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that true?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It has to be,” she whispered. “I don’t want to be cruel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.” She kept holding his hand in hers. She could hear, down the stairs, Hilde moving around and talking with Magdalena, though their voices were too distant to make out in anything other than indistinct tones. Hilde was angry— short and clipped sentences.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m being cruel to you, aren’t I?” she asked Heinrich suddenly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about me.” She understood what he meant, and there was no way to argue with him about it. He would do this because he loved her— the kind of love that asked only for the other’s happiness, or wanted to ask only for that, if that was the only thing that was within reach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it was true that she could forgive Wolf. Maybe she already had, at the bottom of her heart, prepared for this moment for as long as she had known there was a moment to prepare for. It was a foregone conclusion that she would forgive him, no matter how painful it might be to go through, and to come out the other side. But if that was true, what would she do with the pain she held? Where would it go?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The idea flitted through her mind, and if it had been any other day, any other hour, she would have rejected it. But she wondered, just for a moment, if balancing the scales of that pain would be enough to relieve her— even if only a fraction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there anything else I can do?” Heinrich asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She kept one hand on his, pinned to the bedspread, but with her other she reached out to touch his forehead, stroking his hair back from his forehead. Her fingers tangled through the bone white strands for a moment, and he stayed perfectly still, like a corpse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She leaned forward, hovering her face just over his. She could feel his shallow breath on her skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eva—” he said. His eyes were still closed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t do something you’ll regret,” he said. “Not right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked at how thin his skin was— the way all his veins were visible, even in the dim light of the room, at the cracks in his lips, at the weakness of his arms. There would always be something to regret, she supposed, regardless of what she did or didn’t do. And so she kissed him anyway, briefly, but enough to wet his lips and make his hand curl against hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodbye, Heinrich,” she said. She didn’t say anything about meeting again— she rather doubted that they would.</span>
